### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking for the existence of a table.
3. When `partition` is not provided, the function is checking if the table name is present in the output of `show tables`. When `partition` is provided, it is constructing a command to check for partitions but not properly validating the result.
4. The bug seems to be in the `else` block where the function is trying to check for partition information. The condition `if stdout:` will return `True` even if there is no data in `stdout`.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly validate the output of the Hive commands for both cases and return `True` only if the table/partition exists.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
    
            return table in stdout.split("\n")

# Updated line: `return table in stdout.split("\n")` to properly check for the table in the partition output
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newline characters and checking if the table is present in the partition output, we ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of the table while considering the partition information as well.
