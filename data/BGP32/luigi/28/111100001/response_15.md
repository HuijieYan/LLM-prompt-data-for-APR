### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database using a given table name, database name, and optional partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect string formatting in the hive command when a partition is specified. This leads to incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table with a partition.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the hive command is formatted correctly with the provided table, database, and partition information.
5. We should also update the `table_exists` function to return `True` only if the table is found in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the string formatting in the Hive command when a partition is specified.
2. Modify the condition for returning `True` in the `table_exists` function to check if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ",".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            hive_cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(hive_cmd)
            return stdout and partition_str in stdout
``` 

By modifying the way the hive command is formatted and adding a check for the partition string in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, we can fix the bug in the `table_exists` function.
