### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` accepts a `table`, `database`, and optional `partition` parameter.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive query and check if a table exists in the specified database with optional partition details.
3. The issue lies in how the function checks for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.
4. The function returns `True` if the table name is found in the stdout output, but the checking logic is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the comparison logic of the function. When checking for the existence of the table in the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd`, the function incorrectly checks for just the presence of the table name in the output. This approach is incorrect because the table name could appear in combination with other text.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to ensure that the table name appears as a separate word in the stdout output. We can achieve this by splitting the lines in the stdout by newline characters and then checking each line for an exact match with the table name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking each line for an exact match with the table name, we ensure a more accurate verification of the table's existence. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
