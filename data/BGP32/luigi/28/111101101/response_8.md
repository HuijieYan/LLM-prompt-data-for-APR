### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the function checks for the existence of a table in Hive based on the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first part of the function where no partition is specified, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` output, but the comparison is done incorrectly leading to incorrect return values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the `stdout` output from Hive and compare it with the `table` name to determine if the table exists. Additionally, handling the case insensitivity for table names would be essential for the function to work as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from typing import Union

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None) -> bool:
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(partition.items() <= dict(item.split("=") for item in line.strip().split("/")).items() for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the query in the `run_hive_cmd` function with `show tables in {0}` to ensure it works correctly.
2. Changed the comparison in the if condition to check if the `table` is present in the list of tables by splitting the `stdout`.
3. Made the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
4. Modified the query for checking partitions to compare the items in the partition dictionary with the parsed items from the output lines.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now accurately determine whether a table exists in Hive, factoring in the case insensitivity requirement and proper parsing of partition specifications.
