### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `table` name in the `stdout` variable. The bug occurs because the function only checks if the `table` name exists as a whole in the `stdout`, leading to false positives. For example, if `stdout` contains `"OK\nmytable_another"`, the function would incorrectly return `True`. The bug originates from the comparison logic in the line `return stdout and table in stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison checks for the exact table name and not just a substring match. One way to achieve this is by splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then comparing each line with the exact table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters and then checking each line with the exact table name, we ensure that the function only returns `True` if the exact table name is found in the results. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle table existence checks.
