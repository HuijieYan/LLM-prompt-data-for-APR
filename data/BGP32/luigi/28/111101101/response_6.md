The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. The function is incorrectly checking if the table name is present in the entire `stdout` string, which can lead to false positives. It should instead split the `stdout` by newlines and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This fixed version splits the `stdout` string by newlines before checking if the table name is present in the output. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table within the `stdout`.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
