## Bug Explanation

The bug in the code is caused by how the `table_exists` function is handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the `table_exists` function, it checks whether the table exists based on whether the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the table name might be part of another string in the output. For example, if the output contains multiple lines and one of the lines has the table name, the function incorrectly identifies the table as existing.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to ensure that it accurately checks if the table name is a standalone entry in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

## The Corrected Version of the Code

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return bool(partitions)
```

By splitting the output lines and checking if the table name is a standalone entry in the output, we ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly identifies whether the table exists in the database. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
