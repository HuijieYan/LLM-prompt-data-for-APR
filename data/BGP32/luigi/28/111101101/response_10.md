The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` output. The function incorrectly checks if the exact `table` name is present in the `stdout` output, causing the failing tests. The correct approach should be to split the `stdout` output by newline characters and check if the exact `table` name exists in the resulting list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the function. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters and checking if the `table` name is present in the resulting list, we ensure a correct comparison and fix the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and match the expected input/output values provided for each case.
