The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string, but this check is failing due to an incorrect comparison approach.

The function is returning `stdout and table in stdout` in the first case without considering the exact matching of the table name in the `stdout`. The same issue is happening in the second case.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison to check for exact matches of the table name within the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table == stdout.strip()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version will compare the `table` and the `stdout` string as exact matches, resolving the bug and making the function behave as expected for the failing tests.
