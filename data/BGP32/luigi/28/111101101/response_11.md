## Bug Analysis
The main issue with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a table in Hive. In particular, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not sufficient to assert the table's existence, as it only checks if the table name is contained in the output.

Additionally, the second part of the function where it checks for partitions is not correctly formatting the Hive query string, potentially leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the first case, the function is returning `stdout and table in stdout`. This condition will be True if `stdout` is non-empty, regardless of whether the table actually exists in the output. This results in incorrect behavior.
2. In the second case, the function is checking for table existence using the same flawed logic. The expected value of `stdout` contains both "OK" and "mytable", but the buggy function only needs "mytable" to confirm table existence.
3. In the third and fourth cases involving partitions, the bug may lie in the incorrect formatting of the Hive query string when checking for the existence of partitions. This could lead to wrong results being returned.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. In the table existence checks, modify the condition to check if the table name is directly equal to an entry in the output.
2. Ensure that the Hive query string for partition existence is correctly formatted to accurately check for partition existence.

## Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {{ {2} }}".format(database, table, ', '.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the condition for table existence check and improving the formatting of the Hive query for partition existence, the corrected function should now pass all failing tests and correctly determine the existence of tables and partitions in Hive.
