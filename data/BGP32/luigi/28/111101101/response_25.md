### Bug in the Buggy Function:

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the `stdout` variable. In Case 2 and Case 5 where the `table_exists` function is expected to return `True`, it incorrectly returns `False`. This is because the buggy function checks whether `stdout` is not empty, but it should be checking if the table name is present in the `stdout` content.

### Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the check for the table name in the `stdout` variable. Instead of just evaluating if `stdout` is not empty, we should check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` content.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```

By modifying the condition to check for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout` content, we ensure that the function correctly returns `True` when the table exists and `False` when it doesn't exist. This correction aligns with the expected behavior in the failing tests.
