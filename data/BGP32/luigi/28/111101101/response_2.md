The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the inconsistent handling of the output `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The buggy function expects the `run_hive_cmd` function to return output that includes the table name(s) when checking for table existence. However, in some cases, the function fails to recognize the table name(s) correctly in the output `stdout`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we parse the `stdout` to accurately identify whether the table exists or not.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean value of stdout
```

By returning the boolean value of `stdout` directly, we ensure that the function correctly evaluates the presence of the table without relying on specific content within the `stdout`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and accurately determine the existence of tables in the provided database, both with and without partitions.
