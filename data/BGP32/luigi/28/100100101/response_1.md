### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of tables or partitions.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition checking the presence of the table/partition in the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The issue lies in the `return stdout and table in stdout` condition which does not handle the cases where the table name is a substring of another table name, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function uses a naive string matching approach to check the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output. This approach fails when the table name is a substring of another table name present in the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of checking table existence to ensure an exact match rather than a substring match.

### Updated Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters and checking if the exact table name exists in the list of tables, we ensure that matches are exact. This corrected logic should pass the failing tests and provide the expected results.
