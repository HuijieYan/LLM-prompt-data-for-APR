### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the case where the table name is found in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. There are issues with the conditional checks and the way the output is being parsed.

### Error
The buggy function fails to properly check if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` does not accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition to explicitly check for the presence of the table name in the output.
2. Ensure that the table name is properly extracted from the output when parsing.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table in stdout` condition has been replaced with `table in stdout.splitlines()` to properly check if the table name exists in the output.
- The conditional return statement has been simplified to `return bool(stdout)` to handle both cases where the output is empty or not.
