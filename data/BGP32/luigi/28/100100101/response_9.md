### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` has issues with the conditional logic inside the function. The function checks if `stdout` has a value and then checks if the table is in `stdout`. However, the function does not handle the case where `stdout` is an empty string properly. This results in incorrect behavior in the test cases when `stdout` is empty.

### Bug Explanation
For the failing test cases, the buggy function fails to correctly handle the scenarios where `stdout` is empty. In these cases, the function does not return `False` as expected when the table does not exist in the database.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should update the logic in the function to properly handle the case where `stdout` is an empty string. We need to ensure that the function returns `False` when `stdout` is empty, indicating that the table does not exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:  # Check if stdout is not empty
            return table in stdout
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By adding a check for `stdout` to see if it is empty before checking if the table is in `stdout`, we ensure that the function behaves correctly even when `stdout` is empty. This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
