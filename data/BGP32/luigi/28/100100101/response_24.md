## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database in Hive. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable and checks if the table exists.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function is related to how the function checks if a table exists in the database. In the first part of the function when checking without a partition, the return condition is `return stdout and table in stdout`, which is incorrect. The function should actually return `return table in stdout` as the presence of `stdout` itself implies that the table exists. 

In the second part of the function when a partition is provided, the condition for returning `True` or `False` is reversed. The function should return `False` if `stdout` is empty and `True` if it is not.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct the return conditions in both parts of the function: one for without partition and one for with partition.

## Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By using the corrected function above, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
