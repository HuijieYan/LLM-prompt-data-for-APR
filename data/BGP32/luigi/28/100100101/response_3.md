### Analysis:
The buggy `table_exists` function has a logic issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise, but the current implementation is not handling the conditions correctly.

The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the output from `run_hive_cmd` and evaluating it by checking if the table name is present in the output. However, the logic is not working as intended.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case 1, the expected output from the `run_hive_cmd` is "OK", which should result in `table_exists` returning `False`. However, the function is not properly evaluating the stdout and returning incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and determine if the table exists based on the stdout.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
``` 

By splitting the stdout on the new line character and checking for table names in the lines, we can determine if the table exists correctly in both cases. This corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
