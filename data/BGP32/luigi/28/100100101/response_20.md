The buggy function has a logical error in the conditional statements where it always returns False or True based on the existence of `stdout` but does not take into consideration the specific values in `stdout`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the expected `table` is present in the `stdout` output. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split("\n") if line)

```

This corrected function checks if the `table` is present in each line of the `stdout` output in cases where a partition is given. This change should pass the failing tests provided.
