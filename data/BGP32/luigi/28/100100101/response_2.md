The buggy function is checking if a table exists in a database using Hive queries. The bug occurs in the first code block because the condition for checking the existence of the table is incorrect.

The bug causes the function to return the opposite of the expected result in the first case. It returns `True` when it should be `False` since the stdout contains 'OK' but the table is not in stdout.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition to check if the table is present in the stdout. If it is present, return True, else return False.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
