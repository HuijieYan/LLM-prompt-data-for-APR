The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly checks for the existence of the table name directly within the output string, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to parse the output string correctly and check for the table name in a more robust way.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        exists = any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
        
        return exists
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. In the first branch of the if-else statement, the output of `run_hive_cmd` is split by newline characters, and then we check if the `table` exists in the list of tables obtained. This ensures a more accurate check for the table existence.
2. In the second branch, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout`, indicating the existence of partitions.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
