### Analyzing the Bug
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with the conditional checks when handling partitions. It fails to correctly identify whether a table exists or not based on the given parameters. The issue is mainly with how the `stdout` variable is being checked.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first case, when checking for a table without partitions, the function should return `True` if the table exists in the `stdout` variable. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks for `stdout` alone, leading to incorrect results.

2. In the second case, similar to the first case, the function fails to properly parse the `stdout` when a table with a space-separated name is provided.

3. In the third case, regarding tables with partitions, the check for partition existence is incorrect. The function doesn't handle the given partition information properly when checking the `stdout`, leading to false negatives.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition in the first case to check if the table name exists in `stdout` instead of just checking the presence of `stdout`.
2. Modify the check in the second case to properly parse the `stdout` for the table name if it's in a multi-line format.
3. Revise the partition check in the third case to handle the partition information correctly from the given parameters in a structured way.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partitions = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s" % (database, table))
        if partitions:
            for part in partitions.split("\n"):
                if all([f"{k}={v}" in part for k, v in partition.items()]):
                    return True
        return False
``` 

By updating the `table_exists` function as shown above, it should correctly handle the cases mentioned and pass the failing test cases with the expected inputs and outputs.
