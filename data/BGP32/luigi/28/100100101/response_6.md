The problem with the buggy function lies in the conditional check `if stdout:` in the `else` block. The issue occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function response is being directly used in the condition, leading to an incorrect evaluation.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `stdout` variable contains the specific partition information instead of solely relying on its existence. We can perform this check by looking for the partition information within the `stdout` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        # Check if the partition information is present in stdout
        return any('partition' in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

This corrected version handles the partition case more accurately by checking if the word 'partition' exists in any line of the `stdout` variable. This modification ensures that the function returns `True` only when the partition information is found in the output.

After implementing this correction, the function should pass all the failing test cases provided.
