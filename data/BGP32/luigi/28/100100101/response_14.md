## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` has conditional logic based on whether `partition` is `None` or not. In the first case, it performs a command using `run_hive_cmd` and checks if the table exists in the output. In the second case, it attempts to fetch partition information for a specific table, but the condition checking and return statements are inconsistent.

The failing test provides multiple scenarios where the function fails to return the correct result due to incorrect handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd` in both cases.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the case where `partition` is `None`, the function incorrectly checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`. The logical error lies in the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. This results in incorrect behavior when the table name is in the output but not standalone.

2. For the case where `partition` is specified, the function expects True/False as the return value based on whether `stdout` has content. The faulty logic fails to return the correct boolean result based on the presence of partitions.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure the correct comparison of strings and handle the conditions for both scenarios adequately. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't in all cases.

## Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, the `table in stdout` check is replaced with `table in stdout.split()` to handle cases where the table name might not be standalone in the output. Additionally, the return statements are modified to ensure the function returns `True` if the table/partition exists and `False` otherwise.
