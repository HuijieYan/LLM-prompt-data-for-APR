#### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a logic issue where it is not correctly handling the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expecting a specific format in the `stdout` response to determine if the table exists, but the comparison logic is flawed. 

#### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison `return stdout and table in stdout`. The function only checks if `table in stdout`, which is not sufficient to determine if the table exists. The correct approach would be to split the `stdout` response by newlines and then check if the table name exists in the list.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Split the `stdout` response by newlines to get a list of tables.
2. Check if the `table` name exists in this list to determine if the table exists.

#### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the mentioned changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
