The buggy function is `table_exists`, which has two branches based on whether the `partition` parameter is provided. The bug seems to be due to incorrect logic in returning the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. 

1. In the first branch (`partition is None`), the function checks if the table is in the `stdout` by using `table in stdout`. However, this logic is flawed because `stdout` could be any string that contains the table name. The function erroneously relies on truthiness of `stdout` and whether the table name is in `stdout`.
   
2. In the second branch (`partition is not None`), the function checks if `stdout` has any value and returns `True` if it does. This approach is incorrect since a non-empty `stdout` does not necessarily indicate that the table exists.

To fix the bug, the function should verify that in the first branch, the table name appears as a distinct entry in the `stdout` string, and in the second branch, it should match any partition specified.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(partition_str in partition for partition in partitions)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles checking the existence of tables and partitions based on the provided parameters.
