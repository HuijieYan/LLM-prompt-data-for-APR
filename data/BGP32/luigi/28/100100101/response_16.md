### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the condition checks for whether a table or partition exists. The issue seems to be with the logic of evaluating the `stdout` variable to determine if the table/partition exists.

### Bug:
In the current implementation of the `table_exists` function, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` for checking table existence is flawed. It assumes that the table name should directly match a line in `stdout`, which may not always be the case due to variations like whitespace, newlines, etc.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition for checking table existence to handle variations in the output string.
2. Make sure to correctly handle the case insensitivity requirement mentioned in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the condition to check if any table name matches in a case-insensitive manner and correctly evaluating the output, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
