## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` currently has an issue with handling the conditions for returning `True` or `False` based on the result obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises from how the `stdout` variable is checked for truthiness, leading to incorrect evaluation in certain scenarios.

## Identified Bug
The bug is in both branches of the if-else statement where `stdout` is checked for truthiness. In the first branch, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might not account for cases where the expected table is not the only entry in the `stdout`. In the second branch, the condition `if stdout` only checks for the presence of output but does not account for specific partition information.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. In the first branch, ensure that the specific table is correctly identified within the `stdout` without being part of another table's name.
2. In the second branch, validate the presence of both the table name and the correct partition information in the `stdout` to return `True`.

## Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        if stdout and table in stdout and partition_str in stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

## Summary of Changes
1. In the first branch, split the `stdout` by newline to ensure that the specific table matches exactly.
2. In the second branch, validate the presence of both the table name and the correct partition string in the `stdout` to return `True` accordingly.
