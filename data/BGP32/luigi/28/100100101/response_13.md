The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout`. In the code snippet provided, for the case when `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the table name is in the `stdout`, which can cause issues if the table name is part of another word or string in the output. 

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the condition to use a more robust check. One approach is to split the `stdout` based on newline characters and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version includes splitting the `stdout` for the case of checking table existence without partition and directly returning a boolean for the case with partitions.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided while also satisfying the expected input/output values for all cases.
