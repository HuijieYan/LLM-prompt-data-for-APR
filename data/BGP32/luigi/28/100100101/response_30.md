### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a given table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition. The issues in the function lie in the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. The function returns the result of that comparison which is not correctly handled.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first case, when checking if a table named `mytable` exists in the `default` database, the `stdout` should contain `'OK'`, but the function only checks if the table name is present in `stdout` and returns accordingly.
   
2. In the second case, a similar issue occurs where the `stdout` contains `'OK\nmytable'` which could lead to incorrect results due to improper handling of the table name comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the comparison is done between `stdout` and the table name. We should split the `stdout` string into lines and then compare each line with the table name to ensure an exact match. Additionally, we need to consider case-insensitivity for table name comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(name.lower() == table.lower() for name in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(partition == self.partition_spec(part) for part in partitions)
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the output (`stdout`) into lines when checking for the table name in the database tables or partitions.
- Comparisons are now case-insensitive, ensuring that the correct table names are identified regardless of case.
- The function now checks if the given table name matches any table in the list of tables/partitions obtained from `stdout`.
- The corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
