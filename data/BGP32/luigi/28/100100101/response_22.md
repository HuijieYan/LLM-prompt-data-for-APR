The bug in the provided function is related to how the function is checking the presence of a table in Hive. The `table_exists` function is incorrectly checking if the table name is present in the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without proper handling of newlines. This leads to incorrect evaluation of the condition.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to split the stdout by newlines and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list of tables.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version splits the stdout by newline character and then performs the table name check.

By fixing this issue, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
