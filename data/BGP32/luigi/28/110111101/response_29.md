### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database using command line invocations.
2. The function checks for the existence of a table and with an optional partition.
3. The bug seems to be in the conditional logic of returning `True` or `False` based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The bug is leading to incorrect evaluation of the table existence, resulting in failing test cases.
5. The primary issue is with how the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being processed to determine table existence.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the buggy function `table_exists`, the logic to check if a table exists is incorrect.
2. When partition is not None, the function calls `run_hive_cmd` with a command that checks for the selected table and the provided partition.
3. The current implementation does not handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly when checking for tables with partitions, leading to incorrect evaluation of table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The buggy function should check the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function and properly handle the output to determine table existence.
2. Proper conditional checks should be implemented to correctly evaluate the existence of tables with or without partitions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            return any(partition_spec in line for line in stdout.split('\n')) if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- The function checks if the `partition_spec` is present in any line of the `stdout` to determine the existence of the provided partition.
- The function now handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` correctly to validate table existence with partitions.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and correctly determine the presence of tables with or without partitions.
