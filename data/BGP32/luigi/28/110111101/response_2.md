### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the conditionals are structured. In the first conditional branch, the function checks if `table` is in the `stdout` variable and returns accordingly. However, in the second conditional branch, the function simply checks if `stdout` exists and doesn't evaluate whether `table` exists within `stdout`. This leads to incorrect behavior when determining if a table exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly evaluates the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable for both conditional branches. This can be achieved by adjusting the comparison in the second branch to check if `table` is in `stdout` as well.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout  # Adjusted to check if table is in stdout

```

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function should now correctly check if the table exists in the `stdout` variable for both cases, passing all the failing tests and meeting the expected input/output values.
