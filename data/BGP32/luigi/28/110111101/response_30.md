### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function aims to check if a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands.
2. There are two main branches in the function:
   - If `partition` is None, it constructs a command to run Hive query to show tables.
   - If `partition` is provided, it constructs a command to show partitions based on the provided partition details and then executes it using `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The bug occurs when the function checks if the stdout is empty or not to determine if the table exists. This logic is incorrect because even if stdout is not empty, it may not contain the table name.
4. To fix this bug:
   - We need to split the stdout based on newlines and then check if the table name is present in any line to accurately determine if the table exists.
   - The function should properly handle case sensitivity for table names.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return any(table.lower() == line.strip().lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return any(table.lower() == line.strip().lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
``` 

By implementing this corrected version, the function will correctly check if the table name exists in the output of the Hive commands, considering case insensitivity. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
