### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` uses `run_hive_cmd` to check if a table exists in a given database. The issue arises in the logic flow where the function returns `True` when it should return `False` and vice versa due to incorrect handling of stdout.
2. The function has two main branches depending on the presence of a partition. The issue appears to lie in the handling of the `stdout` variable in both branches.
3. When the `table` is found in the stdout, the function should return `True` but returns `False`, and vice versa.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditions for returning `True` or `False` based on the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`.
5. Updated version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
``` 

By correcting the return conditions based on the presence of `table` in `stdout`, the function should now return the expected values and pass the failing tests.
