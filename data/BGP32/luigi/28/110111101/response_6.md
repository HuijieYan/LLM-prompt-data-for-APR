The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect comparison and handling of the `stdout` variable. The function is assuming that if `stdout` contains any value, it means the table exists. However, this logic is flawed as the `stdout` may contain other information as well.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout` output.

Here is the corrected version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.splitlines()  # Check if the table is in the lines of the output
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".
                                  format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(partition.items() <= dict(row.items()) for row in csv.DictReader(stdout.splitlines(), delimiter='\t'))
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and checks if the table name is present in those lines for the table existence. Additionally, for checking partition existence, it properly parses the output and compares the partition key-value pairs with the expected partition.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly determine the existence of tables and partitions, and it should pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
