The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the conditions to check if a table exists or not are incorrect. The function is always returning `True` or `False` based on whether any output is received. Instead, it should be checking if the table actually exists in the output received from the Hive command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison in both branches of the if-else statement to correctly check if the table exists in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition {self.partition_spec(partition)}')
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly pass the failing tests and return the expected output in all cases provided.
