The bug in the `table_exists()` function is caused by the conditional statements not correctly handling the presence of table names in the `stdout`. The comparison logic in the `if` conditions is incorrect, leading to incorrect return values. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly check for the presence of the table name in the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists()` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

With this correction, the function now properly checks for the existence of the table name in the `stdout` output and returns the correct result based on that check.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
