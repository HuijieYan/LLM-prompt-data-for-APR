The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the way it checks for the existence of a table. The bug is that it returns `False` when it should actually return `True` in the scenarios where the table does exist. This is leading to failed test cases that expect the function to return `True` when the table exists.

The issue arises from the `if stdout` check for whether the command execution was successful. The function incorrectly returns `False` if `stdout` is empty, even when the table actually exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function so that it correctly determines whether the table exists based on the value of `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. If `stdout` is not `None`, it means the command was successful, and if the table is present in `stdout`, it returns `True`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
