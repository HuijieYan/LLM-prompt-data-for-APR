### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. When determining if a table exists, the function checks the output of a Hive command but does not handle the case where the table name might be included within a larger string in the output. This leads to incorrect results and consequently failing tests.

In the failing test cases, particularly when the table name is part of a string (e.g., "OK\nmytable"), the function incorrectly returns False instead of True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to properly handle cases where the table name is within a string in the output of the Hive command. We can achieve this by splitting the output and then checking if the table name is in the resulting list of table names. This ensures that we can identify the table accurately and return the correct existence status.

### Corrected Function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_list = stdout.split('\n')
            return table_list and table in table_list
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                                use {0};
                                show partitions {1}
                                partition({2});
                                """.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout and checking if the table name is within the list, we ensure a more accurate check for table existence. Additionally, the corrected version correctly handles the case where the table name might be part of a larger string in the output.
