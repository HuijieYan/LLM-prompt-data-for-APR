## Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic. When checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` response, the function is comparing the entire `stdout` string with just the `table` name, which can cause issues when the `stdout` contains additional information.

The bug can be observed from the failing test cases where the function is returning incorrect results due to the flawed comparison logic. The `table_exists` function is expected to return `True` if the table exists in the `stdout` response, otherwise `False`.

## Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. We should check if the `table` name is contained within each line of the `stdout` response, rather than comparing the whole `stdout` string directly to the `table`. This approach will accurately verify the existence of the table in the Hive database.

## Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))` to search for the `table` within each line of the `stdout` response. This change ensures that the function accurately determines if the `table` exists in the Hive database.

After applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should pass all the failing test cases provided.
