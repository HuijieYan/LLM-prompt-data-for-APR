The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic of checking the presence of the table/partition in the `stdout` variable. The current implementation does not handle the cases where the table/partition name is part of a larger string in `stdout`. The buggy function only checks if the table/partition name exists in the entirety of `stdout`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to ensure that the table/partition name is a separate word in the `stdout` string, not part of another word. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` string into lines and then checking if the table/partition name exists in any line individually.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(line.strip() == self.partition_spec(partition) for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string into lines using `split('\n')` and then iterates over each line to check if the table/partition name is equal to that line after stripping any extra whitespace. This approach ensures that we accurately detect the presence of the table/partition in the `stdout` output.

This correction should resolve the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values provided.
