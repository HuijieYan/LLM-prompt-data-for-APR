Based on the analysis provided, we can determine that the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect comparison being performed on the `stdout` variable.

The current implementation checks if `stdout` is not empty by evaluating `stdout and table in stdout`, which is problematic because the condition will be `True` even when `table` is a substring of `stdout` rather than an exact match as intended. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases where `table` is present as part of a larger string in `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to ensure that `table` is an exact match in `stdout`. We can use the `splitlines()` method on the `stdout` string to split it into lines and then check each line for an exact match with `table`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Simplified version, considering that presence of stdout is enough for True
```

This corrected version dissects the `stdout` string into lines and checks each line individually for an exact match with the `table` name. This ensures that we are only returning `True` when the `table` name is found as a separate line in the `stdout`.

Please verify this corrected version with the failing tests provided to ensure it passes all the cases and meets the expected input/output values.
