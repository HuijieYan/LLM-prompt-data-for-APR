## Bug Fixing Strategy
Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue seems to be with the comparison of the output `stdout` to determine if a table or partition exists. The current implementation does not handle the case where there might be extra characters in the `stdout` output or inconsistencies in the case sensitivity of the table names causing the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to properly handle the comparison of the table names and partitions. We should also ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table names.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().replace('\n', '')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With these modifications, the corrected `table_exists` function now properly handles the comparison of table names and partitions in a case-insensitive manner and should pass all the failing test cases.
