The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the `stdout` variable is checked for confirmation of table existence. The function checks if the table name is directly present in the output without considering the formatting of the output, leading to incorrect results. This is evident from the failing test cases where the function fails to correctly identify the presence of the table name due to the formatting of the output.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the stdout format to ensure accurate detection of table existence. We can split the stdout lines and then check if the table name appears on any line.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split())
```

With this correction, the function now splits the stdout into lines and checks if the table name is present in any of the lines, ensuring proper handling of table existence confirmation based on the stdout format. This modification should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
