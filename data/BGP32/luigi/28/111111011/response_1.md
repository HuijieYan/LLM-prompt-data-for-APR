### Error Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue where the comparison between the table name and the tables shown in the stdout isn't case-insensitive. The function currently directly compares the table name with the stdout without considering case differences, leading to the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when comparing the table name with the tables shown in `stdout`, the comparison is case-sensitive. If the table name is in a different case than what is returned by `stdout`, the comparison fails, leading to the test failures.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the entries in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and the entries in `stdout` are converted to lowercase when being compared, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This change addresses the case sensitivity issue and should make the `table_exists` function work as expected.

After applying this fix, the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues should pass, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
