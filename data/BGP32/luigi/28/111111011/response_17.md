## Corrections and Explanations

### Problem Identification
The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails the test cases due to case sensitivity. The function compares the table names retrieved from Hive with the input table name without considering case differences. Since Hive is case insensitive, this leads to test failures when table names have different case variations.

### Cause of the Bug
1. The function compares the `stdout` (output from Hive) directly with the input table name, without considering case differences.
2. When the `table` parameter has a different case than the actual table name saved in Hive, the comparison fails, leading to the error.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in `table_exists()` to make it case insensitive. By converting both the table name from Hive (`stdout`) and the input table name to lowercase, we can perform the comparison without being affected by case sensitivity.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation
1. In the fixed version, both the `stdout` and the `table` parameters are converted to lowercase before comparing them.
2. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue highlighted in the failing tests and GitHub discussions.

By making this change, the `table_exists()` function becomes case insensitive, allowing it to correctly handle table name comparisons in Hive queries.
