After analyzing the buggy function, related test code, error messages, and runtime values, it is evident that the bug lies in the case sensitivity of comparing the table names. The issue reported on GitHub also confirms this problem, suggesting a solution to make the comparison case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison inside the `table_exists` function to ensure a case-insensitive check between the `table` name and the `stdout`. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This modified version converts both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This adjustment ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the reported bug.

By implementing this fix, the failing test cases should now pass without any assertion errors.
