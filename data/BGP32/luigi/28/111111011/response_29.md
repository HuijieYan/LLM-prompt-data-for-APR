### Analyzing the Bug
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` is verifying the behavior of the `table_exists` function in different scenarios, including case sensitivity.
3. The error message shows that the assertion for `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing because the function does not handle case sensitivity, causing the test to expect `True` but receiving `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive to avoid issues with table names in different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to handle the case insensitivity in Hive table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now properly handles case sensitivity for Hive table names. This modification resolves the failing test cases related to case sensitivity.
