The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name from the stdout with the provided table name. The issue on GitHub highlights this problem and suggests making the comparison case-insensitive.

### Bug Explanation:
When the `table_exists` function is called with a table name, it retrieves the table information from Hive and compares it with the provided table name. The comparison is case-sensitive, causing tests to fail when the table names have different cases. The error message indicates the assertion failure when comparing the expected value with the actual returned value.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison operation to be case-insensitive. By converting both the retrieved table name and the provided table name to lowercase, we can ensure a successful comparison regardless of the case.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with a case-insensitive comparison:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` in the comparison, we ensure that the table name matching is not sensitive to the letter case.

This correction should address the bug and allow the `table_exists` function to pass the failing tests related to case sensitivity.
