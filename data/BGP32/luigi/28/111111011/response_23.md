## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a given table exists in Hive based on the output of `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises when the table name case does not match the case of the output from Hive, leading to a case-sensitive check that causes test failures.
2. The function inaccurately compares the table name directly to the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug occurs when the given table name has a different case from what is returned by Hive, leading to the function incorrectly determining the table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for the existence.
  

## Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

``` 

In the fixed version:
- The function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing for existence.
- This ensures a case-insensitive check when determining if the table exists in Hive.
- The return statements have been simplified by directly returning boolean results based on the stdout existence.

This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
