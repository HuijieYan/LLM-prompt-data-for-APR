### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue described in the GitHub reports the same problem and suggests making the comparison case insensitive.
2. The function incorrectly compares the `table` parameter with the `stdout` without considering the case.
3. The failing tests clearly show that the function fails when dealing with different cases for table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` case insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function will address this issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the function case insensitive. This fixes the bug and ensures that the function passes the failing tests.
