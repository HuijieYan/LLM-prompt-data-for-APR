## Fixing the Bug

### Analyzing the Bug
The bug occurs when the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class from `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is called with table names that have different cases. The function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from how the function compares the table name in the returned `stdout` from the Hive command. Since the comparison is case-sensitive, when the table names have different cases, the comparisons fail, resulting in incorrect test outcomes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, we can ensure that case differences do not affect the comparison result.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Converted both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method.
2. Simplified the condition for returning the result when `stdout` is not empty.

By making these changes, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing tests.

### Note:
Make sure to replace the existing implementation of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class with the corrected version provided above.
