To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity in comparing the table names. The current implementation directly checks if the table name is in the `stdout` output, which leads to failing tests due to case differences between the table name and the `stdout`.

To resolve this issue as per the mentioned GitHub issue, we should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive and should now pass the failing tests provided for the function. This change aligns with the proposal in the GitHub issue and should resolve the case sensitivity issue in the function.
