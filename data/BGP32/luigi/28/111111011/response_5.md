### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test due to case-sensitivity issues when comparing the table name in lowercase with the table names fetched from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a Hive database by querying it and then checking if the table name is in the output fetched from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The issue arises because the comparison between the table name and the table names fetched from `run_hive_cmd` is case-sensitive. This causes the test to fail when table names are in different cases.
4. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the values fetched from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Make comparison case-insensitive
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the values fetched from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, the function `table_exists` will now be case-insensitive and pass the failing test cases. This fix aligns with the GitHub issues raised for the bug.
