## The analysis of the buggy function
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check whether a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. The issue arises when comparing the table name from the command output to the input table name without considering case sensitivity.

The failing tests indicate that the function fails when attempting to check for the existence of tables with different casing. The tests expect the function to be case insensitive when comparing table names.

## Identifying the bug
The bug arises from not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name retrieved from the Hive command output to the input table name.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command needs to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase using `lower()` before comparison to make the comparison case insensitive.
- The `partition_str` is generated outside the `run_hive_cmd` call to prevent potential issues.

By making this change, the function will now correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of the case sensitivity of the input table name.
