The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to account for tables defined with capitalized names. 

To fix this bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This approach ensures that the check is case-insensitive and aligns with the issue raised in GitHub.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By employing the `lower()` method on both the table name `table` and `stdout`, we can ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This adjustment addresses the reported failing test cases and aligns with the GitHub issue raised for this bug.

After applying this fix, re-run the failing test cases to confirm that the corrected function now behaves as expected.
