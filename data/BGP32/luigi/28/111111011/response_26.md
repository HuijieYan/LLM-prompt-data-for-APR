### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
2. The problem occurs when the function is called with a table name that has a different case than what is returned by Hive's `show tables` command, leading to test failures.
3. The failing test case tries to check table existence with different cases but fails due to the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
4. The bug is outlined in GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking the stdout against the lowercased table name.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to consider case insensitivity when comparing the table names.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

### Correction Explanation:
1. In the `table_exists` function, changed the comparison of table name in the stdout to be case insensitive by converting both names to lowercase.
2. By comparing the lowercase version of the table name and the stdout, the function now handles case sensitivity issues correctly.
3. The condition `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that the function checks for table existence regardless of the case.

By applying the provided bug fix, the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity correctly, resolving the failing test cases related to table existence checks.
