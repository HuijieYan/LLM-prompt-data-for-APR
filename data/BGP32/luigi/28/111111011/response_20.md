To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

    if stdout:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase during comparison, we ensure that case sensitivity does not affect the result of the function. This modification aligns with the proposed fix in GitHub issues #896 and the related description provided.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub discussion.
