## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive` fails the test cases due to case sensitivity in checking table names. The function compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner with the stdout received from Hive, leading to failures when there are differences in case.

## Bug Explanation
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class compares the table name directly with the stdout from Hive without considering case sensitivity.
- When the table name has different case variations between what is passed to the function and what is returned by Hive, the comparison fails.
- Due to this behavior, the test cases that involve checking table existence with different letter cases fail due to case sensitivity issues.

## Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.
- By doing so, we ensure that the comparison ignores the case difference and correctly identifies table existence irrespective of the case of the table names.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function `table_exists` is case-insensitive and correctly identifies table existence in a case-independent manner. This correction will address the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
