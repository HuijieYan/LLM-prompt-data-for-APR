## Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing table names. The function needs to be modified to perform case-insensitive comparisons to match the behavior of Hive, which is case-insensitive when it comes to table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The correction involves converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison to ensure case-insensitive matching.

By making this change, the function will now handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly, addressing the failing tests related to case sensitivity.

This correction aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue (#896) that suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive.
