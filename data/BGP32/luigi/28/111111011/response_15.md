To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be made case-insensitive. This adjustment will address the failing test cases where the actual table name in `stdout` might be in a different case compared to the provided table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Fixing the bug in the table_exists function to make the comparison case-insensitive
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction ensures that both the table name provided and the table names in the output `stdout` are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests, resolving the issue reported on GitHub (#896).
