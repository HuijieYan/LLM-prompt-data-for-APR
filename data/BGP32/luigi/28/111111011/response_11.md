## Analysis

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive. The issue arises when the function compares the table name in the output `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

2. The failing test cases clearly show that the function is failing when checking for table existence due to a case sensitivity mismatch in table names.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name directly with the content of `stdout`, which may be in a different case. This leads to false assertion failures in the test cases due to case-insensitive comparisons not being handled.

4. To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should convert both the table name and the `stdout` content to lowercase or uppercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.

## Bug Fix

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase in the comparison, the function now supports case-insensitive checks for table existence, resolving the bug reported in the failing test cases.
