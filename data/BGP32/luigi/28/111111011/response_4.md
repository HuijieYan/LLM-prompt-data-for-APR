### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specific database. The bug appears to be related to case sensitivity in table name comparison.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks the output for table existence.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing the tests to fail when checking for tables with different letter cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the table name comparison case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
   
### Updated Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
- The updated code modifies the `table_exists` function to make the comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive output case insensitive.
- By converting both table names to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()`, we ensure that the comparison is consistent regardless of case.
- The function now returns `True` if the table exists (case insensitive match found) and `False` otherwise, ensuring the tests pass.

By making these changes, the function should now handle case sensitivity issues in table existence checks.
