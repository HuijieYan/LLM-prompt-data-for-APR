The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class needs to be fixed to make the comparison case-insensitive. The issue arises because the function currently performs a case-sensitive string comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which can cause the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases.

To fix the bug:
- Change the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive for table names.
