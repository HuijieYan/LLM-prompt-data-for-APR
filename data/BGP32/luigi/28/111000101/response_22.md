### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` checks if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
2. The function has two branches based on whether a `partition` is provided or not.
3. The bug is likely in the second branch where the Hive command is formed using the `self.partition_spec(partition)` method. The method `partition_spec` seems to generate the partition spec incorrectly.
4. Since the second branch is faulty, we need to ensure that the Hive command is correctly formed in both branches.
5. The buggy function returns a boolean value based on the presence of the table in the stdout.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the else branch of the `table_exists` function when a `partition` is provided. The bug originates from the incorrect formation of the Hive command by calling `self.partition_spec(partition)`. The `partition_spec` method is expected to return a valid partition specification, but it seems to be generating incorrect or incomplete specifications.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Inspect the `partition_spec` method to ensure it correctly generates the partition specification.
2. Update the buggy function to correctly form the Hive command using the return value of the `partition_spec` method.
3. Ensure that the Hive command template used is correct and considers the database, table, and partition information provided.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected function uses the `partition` dictionary to construct the correct partition specification before forming the Hive command in the else branch. It ensures that the generated Hive command is valid and properly checks for the existence of the table based on the output.
