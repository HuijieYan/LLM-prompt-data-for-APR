### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. The issue lies in how the command is constructed for the case where a partition is specified. The code attempts to use the `partition_spec` method to provide the partition details in the Hive command, but it is not implemented correctly. As a result, the Hive command is not formed as expected, leading to failures in identifying the tables with partitions.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` method in constructing the Hive command when a partition is specified. Since the `partition_spec` method doesn't return the partition details in a format that can be directly used in the Hive command, the command ends up being malformed or incomplete, leading to incorrect results when checking for the table's existence with the specified partition.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the partitions are correctly formatted and included in the Hive command when checking for table existence with partitions. This can be achieved by modifying the way partition information is retrieved and combined in the Hive command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Generate the partition string based on the provided dictionary
        partition_string = ','.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        
        # Use the correct format to include partition in the Hive command
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s.%s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, database, table, partition_string))

        return bool(stdout)  # Ensure the result is boolean
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly formatting the partition details and then including them in the Hive command when checking for table existence with partitions. It should now correctly handle cases where partitions are specified and check for the existence of the table accordingly.
