### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table (or partition of a table) exists in a Hive database.
2. The function uses another function `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and obtain the output.
3. There are two branches in the function:
    - When `partition` is `None`, it constructs a Hive command to show tables and checks if the specified table exists.
    - When `partition` is not `None`, it constructs a Hive command to show partitions of a table and checks if the specified partition exists.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the Hive commands are constructed and the check for stdout value.

### Bug Explanation
- In the first branch of the function, the bug may occur if the `stdout` is not populated correctly when running the Hive command to show tables. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not work as expected if `stdout` is empty or does not contain the table name.
- In the second branch of the function, the bug may occur if the `stdout` is not populated correctly when running the Hive command to show partitions. The condition `if stdout` may not accurately reflect whether the partition exists or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the Hive commands are correctly constructed to show tables or partitions.
2. Validate the `stdout` output to ensure it contains the necessary information about tables/partitions.
3. Adjust the conditions to accurately determine the existence of the table/partition based on the `stdout` output.

### Corrected Version
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    process = Popen(['hive', '-e', hivecmd], stdout=PIPE)
    output, _ = process.communicate()
    if check_return_code and process.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception(f"Hive command failed: {hivecmd}")
    return output.decode('utf-8')

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation not shown

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_clause = ' AND '.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition({partition_clause})')
            return partition_clause in stdout
```

This corrected version:
- Uses `subprocess.Popen()` to execute Hive commands and capture the stdout.
- Constructs the Hive commands using `f-strings` for better readability.
- Checks the existence of the table/partition by directly comparing the table name or partition clause in the stdout.
