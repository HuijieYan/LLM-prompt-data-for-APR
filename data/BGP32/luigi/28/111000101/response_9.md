The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in a given Hive database. The bug lies in the way the SQL queries are being constructed and executed. The function fails to correctly handle the case when a table is not found or when partitions are involved.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the SQL queries formed in the function. Additionally, we should handle the case when no output is received from the command run by `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partitions});')
        return bool(stdout)  # if stdout is not empty, table exists
```

This corrected version ensures that the SQL queries are correctly constructed, and it correctly handles the case when no output is received. This version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values provided.
