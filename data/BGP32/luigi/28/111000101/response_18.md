### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table or a partition in a Hive database. The bug arises from how the function constructs and executes the Hive commands. In particular, when checking for the existence of a table with a specific name, the buggy function uses the Hive command `show tables like "{1}"` where it should be `show tables like '{1}'`. Similarly, when checking for the existence of a partition, the command is constructed incorrectly with missing quotes around `{table}` causing potential issues.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the formatting of the Hive commands in the `run_hive_cmd` function. The inconsistency in string formatting causes the commands to be constructed incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive commands are constructed correctly with the appropriate formatting for strings. Specifically, we need to use single quotes for table names in the commands. Additionally, when constructing the command to check partition existence, we need to ensure that the `table` variable is enclosed in single quotes as well.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables like '{1}';".format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition ('%s')""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making these corrections to the command construction, the function should now correctly check for the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive database.
