### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database. It calls the function `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive queries.
2. The first part of the `if` condition checks if the `partition` is `None` and executes a Hive query to check for the existence of the table.
3. The second part of the `if` condition executes a Hive query for a table with partitions using the `partition_spec` method.
4. The bug is that the function is not properly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determining if the table exists based on that output.

### Bug
The bug is in how the function is handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function simply checks if `stdout` is truthy or falsy, but it does not correctly parse the output to determine if the table exists.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists. We should compare the expected table name with the lines in the `stdout` variable to check for its existence.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Check if the table is in the results
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});"
            )
            # Split the stdout by line and check if the partition is present
            return any(f'partition({partition})' in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
``` 

In the corrected version, we properly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check if the table or partition exists based on the parsed output.
