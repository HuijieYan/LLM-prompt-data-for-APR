### Analyzing the buggy function

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table (or a partition of a table) exists in a given database by running a Hive command. The function takes in the table name, the database name, and an optional partition parameter. The bug seems to be related to the way the Hive commands are constructed and executed within the function.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The condition to check if a table exists without a partition is missing the correct logic for parsing the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The construction of the Hive command when checking for the existence of a table with a partition might have issues due to improper formatting of the command or incorrect handling of the `self.partition_spec` function.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

- In the first part of the `if` block for the case of checking table existence without a partition, the return statement is checking `stdout and table in stdout`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where `stdout` might contain other values along with the table name.
- In the second part of the `if` block for the case of checking table existence with a partition, the construction of the Hive command might not follow the correct syntax or handle the partition specification correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly parse the output of the Hive commands to accurately determine if a table exists.
2. Ensure that the Hive commands are constructed correctly, especially when dealing with table partitions and the `self.partition_spec` function.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            hive_command = 'use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});'.format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(hive_command)
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the stdout by newline character when checking for the existence of a table without a partition.
- We construct the Hive command for checking table existence with a partition by properly formatting the partition specification using `partition_str` and including it in the command. Additionally, we return a boolean value based on if the stdout was not empty.

This corrected version should now handle the expected input/output scenarios provided.
