### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is trying to determine if a specific table exists in a database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The issue lies in the construction of the Hive command in the `else` block when a partition is provided. The call to `run_hive_cmd` is incorrect because it's not forming the correct syntax for showing partitions. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists, and `False` otherwise.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, when a partition is provided, the call to `run_hive_cmd` to check if the table exists is incorrect. The Hive command string being constructed does not match the correct syntax for showing partitions. This leads to incorrect results when trying to validate the existence of a table with a partition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the construction of the Hive command string in the `else` block when a partition is provided. The Hive command needs to be formed correctly to check for partitions related to the given table and database.

### Corrected Code

```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}=\'{}\''.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the function fixes the Hive command construction when a partition is provided. It correctly formats the partition details and constructs the Hive query string to check if the specified table with the given partition exists.
