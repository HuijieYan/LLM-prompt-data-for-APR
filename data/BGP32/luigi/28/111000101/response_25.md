### Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expecting to check whether a table (potentially with partitions) exists in the specified database. The bug lies in the construction of the SQL queries for both cases. In the first case, the `show tables` query is not correctly formatted, and in the second case, the `show partitions` query is missing a necessary component.

### Bug
1. In the first case, the query `show tables like "{1}"` is not correctly formed.
2. In the second case, the `show partitions` query is missing the actual partition values.

### Fix Strategy
1. For the first case, construct the `show tables` query correctly to find the specified table.
2. For the second case, ensure that the partition values are included in the `show partitions` query.

### Updated Code
```python
# The buggy function has been corrected
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec_str = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});""".format(database, database, table, partition_spec_str))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

The corrected code includes fixing the SQL queries for both cases, ensuring proper syntax and adding partition values where necessary. Now the function should behave as expected for all the provided cases.
