### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a specified database with an optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. In the case of no partition, it runs a command to show tables. In the case of a partition, it constructs a command to show partitions using the `partition_spec` method.

The bug in the code lies in the logic of checking the `stdout` variable to determine if a table exists or not. The `stdout` variable is not being properly checked.

### Bug Explanation
In the `table_exists` function:
1. For the case where `partition` is `None`, the code checks if `table` is in `stdout`, which is incorrect. The correct check should be based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. For the case with a specified `partition`, the function constructs a command to show partitions but only checks if the `stdout` is not empty, which is not sufficient to determine if the table exists with the given partition setup.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function directly to determine if the table exists or not, instead of checking the `stdout` variable.
2. In the case with a specified partition, ensure that the constructed partition command is executed properly.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return "OK" in stdout
    else:
        partition_command = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(partition_command)
        
        return "OK" in stdout
``` 

In the corrected version:
- For the case where `partition` is `None`, it checks if `"OK"` is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function directly to determine if the table exists.
- For the case with a specified `partition`, it constructs the complete partition command including the `partition_spec` and checks if `"OK"` is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
