Based on the buggy function provided, there are potential errors in the `table_exists` function's logic. The main issue lies in the conditional `return stdout`, as it does not check for None specifically, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
In the buggy function `table_exists`, the issue arises when checking the `stdout` variable for truthiness. If the `stdout` variable is an empty string, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` will evaluate to False, even though the table does exist in the database. This can lead to incorrect results and falsely returning that the table does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should explicitly check for None when evaluating the truthiness of the `stdout` variable. This way, we ensure that an empty `stdout` string does not lead to a false negative result for table existence.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

By making this adjustment and checking `stdout is not None` in the return statements, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table in all scenarios.
