### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and fetch the standard output for validation.

The bug appears to be in the branching logic of the function. When a partition is provided, the function constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of the partition, not the table itself. This causes the function to always return `False` when a partition is specified, regardless of the actual existence of the table.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs when a `partition` parameter is provided. In this scenario, the function constructs a Hive command using the `show partitions` command, which checks for partitions within a table, not the existence of the table itself. This leads to incorrect results being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the function when a partition is provided. Instead of checking for partitions, we should construct a command to check for the existence of the table itself in the specified database.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Check for the existence of the table, not the partition
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show tables like "{1}";""".format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

In the corrected version, we amend the condition checking the existence of the table within the specified database for both cases, whether a partition is provided or not. This way, the function will correctly determine if the table exists irrespective of the partition.
