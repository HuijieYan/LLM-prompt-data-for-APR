### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database. If a partition is provided, it uses `run_hive_cmd` to show partitions specific to the table and checks if the result is not empty. If no partition is provided, it uses `run_hive_cmd` to show tables matching the given table name and checks if the result contains the table name.

However, the bug lies in how the function handles the stdout variable. It checks for truthiness (`stdout`) which can be incorrect as the `run_hive_cmd` function might return non-empty strings that are not the actual table names/partitions.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the `stdout` string returned by `run_hive_cmd` includes multiple results (e.g., multiple tables or partitions), making the truthiness check unreliable. The function checks if the table name is in the string directly, which might lead to false positives or negatives.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to parse the `stdout` string correctly, for example, by splitting it based on lines and then checking if the exact table name or partition is present in the list of lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(p.strip() == self.partition_spec(partition) for p in partitions)
``` 

This corrected version splits the stdout by lines and then checks for an exact match of the table or partition name in the list.
