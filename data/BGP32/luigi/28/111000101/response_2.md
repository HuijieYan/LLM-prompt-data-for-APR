### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. If a `partition` is provided, it calls `self.partition_spec(partition)` to get the partition specification. However, there are some issues with how the Hive commands are constructed and executed, which leads to incorrect checks for table existence.

### Bug
The bug arises from the way the Hive commands are constructed and executed within the `table_exists` function. When checking for table existence, the function should be looking at the output `stdout` to determine if the table exists. However, the constructed Hive command queries for tables/partitions but does not properly parse the output to check for existence. This results in incorrect returns when checking for the existence of a table.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the Hive commands used to properly check for table existence. The corrected version should parse the output of the Hive commands and check if the table exists based on that output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables in `{database}` like "{table}"')

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} ({partitions})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version above, the Hive commands have been structured to use `show tables in <database>` and `show partitions <table> (<partitions>)` to correctly check for table existence with or without partitions. The output of the Hive command is then parsed correctly to determine if the table exists.
