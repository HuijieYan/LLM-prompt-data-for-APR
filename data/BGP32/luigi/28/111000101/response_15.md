### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a specified database, potentially with a specific partition. The bug lies in the conditional statements where the function checks the stdout value. In the first condition, `table in stdout` is used directly without checking for the presence of the table name in the stdout string. In the second condition, the `if stdout:` check does not accurately determine the existence of the table in the database.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first condition (`if partition is None`), `table in stdout` is used. This condition will not work correctly because it directly checks if the `table` string is present in the `stdout` string, which may lead to false positives.
2. In the second condition (when `partition` is not None), `if stdout:` is used to check if stdout has any content. However, the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function may not necessarily indicate the existence of the table, leading to inaccurate results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. In the first condition, extract the table names from the `stdout` and then check if the `table` matches any of the extracted names.
2. In the second condition, revise the logic to accurately determine if the table exists based on the contents of `stdout`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in table_list
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version first splits the `stdout` string by newline characters to extract individual table names in the first condition. In the second condition, it constructs the partition string and accurately checks if `stdout` has content to confirm the table's existence.
