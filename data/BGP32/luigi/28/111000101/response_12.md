### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table or a partition exists in a database by running a Hive command. The bug seems to be related to how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called within the `table_exists` function.

### Bug in the Code
1. In the `table_exists` function, when a partition is given, the formatting of the Hive command string is incorrect. The `self.partition_spec(partition)` call is not being incorporated correctly into the Hive command string.
2. The condition to check the existence of a table based on the output of the Hive command might not work as expected due to issues with string comparison.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug occurs because the formatting of the Hive command string in the `table_exists` function when a partition is given is incorrect. This causes the Hive command to be malformed and fail to return the expected output.
2. The bug in the string comparison within the conditions may not accurately determine if the table/partition exists based on the command output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the string formatting in the Hive command to correctly include the partition specification.
2. Modify the condition for checking table existence to handle the output of the Hive command accurately.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partitions})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with string formatting and the condition for checking table existence. Now, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with the correct Hive command string including the partition specification. The condition for checking table existence has been simplified to return `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table or partition exists.
