### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. If a partition is provided, it should check if the partition exists as well. The bug seems to be in the conditionals used to return whether the table or partition exists. It is currently returning a boolean value based on the truthiness of `stdout`.

### Bug
The bug lies in the conditionals `return stdout and table in stdout` and `if stdout: return True`. These conditionals are checking the truthiness of `stdout`, which may not always be an accurate representation of whether the table or partition exists. Additionally, the query results may contain extra information which could lead to false negatives.

### Fix
A more robust way to fix this bug is to check if the table or partition name is explicitly present in the output received from the Hive command. This will ensure accuracy in determining the existence of the table or partition.

### Updated Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_spec_string = ', '.join(['%s=%s' % (key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec_string))
        return partition_spec_string in stdout
```
