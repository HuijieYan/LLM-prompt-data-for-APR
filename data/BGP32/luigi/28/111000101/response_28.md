### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The function utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute commands against Hive.
3. There are two branches in the function based on whether a partition is provided or not.
4. The output of the function relies on the presence of the table in the stdout result from the Hive commands.
5. The bug likely arises from how the function handles the stdout and its comparison with the table name.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the function is checking the presence of a table in the `stdout` of the Hive command execution. In both branches of the code, the function checks if the `table` string is present in the `stdout`. However, the comparison is based on whether the `table` is a substring in `stdout`, which can lead to incorrect results if the name is part of another word.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` name is matched exactly in the `stdout`. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` into lines and then checking each line for an exact match with the `table` name.

### Corrected Version
```python
from io import StringIO

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_lines = StringIO(stdout).readlines()
        return any(line.strip() == table for line in table_lines)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        table_lines = StringIO(stdout).readlines()
        return any(line.strip() == table for line in table_lines)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `table` name is exactly matched in each line of the `stdout` output from the Hive commands, avoiding incorrect results due to substring matches.
