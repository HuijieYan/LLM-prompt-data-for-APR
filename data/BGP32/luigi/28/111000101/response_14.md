### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is meant to check for the existence of a table in a database. It utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` functions. The bug in the function seems to be related to the condition checks and the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being utilized.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first part of the function (when `partition` is `None`), it runs a command to check if a table exists in the specified database. However, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not sufficient because it only checks if `table` is present in the output. This check can be faulty if the output contains other tables along with `table`.
  
2. In the second part of the function (when `partition` is not `None`), it constructs a command using database, table, and the result of a call to `self.partition_spec(partition)`. The result of this command is not checked properly; it only returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty. This means that it only checks if the command executed successfully, not if a valid partition was found.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the check in the first part to ensure that the exact table name exists in the output.
2. Check the actual output in the second part to see if the specified partition exists.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and partition in stdout.strip().split('\n')
```

### Explanation of Correction
1. In the first part, the check has been updated to `return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')`. This split ensures that each table name is checked independently, improving the accuracy of the check.
2. In the second part, the check is updated to `return stdout and partition in stdout.strip().split('\n')`. Here, it checks if the specified partition is present in the output.

By implementing these changes, the function should now accurately determine the existence of the table and partition in the specified database.
