### Fixing the Bug

#### Identified Issue:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the case when `stdout` contains the table name being checked for existence. It is currently returning the boolean evaluation of whether `table` is in `stdout`, but it should be checking for an exact match instead.

#### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Modify the checking condition to verify if the table name is exactly equal to the table in `stdout`.
2. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Modify condition to check for exact match
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)  # Cast the stdout to boolean directly

``` 

Applying the fixes as described above would correct the buggy function `table_exists` and make it satisfy all the expected input/output values.
