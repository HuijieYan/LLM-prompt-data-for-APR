### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database either with or without a specified partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
3. There are two conditional branches in the function checking for the presence of the `partition` parameter to determine whether to include a `show partitions` command.
4. The bug is likely related to how the `stdout` variable is handled in the function, specifically with the conditionals checking its value.

### Bug:
The bug in the original code lies in how the function handles the `stdout` variable after executing the Hive command. In the first conditional branch, the function incorrectly checks if `stdout` is a truthy value, which may not always indicate a successful table exists check. Similarly, in the second conditional branch, even if `stdout` contains partition information, the function does not properly parse it to determine if the table exists.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the `stdout` variable based on the expected values and types of variables for each test case. We should parse the output of the Hive command properly and check it against the expected table name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return any(table in part for part in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then iterating through each line to accurately check for the existence of the table, we address the original bug in the function. This corrected version should satisfy all the expected test cases provided.
