### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by running specific Hive commands.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the `stdout` variable after running the Hive commands.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition for returning `True`. In the first case, the function always returns `False` regardless of the table existence due to the check `return stdout and table in stdout`, which is not handling the case properly. In the second case, when a table exists, the function is expected to return `True`, but it might not be doing so correctly due to how the `stdout` variable is checked.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks the `stdout` variable to determine the existence of the table. We should modify the conditions for returning `True` or `False` based on the content of `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return "OK" in stdout  # Check if "OK" is in stdout to verify table existence
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Returning the boolean value directly from the stdout check
```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly determine if a table exists in the given database based on the `stdout` output from the Hive commands.
