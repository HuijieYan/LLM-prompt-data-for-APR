### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database in Hive. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the output of the Hive command. In the current implementation, the function checks if the table name is present in the entire output string which can lead to false positives.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function checks if the table name exists in the entire output string returned by the Hive command. This can lead to incorrect results if the table name is a substring of another table's name in the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to check if the table name is a standalone word in the output. One way to do this is by splitting the output into lines and then searching for the table name in each line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly check if the table name is a standalone word in the list of tables returned by the Hive command, ensuring more accurate results and passing the failing tests.
