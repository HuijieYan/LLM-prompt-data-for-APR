### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely in the condition check of `stdout and table in stdout`. In the failing tests, the function is not handling the table existence check correctly, leading to failing assertions.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check to properly handle the `stdout` output for table existence. We can modify the function to return `True` if the table name is found in the `stdout`, indicating that the table exists.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly check for the existence of a table in the Hive database and return `True` if the table is found in the `stdout`, fixing the bug causing the failing tests.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests provided.
