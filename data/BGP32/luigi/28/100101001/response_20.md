### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is not correctly checking for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is returning `True` if any output is present, regardless of whether the table actually exists in that output.

### Bug:
The bug lies in how the function checks for the table existence in the `stdout` variable. It simply checks if `stdout` has any value, which leads to incorrect results.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to correctly check if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. We should only return `True` if the exact table name is found in the output, otherwise `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable and checking if the `table` name is in the output list, we can accurately determine if the table exists in the database. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
