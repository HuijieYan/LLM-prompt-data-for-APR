### Error Location:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the condition checks related to the `stdout` variable. In the first part of the function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` should check if the table name exists within the `stdout`, but it is only checking if `stdout` has some value. This leads to incorrect results. Similarly, in the second part of the function, the condition `if stdout` is always True because even an empty string would evaluate to True in a boolean context.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function should return `False` because the table does not exist, but the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` doesn't accurately verify this.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the function should return `True` because the table exists, but the condition fails to properly evaluate this due to the way `stdout` is checked.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions for checking if a table exists in the `stdout` of the Hive command output. We should correctly validate if the table name is present in the `stdout` string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

With these changes, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine if a table exists based on the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output of the Hive command.
