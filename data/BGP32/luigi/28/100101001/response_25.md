The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking if the table exists is incorrect. The function checks if the stdout is not empty and if the table name is in stdout, which is not the correct approach.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the table name is present in the output of the Hive command.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly check if the table exists in the Hive database. This should ensure that the failing test cases pass successfully.
