### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. In the `if` condition where it checks `return stdout and table in stdout`, the logic might not be handling the case where `table` is in a newline-separated string like `'OK\nmytable'`.
2. In the `if` condition where it checks `return True` if `stdout` exists, it might not be correctly handling the presence of newline characters in the `stdout` string.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the way the function is handling the `stdout` string returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. When the `stdout` contains multiple lines, the function is not correctly parsing the table name to check its existence.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the `stdout` string to check for the existence of the table. We can modify the code to split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the `table` name exists in any of the lines.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

By splitting the `stdout` string by newline characters and checking the existence of the `table` name in each line, we can ensure that the function correctly determines if the table exists.
