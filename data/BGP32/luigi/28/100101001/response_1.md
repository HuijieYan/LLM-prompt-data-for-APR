### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable in the function. The function is checking if the `stdout` variable is a non-empty string instead of properly parsing the expected table names from it.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the test expects the function to return `False` as the table "mytable" is not found in the `stdout` variable, which contains only "OK".
   
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the test expects the function to return `True` as the table "MyTable" is found in the `stdout` variable, which contains "OK\nmytable".

3. The function wrongly interprets the presence of any non-empty `stdout` as an indication of the existence of the table, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the table names from the `stdout` variable and check if the desired table is present in it.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By correctly splitting the `stdout` variable by `\n` and checking if the table name is present among the parsed table names, the corrected function now handles the table existence checks properly.
