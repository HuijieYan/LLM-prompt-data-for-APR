### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly checking if a table exists in a database. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout`. The function is not handling the case where the table name is part of a larger string in the `stdout`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the way the function checks if the table exists based on the `stdout` value. The function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`, but it does not handle cases where the `table` name is part of a larger string in the `stdout`, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `table` name appears as a separate word in the `stdout` string. We can split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the `table` name appears in any of the resulting lines.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(row.strip() == table for row in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By using the corrected function provided above, the function will correctly check if the table exists in the database based on the output of the hive command, irrespective of how the `table` name is presented in the `stdout` string. 

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
