The root cause of the bug is in the conditional checks inside the `table_exists` function. The function is not correctly evaluating whether the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The bug occurs when the function checks the presence of the table in the output, resulting in incorrect evaluation.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to compare the table name correctly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. We should ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive to address the failing test cases that involve different casing of table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The changes made include converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. The function now correctly evaluates the presence of the table in the given database.

After implementing these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases provided.
