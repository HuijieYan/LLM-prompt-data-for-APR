### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and optional partition. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

In the first part of the function, when `partition` is None, the function checks if the `table` is in the output of the `show tables` command. In the second part, when `partition` is provided, the function tries to check if the partition exists in the table.

Based on the provided runtime values and the failing test cases, it seems that the function incorrectly handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In both cases where `stdout` contains the table name, the function fails to identify that the table exists and returns False.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, especially when it contains the table name. We should also consider converting the output to lowercase for case insensitivity, as indicated in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase for case insensitivity comparisons.
- We directly return the boolean value of `stdout` for the second part of the function, as it is already a truthy value when the partition exists.
