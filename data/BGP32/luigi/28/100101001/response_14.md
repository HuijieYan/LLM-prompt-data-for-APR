The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition when checking if the table exists based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation only checks for the presence of the table name in the output, which leads to incorrect results when the table name is a substring of another table name.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check for exact matches of the table name in the output. Additionally, we need to handle the case insensitivity of table names as indicated in the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version checks for an exact match of the table name in the output by splitting the lines and converting them to lowercase for comparison. Additionally, it handles the case insensitivity by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases.
