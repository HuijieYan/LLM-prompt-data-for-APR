### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine the existence of the table.
2. The bug seems to be related to the conditional checking and evaluation of the `stdout` variable after running the Hive command.
3. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function returns the result based on whether the table is in the stdout output. However, the conditions don't correctly handle cases where multiple tables are returned in the stdout.
4. The bug occurs because the function only checks if the exact table name exists in the stdout, leading to incorrect results when multiple tables are present in the output.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table name is in the list of tables extracted from the stdout, rather than an exact match.

### Bug Fix
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split()

        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the stdout on whitespace to get a list of table names in the database and then checking if the table name exists in that list, we can accurately determine if the table exists. Additionally, we did not modify the `else` section as it deals with partitions, which are not related to the bug identified in the test cases.
