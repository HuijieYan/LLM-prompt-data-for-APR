### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might not be handling the case where `table` is in `stdout` but with different capitalization.
2. The usage of string formatting and concatenation might introduce errors in constructing the Hive query commands.
3. The partition handling in the else block might not be correctly constructing the Hive command for checking partitions.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner, leading to incorrect results when checking if a table exists in the database. Additionally, the concatenation of string commands might lead to syntax errors in the Hive queries.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
1. Modify the condition for checking table existence to handle case-insensitive comparisons.
2. Ensure proper formatting and handling of Hive query commands to prevent syntax errors.
3. Review the partition handling logic to construct the correct Hive command for checking partitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making the table comparisons case-insensitive, fixing any string formatting issues, and correctly constructing the Hive commands for checking partitions, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
