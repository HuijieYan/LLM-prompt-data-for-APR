### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has two branches based on whether the `partition` parameter is provided or not. In both branches, it uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks if the table exists based on the output. However, the bug seems to be related to how the function interprets the output of the Hive command.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the condition used to check if the table exists. In the if branch, the function checks `return stdout and table in stdout`, but this logic is flawed because the presence of the table in the output does not guarantee that the table exists. The same issue is present in the else branch where an empty string is used to check for existence, which is not valid.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to properly verify the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output of the Hive command in the if branch and directly returning the boolean value of stdout in the else branch, we ensure that the table existence check is done correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
