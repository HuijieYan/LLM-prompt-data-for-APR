### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the condition for table existence (`table in stdout`) may not be handled correctly.
2. In the `else` block, the condition checking for the presence of partitions may not be implemented accurately.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the stdout content that results from running the `run_hive_cmd` function in both blocks of the `table_exists` method. The function is not correctly determining the existence of tables based on the output received from the command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly parses the stdout output from the Hive command to determine table existence. We should also ensure that the function handles table case-insensitivity properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        
        return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- In the `if partition is None` block, we split the stdout output by lines and check if any of the tables match the given table in a case-insensitive manner.
- In the `else` block, we return based on the presence of the stdout output as an indicator of partition existence.

This corrected version should now properly handle the table existence check based on the stdout output from the Hive commands.
