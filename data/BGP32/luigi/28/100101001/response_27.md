### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a database. However, there are issues in the logic that lead to failing test cases.

1. In the first if condition, the function checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout` output obtained from running a hive command. In the failing test cases, the function is not handling the case when `table` is present in the `stdout` output correctly.
2. In the else condition, the function attempts to check the existence of a partition for a table. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling the partition correctly.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is related to how it handles the stdout output from the hive command and the partition check. In the failing test cases, the function is not correctly identifying the presence of the table or partition, leading to incorrect return values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the logic in the if condition to properly check if the `table` is in the `stdout` output when no partition is provided.
2. Modify the else condition logic to correctly handle checking the existence of a partition for the table.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}
                                partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The if condition now correctly checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` output when no partition is provided.
- The else condition now correctly checks the presence of a partition for the table and returns a boolean value based on the stdout.

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
