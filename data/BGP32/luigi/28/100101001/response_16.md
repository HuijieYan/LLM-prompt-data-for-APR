## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing due to incorrect logic when checking if a table exists in the database. The function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which might not always be reliable based on the test cases provided.

In Case 1 and Case 3, the function fails to return the correct result because it simply checks if the table name is in the `stdout`, which is not a robust check for table existence.

In Case 2 and Case 4, the function mistakenly returns `True` when the table name is found in the `stdout`, but it should actually return `False` for case-insensitive comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the function accurately checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. We can modify the function to properly handle the return value of `run_hive_cmd` and introduce case-insensitive comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` values to lowercase and performing an exact match check, the function will now correctly determine table existence regardless of case sensitivity issues. The corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
