### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in the specified database by running a Hive command.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to incorrect results.
3. The error messages clearly state that the function is returning the wrong boolean value for table existence due to case sensitivity issues, as reported in GitHub issues #896 and the related discussion.
4. The bug occurs because the function does not consider case insensitivity during the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command.
5. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Other functions omitted for brevity

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the comparison in the `table_exists()` function to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
2. To ensure case insensitivity, we now compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from the Hive command.
3. Removed unnecessary conditional checks and simplified the return statement for better clarity.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle case sensitivity issues correctly and pass the failing test cases reported in GitHub.
