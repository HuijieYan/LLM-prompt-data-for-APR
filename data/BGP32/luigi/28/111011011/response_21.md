### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests because it strictly checks for table names in a case-sensitive manner.
2. The failing tests are due to the mismatch in case sensitivity between the table name provided and the actual table name in the `stdout`.
3. The bug arises from the fact that the `table_exists` function is not case insensitive, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the provided table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Other functions definitions remain unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive in the `table_exists` function by converting both table names to lowercase, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity for table existence checks.
