### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is failing because it is case-sensitive when checking if a table exists in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The function does not handle case-insensitivity of the table name provided as input.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to match behavior in Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive, which resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
