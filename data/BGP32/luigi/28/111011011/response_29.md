### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the tables found in the stdout. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names are in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. One approach is to convert both the table name and the tables found in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the tables found in the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- For the `else` block, where partitions are involved, we simplify the condition to just check if `stdout` has any value, removing the extra conditions, as the aim is to test for the presence of partitions.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and fix the issue related to case sensitivity.
