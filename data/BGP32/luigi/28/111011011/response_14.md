### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running certain commands and parsing the output.
2. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the function does a direct comparison without considering case differences between the table name provided and the output from Hive.
3. The failing tests show that in one scenario, the table name is 'mytable' but Hive returns 'OK', leading to a false negative. In another scenario, the output contains 'mytable' but the function looks for 'MyTable', causing a false positive.
4. To fix the bug, we should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner against the output from Hive.
5. The correction involves converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using the corrected function above, the case sensitivity issue should be resolved, and the failing tests related to the case differences between the table name and the Hive output should now pass.
