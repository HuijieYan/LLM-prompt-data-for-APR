### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name from the `stdout` with the provided table name.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the `stdout`, which might have different cases. The failing tests demonstrate this issue by showing mismatches due to case differences between the expected table name and the one in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table. This corrected version should resolve the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
