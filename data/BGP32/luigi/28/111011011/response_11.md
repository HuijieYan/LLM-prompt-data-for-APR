The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the direct string comparison without considering case sensitivity. The `table_exists` function checks if the table name is in the results obtained from a Hive command, but due to case sensitivity, it fails when table names are in different case forms. The stdout from `run_hive_cmd` might have a different case, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for table existence. This change aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
