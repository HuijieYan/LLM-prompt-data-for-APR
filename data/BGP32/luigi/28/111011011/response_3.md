### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when comparing the `table` name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The error is occurring because the comparison is done directly without considering the case of the table names.
3. The runtime input/output values indicate that the function is returning False in cases where the table case does not match exactly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking for existence.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`, ensuring that the test cases pass successfully.
