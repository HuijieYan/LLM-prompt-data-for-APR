### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for querying whether a specific table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands to check for the table's presence.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The tests fail because the function does a direct check for equality between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command, without considering case differences.
3. The failing tests show that even though the provided table name and the table name from the Hive command match in terms of characters, the case difference causes the equality check to fail. Thus, the function needs to be modified to be case insensitive when comparing table names.
4. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the provided table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the comparison is done irrespective of the case of the characters.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests.
