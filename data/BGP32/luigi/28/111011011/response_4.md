### Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, corresponding error message, and GitHub issue

- The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database by querying `hive` commands using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The function compares the returned output with the table name to determine existence.
- The failing tests are due to case sensitivity issues in comparing the table names.
- The GitHub issues (#896 and the related discussion) suggest making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
- The test cases reflect the identified problem accurately.

### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error lies in the comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity. The function should perform a case-insensitive check to handle variations in names accurately.

### Explain the cause of the bug using the information provided

- The function compares the table name directly with the output from `hive` commands without converting them to a consistent case.
- Specifically, when the table names in the `stdout` output are in a different case, the comparison fails, leading to the test failures.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, update the comparison in the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to a consistent case (lowercase or uppercase) before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check.
- The function should now return the correct results as expected by the failing tests and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
