### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it performs a case-sensitive check for the existence of a table in Hive, which causes the test cases to fail. Since Hive is case-insensitive, it does not recognize the table properly if the case does not match.

### Bug Explanation:
The `table_exists` function compares the table name with the tables listed in the Hive database, but it does not consider the case sensitivity issue. This leads to incorrect results when comparing table names returned by Hive with the provided table name.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the tables listed in the Hive database to lowercase, we can ensure a proper comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, it compares the table names in a case-insensitive manner, allowing the function to properly detect the existence of tables in Hive regardless of the case.
