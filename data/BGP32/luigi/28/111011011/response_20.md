### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in Hive. The issue arises because the table comparison is case-sensitive.
2. The failing tests indicate that in some cases the table names might have different cases (uppercase vs. lowercase) which causes the comparison to fail.
3. The `table_exists` function compares the table name to the output of the Hive query, leading to false positives/negatives due to case differences. This inconsistency causes the tests to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the table names in the Hive query output.
5. Implementing a case-insensitive comparison will address the issue.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the return statement to use lowercase versions of both the table name and the output from the Hive query, we ensure a consistent and case-insensitive comparison. This correction should fix the issue reported in the failing tests on GitHub.
