### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` method in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
2. The output `stdout` is not being converted to lowercase before comparison with the input table name.
3. The failing tests are due to the inconsistency in the case sensitivity check when comparing the table names.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that the `table_exists` method should be case insensitive to handle tables with different case formats correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` method to convert both the table name and the output `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will make the check case insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` method, the bug related to case sensitivity will be fixed, and the failing tests will pass.
