### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences.
2. The issue reported on GitHub (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle tables with different case formats.
3. The current implementation of the function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to test failures based on the case of the table name compared to the output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the direct comparison of the table name without considering case differences. If the table name in the `table_exists` function and the one returned by `run_hive_cmd` have different cases, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect test results.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, switch to a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before the comparison. This change aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue (#896) and addresses the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures a case-insensitive match, resolving the issue identified in the failing tests.
