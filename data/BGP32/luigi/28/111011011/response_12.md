The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in Hive is case-sensitive. Due to Hive returning table names in lowercase, the current implementation compares the provided table name as it is, leading to test failures when there's a case mismatch between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This correction ensures that both the provided table name and the retrieved table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the test failures related to case sensitivity.
