### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive` is failing the tests due to a case sensitivity issue.
2. The function checks for the presence of a table in Hive and returns `True` if found, which seems correct, but the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` result is case sensitive, causing the test failures.
3. The failing tests cover scenarios with different case combinations for the input table name, and the output stdout is not considering case sensitivity, hence the assertion failures due to case mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the input table name and the `stdout` content to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

from typing import Optional

# Implement the lower-casing for table comparison
def table_exists(self, table: str, database: str = 'default', partition: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` content to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue. The function should now correctly determine the existence of a table regardless of case.
