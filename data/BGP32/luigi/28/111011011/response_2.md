### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is failing due to case sensitivity issues while comparing the table name extracted from the Hive command output.
2. The `table_exists` function uses the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists in the specified database.
3. However, since Hive is case insensitive, table names might be returned in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail when the input table name has different casing.
4. The failing tests demonstrate this issue by providing different casing for the table names in the command output compared to the input.
5. The provided GitHub issues highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle this scenario correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, adjust the comparison between the extracted table names and the input table names to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the extracted table name and the input table name to lowercase for comparison. This modification ensures that regardless of the original casing, the function can correctly identify the table's existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be able to accurately determine the existence of the table despite differences in casing. This change aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue discussions.
