### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names retrieved from `run_hive_cmd` with the input table names.
2. The function currently performs a direct comparison between the table names, leading to failures when the case of the names does not match.
3. The failing tests provide inputs with slightly different cases, causing the function to return incorrect results due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case-insensitive.
5. The suggested fix is to convert both the retrieved table names and the input table names to lowercase before comparing them.

### Solution:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the retrieved table names and the input table names to lowercase before comparison, the function now ensures case-insensitivity. This fix addresses the failing test cases and resolves the reported GitHub issues related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
