### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity of table names properly. When checking for table existence, it is directly comparing the table name with the output `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case.
2. The failing test cases are due to the mismatch in case between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The bug arises because the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity, which results in the test failures when comparing table names in different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

### Fixing the Bug:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue discussion and resolves the failing test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
