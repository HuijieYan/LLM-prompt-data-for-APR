The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests because it is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in the Hive metadata. The problem arises because the function is comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive commands without considering case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for a consistent check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase using the `lower()` method, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison and resolve the failing tests.

This correction aligns with the discussions in the GitHub issue #896, which suggested making `table_exists` case insensitive for better compatibility with various naming conventions.
