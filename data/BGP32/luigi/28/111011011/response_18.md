### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database. However, the bug arises when comparing the table name with the table names returned from the Hive command. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.
   
2. The issue is related to the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function, where it does not handle case-insensitivity for table names properly.

3. The test cases fail because the check `table in stdout` fails due to case differences between the expected table name and the table names returned by Hive.

4. To fix the bug, the comparison of table names should be done in a case-insensitive manner using lower or upper case transformations for comparison.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, modify the comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the returned table names to the same case (either lower or upper), we can ensure a consistent and accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By changing the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This corrected version of the function will pass the failing tests and successfully address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
