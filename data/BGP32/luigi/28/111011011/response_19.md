### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class compares the `table` name with the output `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
2. The failing tests indicate that the comparison is failing due to case differences between the table name and the values in `stdout`.
3. The GitHub issue confirms the problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison between the `table` name and the values in `stdout` without considering case differences.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should modify the comparison to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` values to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now addresses the case sensitivity issue and should pass the failing tests.
