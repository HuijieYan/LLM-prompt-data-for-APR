### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly identify the existence of a table due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function compares the provided table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` without considering case differences, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing tests demonstrate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly, causing the assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case-insensitive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
2. Update the conditional checks in the function to use lowercase strings for comparison.
3. By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function will correctly identify the existence of a table regardless of the case of the provided table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive match and resolves the failing tests.
