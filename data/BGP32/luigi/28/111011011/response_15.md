### Bug Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity of the table name properly.
2. The failing tests are due to the mismatch in case sensitivity between the `table` parameter and the returned table name from `stdout`.
3. The function is currently comparing the exact table name in `stdout` with the provided table name, leading to test failures when there is a case difference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name parameter and the table name in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. This modification will align with the GitHub issues where the case sensitivity is raised as a concern.
3. By ensuring all comparisons are done in a case-insensitive manner, the function will behave correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation:
I modified the comparison by converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, aligning with the requested fix in the GitHub issue. Now, the function correctly checks if the lowercase version of the provided table name exists in the lowercase `stdout`, resolving the case sensitivity issue.
