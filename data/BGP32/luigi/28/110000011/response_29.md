### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running specific Hive commands.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity, where the function does not account for case differences between the table name provided and the actual table name stored in Hive.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the provided table name with the output from Hive commands without converting them to a consistent case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the output from Hive commands to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase).
5. The bug can be fixed by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
- The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the provided `table` and the output `stdout` from Hive commands to lowercase before comparing them.
- This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table name checks.
- The function now correctly determines if the specified table exists in the Hive database regardless of the case.
