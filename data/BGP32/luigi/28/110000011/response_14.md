## Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is performing a case-sensitive check between the table name and the actual table names returned by Hive. This causes an issue when comparing table names that have different case variations.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison is made. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
