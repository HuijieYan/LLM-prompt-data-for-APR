### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in the specified database and partition using `hive` commands.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case-insensitive when comparing table names due to a case sensitivity problem.
3. The bug arises because the function directly compares the table name with the output of `hive` commands without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures when comparing differently cased table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive using lowercase conversions on both the table name and the output of the `hive` commands.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it case-insensitive.
2. Implement the modifications suggested in the GitHub issue to address the case sensitivity problem in table existence checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

### Changes Made:
1. Converted the table name and `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method.
2. Used `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for case-insensitive comparison in the `table_exists` function.
3. Added `bool(stdout)` to check for the presence of `stdout` content in the case of partitioned tables.

By making these changes, the bug related to case sensitivity in table existence checks in the `HiveCommandClient` class should be resolved.
