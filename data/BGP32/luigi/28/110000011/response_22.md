### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file uses case-sensitive comparison when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.
- The GitHub issue points out that tables may have capitalized names, but Hive returns them in lowercase. Therefore, a case-insensitive comparison is needed to correctly verify table existence.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
- The comparison operation `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.
- The comparison operation `table in stdout` does not handle cases where the table names are capitalized differently.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the case-sensitive comparison in the `table_exists` function, which does not account for the case differences in table names between the code and the Hive database.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the comparison operation to use case-insensitive comparison by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now uses case-insensitive comparison by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for table existence. This modification addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensures correct behavior when verifying the existence of tables in the Hive database.
