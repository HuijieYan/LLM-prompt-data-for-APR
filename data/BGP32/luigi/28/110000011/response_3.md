## Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function compares the provided table name directly with the output from Hive, which may differ in case due to Hive being case-insensitive. This can lead to false negatives when checking for table existence.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure a correct match regardless of case differences.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue described in the GitHub reports.
