### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `hive.py`.
2. The function checks if a table exists in the specified database, however, it does not handle case sensitivity issues.
3. The bug is caused by comparing the table name directly without considering case insensitivity of Hive. Hive returns table names in lowercase, which leads to test failures when comparing the input table name.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in [name.lower() for name in stdout.split()]
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the names retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case insensitivity correctly, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
