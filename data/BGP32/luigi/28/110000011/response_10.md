### Analysis:

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a specified table exists in a database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive when comparing table names due to Hive being case insensitive. This problem arises when checking for tables with capitalized names, as Hive will return them as lower case, causing the test to fail.

### Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. When checking if the table name is in the output (`table in stdout`).
2. When comparing the table name and the output (`table.lower() in stdout`).

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the output obtained from the Hive command. The function directly checks for an exact match, leading to failures when the capitalization does not match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive. We can convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing if the table exists in the output. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
