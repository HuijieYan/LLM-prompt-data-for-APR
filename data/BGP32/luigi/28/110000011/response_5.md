### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need for case insensitivity in checking table existence due to how Hive handles table names (case insensitivity).

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case sensitive and does not consider the case-insensitive nature of Hive in the first section of the function.
2. The comparison `table in stdout` without case transformation can lead to false negatives when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the function not accounting for the case-insensitive nature of Hive when checking for table existence. The direct comparison of `table` with the contents of `stdout` without considering case sensitivity leads to failures in detecting existing tables in Hive, specifically when case mismatches occur.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table comparison is made case insensitive. One approach is to convert both the table name and the data in `stdout` to lowercase before making the comparison. This way, the check will be case insensitive and compatible with Hive's behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` are used for comparison, ensuring that the check for table existence is case insensitive and aligned with how Hive handles table names.
