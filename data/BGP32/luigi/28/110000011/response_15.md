### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes issues when checking tables that have different cases.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.
2. In the `else` block, the comparison `table in stdout` is also case-sensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not account for the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. Hive treats table names case insensitively, so comparing them directly results in false negatives when dealing with tables in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and accurately determines if the table exists in Hive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is now case insensitive and will work correctly for table names with different cases in Hive.
