## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for determining whether a table exists in the Hive database.
2. The bug identified in the GitHub issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function currently does a direct comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command, leading to case mismatch issues.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly. If the table name is in a different case than the output from the Hive command, the comparison fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison to make it case-insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below to address the issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
