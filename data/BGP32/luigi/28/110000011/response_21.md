### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is used in the `HiveCommandClient` class to determine if a specific table exists in the specified Hive database. The bug reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking table names due to Hive being case insensitive. The current implementation of the function directly compares the table name with the output of the Hive command, potentially causing failures due to case mismatches.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
- The comparison of `table` with the tables listed in `stdout` is case sensitive.
- The function does not convert the table names to lowercase for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive. Hive treats table names as case insensitive, so a direct comparison without considering case can lead to false negatives.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the `table` name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and aligns with the behavior of Hive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
