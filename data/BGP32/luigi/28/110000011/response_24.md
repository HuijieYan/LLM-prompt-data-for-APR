### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should perform a case-insensitive check to avoid discrepancies due to case differences.
3. The bug arises because the function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This can lead to false negatives when comparing table names entered in different cases.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the comparison in the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence.
2. Uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for a case-insensitive comparison.
3. This change ensures that table names are treated in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
