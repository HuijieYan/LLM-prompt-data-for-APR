### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `hive.py` file in the `luigi` library is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence due to Hive being case-insensitive.

### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive.
2. The partition check could also be case-sensitive.

### Bug cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the function does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output obtained from Hive. If the table names are in different cases, the function may incorrectly report that the table does not exist.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the check is not affected by case differences.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the comparison between the table name and the Hive output is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before checking for existence. This change addresses the reported issue on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves correctly when dealing with case differences in table names.
