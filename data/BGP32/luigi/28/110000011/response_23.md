1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue where it does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This can lead to the function failing if the table name is capitalized differently than how it appears in the Hive metadata.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional statement that compares the table name with the output from the Hive command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name without converting it to lowercase, leading to a case-sensitive check that may fail if the case of the table name differs from what is stored in Hive. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub issue where it was suggested to make the comparison case insensitive.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before the comparison. This way, we can ensure a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.
