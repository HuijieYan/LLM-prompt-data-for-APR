### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a specific table exists in a Hive database.
- The bug related to case sensitivity arises from the comparison between the input table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output. The comparison is done without considering the case of the table names.
- The bug was reported on GitHub where the user mentioned that tables defined with different cases (capitalized vs. lowercase) can cause the comparison to fail.
- The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to convert both the input table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert the input `table` name to lowercase before comparing it to the lowercase version of table names retrieved from the Hive command output using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`.
- This modification ensures a case-insensitive comparison between the table names, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
