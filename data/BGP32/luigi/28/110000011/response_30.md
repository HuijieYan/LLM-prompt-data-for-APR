### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in Hive. The GitHub issue highlights the problem that the function is case sensitive when comparing table names, which causes failures when tables are defined with different cases.

The issue proposes a solution of making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The potential error in the current implementation of the `table_exists()` function lies in the comparison operation between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command. Because this comparison is case sensitive, tables with different casing result in false negatives.

### Explanation of Bug Cause

The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. Therefore, tables with different casing are not recognized as existing tables, leading to failures in the check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug and make the comparison case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that tables are recognized regardless of their casing.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists()` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
