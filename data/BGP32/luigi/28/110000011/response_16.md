## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in Hive based on the input table name, database, and optional partition. 
2. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue - Hive is case insensitive but the function is checking for an exact match of the table name in the output which may differ in case.
3. The user reported that tables defined as capitalized may be returned as lowercase in Hive, causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.
2. By doing this, the function will no longer be case sensitive, and the comparison will be accurate in a case insensitive manner.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
