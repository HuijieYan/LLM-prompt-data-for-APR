## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that tables can be defined with capitalized names while Hive returns them in lowercase, causing the function to fail when checking for table existence.

## Error Locations:
- The function compares the table name directly to the output of `run_hive_cmd` without considering case sensitivity.
- It lacks a check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`. This leads to false negatives when checking for table existence due to differences in case between the provided table name and the table name in the output.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that case sensitivity is considered when comparing the table names. The function should convert both the provided table name and the table name in the output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the provided table name and the table name in the output are converted to lowercase using `lower()` before comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is performed in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
