### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class which is a subclass of `HiveClient`.
- The function utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if a table exists in a database.
- The bug reported on GitHub mentions that the function is case-sensitive when checking table existence, leading to failures when tables are defined with different capitalizations.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive and may fail if the case of `table` and the table name in `stdout` do not match.
2. The comparison `table` with the table name fetched from `stdout` is not case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the function does a direct case-sensitive comparison between the input `table` and the table name fetched from the Hive command output stored in `stdout`. This causes failures when the cases do not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the input `table` and the table name fetched from the Hive command output needs to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lower case before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Converted both `table` and fetched table names to lower case before comparison using `t.lower() == table.lower()`.
2. Used the `any` function to check if any of the table names match the input `table` case-insensitively.
3. Maintained the structure and logic of the original function.
