### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database.
- The function currently checks the exact case of the table name against the output from the Hive command, leading to mismatch issues due to case sensitivity.
- The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid potential errors.
- The proposed fix involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function compares the table name with the output from the Hive query without considering the case sensitivity of the names.
- If the table name in the code is in a different case than the actual table name in the database, the function may incorrectly report that the table does not exist.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we will convert both the table name and the stdout returned by the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.
- By making the comparison case insensitive, we can ensure that the function correctly detects the existence of a table regardless of the case of the table name.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Import the required modules for running Hive queries
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
- In the `table_exists` function, we now convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` result to lowercase before the comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub comments.
- The function now correctly detects the existence of a table regardless of the case of the table name.
- The fix aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue and resolves the case sensitivity bug.
