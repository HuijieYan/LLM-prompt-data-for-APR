### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the specified database. This causes issues when tables are defined with capitalized names, as Hive returns table names in lowercase, leading to false negatives in the existing check.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison between the table name and stdout retrieved from Hive commands.
2. Incorrect handling of case sensitivity in table name checks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the lack of case insensitivity in the comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive commands. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the current implementation does not handle the case transformation, leading to false results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive commands is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase or uppercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the comparison in the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.

By making these adjustments, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity and provide accurate results when checking for table existence in Hive.
