## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not considering case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table. This means that if the table name in the argument is in a different case than the actual table name in the database, the function will return false.

## Identified Issue:
The issue arises in the comparison of the table name extracted from stdout with the table name provided as an argument. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, a case-sensitive comparison will fail.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming a case-sensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table name returned from the Hive command.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison takes case insensitivity into account. We should convert both the provided table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparing them.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the provided table name and the extracted table names from the Hive command output are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.
