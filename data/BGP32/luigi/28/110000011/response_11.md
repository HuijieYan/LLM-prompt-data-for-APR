## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for table existence.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem where tables defined with different case formats (capitalized vs. lower case) result in test failures.
- The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase.

## Error Location:
- The error lies in comparing the table name directly with the stdout without accounting for case sensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises from the fact that the function does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the stdout without considering case differences. This can lead to false negatives when checking for table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them in a case-insensitive manner.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.
