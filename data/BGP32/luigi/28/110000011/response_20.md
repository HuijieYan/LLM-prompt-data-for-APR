### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be made case insensitive when checking for table existence to handle cases where the table names are in different cases (e.g., 'FooBar' vs. 'foobar').

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Comparing table names without considering case sensitivity.
2. Using `and` operator in the return statement instead of a proper check.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name provided with the output from Hive, without taking into account the case sensitivity of the comparison. This leads to potential mismatches when the table names are in different cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # No need for an if-else condition with True/False return

```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check.
- The return statements are simplified to directly return the result of the comparison or the presence of `stdout`.
- The code will now handle table existence checks in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
