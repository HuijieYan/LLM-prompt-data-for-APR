## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive, causing issues with table names that are capitalized. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to ensure accurate results.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.
2. The comparison `table in stdout.lower()` should be used instead.
3. The comparison `table in stdout` in the else block should be replaced with a case-insensitive comparison.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the case-sensitive comparison used in the function, which causes failures when checking table existence with capitalized names. The function needs to account for case insensitivity in Hive table names.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and the output `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that the table existence check is done in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
