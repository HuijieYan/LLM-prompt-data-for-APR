## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue is related to case sensitivity while comparing the table name.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner when it should be case insensitive according to the GitHub issue raised (#896).
3. The buggy function is failing the test cases because it performs a direct comparison of the table name without converting it to lowercase for a case-insensitive check. The expected behavior is for the function to return True if the table name exists in the output of the Hive command, irrespective of case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison.
5. We will update the buggy function to make the comparison case insensitive.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected behavior defined in the GitHub issue.
