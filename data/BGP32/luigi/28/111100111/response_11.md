The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly in checking if a table exists in Hive. The issue on GitHub (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking against the lowercase version of the table name.

### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug lies in the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the standard output. In the case where the table names are provided in different cases, the function fails to recognize them due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison to convert both table names and the tables in the output to lowercase for accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity correctly while checking for table existence in Hive. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values mentioned.
