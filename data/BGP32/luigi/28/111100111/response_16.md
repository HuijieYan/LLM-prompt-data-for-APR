### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a given table exists in the specified database.
2. The bug arises from the fact that when examining the tables in the database, the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly. It directly checks if the table name is in the output without considering case differences.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate scenarios where the function fails due to case sensitivity issues when comparing table names in the output with the given table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table names.
5. The corrected version of the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them to ensure a case-insensitive check.
- For checking the `stdout`, we use `bool(stdout)` to determine if the `stdout` is empty or not rather than performing direct comparisons.
- These changes address the case sensitivity issues highlighted by the failing test cases and the GitHub issues.
