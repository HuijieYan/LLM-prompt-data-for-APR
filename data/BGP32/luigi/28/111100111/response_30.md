## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module checks for the existence of a table in Hive using a case-sensitive comparison. 
2. The failing test case in `hive_test.py` indicates that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failed assertions.
3. The expected behavior according to the failing test cases and the GitHub issue is that the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the results obtained from Hive.
   
## Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output obtained from Hive, leading to inaccuracies when checking for table existence with different cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the Hive output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

## Code Fix:

```python
from typing import Optional
import luigi.contrib.hive

class HiveCommandClient(luigi.contrib.hive.HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table: str, database='default', partition: Optional[dict] = None) -> bool:
        if partition is None:
            stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables;')
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            partition_string = ", ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = luigi.contrib.hive.run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_string});")
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug reported. The correction aligns with the expected behavior reflected in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
