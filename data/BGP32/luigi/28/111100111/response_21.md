**Analysis:**

1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in the specified Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and interpret the output.

2. The buggy function has two main branches based on the presence of a partition:
   - If `partition` is `None`, it runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table in the specified database.
   - If `partition` is provided, it constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of a partition for the table.

3. The buggy function fails to account for case sensitivity when comparing table names in the Hive output. The failing test case expects case-insensitive table name comparison.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
1. Modify the comparison of table names in the function body to be case-insensitive using the `.lower()` method.
2. Update the return statement based on the case-insensitive comparison results.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of table names (`table.lower() in stdout.lower()`) is now case-insensitive. This change ensures that the function behaves as expected in the failing test cases.

By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
