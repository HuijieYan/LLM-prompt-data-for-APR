## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands to find information about the table.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking the existence of tables. The function currently compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test case provided in the `hive_test.py` file checks the behavior of the function in different scenarios and expects case-insensitive table existence checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of Hive commands to be case insensitive.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to lowercase both the table name and the output of the Hive command before comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and address the issue reported on GitHub.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout from Hive commands, the corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and provide case-insensitive table existence checks as expected.
