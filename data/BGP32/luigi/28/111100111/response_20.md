### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check whether a table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failures when the case of the table name does not match the case in the Hive metadata.
3. The failing test cases highlight the situations where the buggy function fails due to case sensitivity issues.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
5. A corrected version is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd
import mock

class HiveCommandClient:
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, the corrected version ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub discussions (#896). This correction should resolve the failing test cases related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
