### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a specific table exists in a Hive database based on the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the `stdout` response, which causes the test cases to fail.
3. The bug is related to GitHub issue #896, which highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the `stdout` response to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
1. In the `table_exists` function, both the `table` and the `stdout` response are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison.
2. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue highlighted in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
3. The corrected function satisfies the expected values and types of variables for all provided test cases and addresses the underlying bug effectively.
