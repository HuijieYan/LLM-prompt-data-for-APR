# The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation of the changes:
- The buggy function was checking the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failure in some cases.
- The corrected version uses `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
- The corrected function now returns `True` if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.
- The function now handles both cases where partition is provided or not.
- The function follows the suggested strategy in the GitHub issue to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass all the test cases and fix the bug related to case sensitivity in table existence check.
