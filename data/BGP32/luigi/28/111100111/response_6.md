There are two main issues in the given buggy function `table_exists`:
1. The comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case sensitive, leading to failing tests in scenarios where the table name cases do not match exactly with the output.
2. In the partition scenario, the use of `self.partition_spec(partition)` is handled incorrectly, resulting in a wrong command being sent to `run_hive_cmd`.

To fix these issues, we need to make the comparison case insensitive and correctly format the partition command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the comparison between the table name and the output will be case insensitive, and the partition command will be correctly formed.

By updating the function as above, it should now pass all the failing test cases mentioned in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output values.
