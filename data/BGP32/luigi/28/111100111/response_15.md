The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity, which results in failing tests when tables are defined with different case formats than expected. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that both the table name passed as a parameter and retrieved from `stdout` are converted to lowercase for comparison to make it case-insensitive.

By updating the `table_exists` function in this way, all the expected cases provided will be satisfied, and the failing test case related to the case insensitivity issue will be resolved. This modification aligns with the GitHub issue raised (#896) and addresses the proposed fix for making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
