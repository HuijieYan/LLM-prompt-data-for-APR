## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check whether a given table exists in a specified database.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The buggy function fails to handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failed test cases where the table name is not in lowercase.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.
5. By doing this, we can ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and the function behaves as expected.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# Import the necessary mock library for testing
import mock

# Update the buggy function to handle case insensitivity
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and the function now behaves correctly as expected in the failing test cases.
