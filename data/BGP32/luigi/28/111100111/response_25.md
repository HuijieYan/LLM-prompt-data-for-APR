After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases provided, it seems that the bug occurs due to a case sensitivity issue in comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The expectation is that the table name should be case insensitive when checking for its existence in the Hive.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command should be done in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` string to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
