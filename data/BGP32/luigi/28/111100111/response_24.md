### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to determine if a table exists in a Hive database. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate the issue by providing table names in different cases and expecting the function to handle them correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to a case-sensitive comparison between the input table name and the table names received in the stdout. The function does not handle the case-insensitivity required, leading to failures in the test cases where the table names are provided in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the names received in the stdout to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the input table name and the table names received in the stdout to lowercase before comparison, making it case-insensitive. This modification ensures that the function handles table names in a consistent and correct manner.
