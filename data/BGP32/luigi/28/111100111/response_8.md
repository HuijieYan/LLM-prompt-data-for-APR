### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. The issue arises when the table name is compared with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
2. The bug is triggered when comparing the table name with the output from Hive; it fails in cases where the table name in stdout is not the exact case as provided.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate scenarios where the output is case-sensitive, leading to incorrect results. The GitHub issue highlights the need for case insensitivity in table existence checks.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the code to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive to handle case insensitivity.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `table_exists` function below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and stdout, we ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the database. This corrected version addresses the bug and should now pass all the failing test cases.
