The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the table name and the table names fetched from the Hive command output, which is case sensitive. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lowercase during comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive and can correctly determine table existence irrespective of the case used in the table name.

This corrected version satisfies all the expected input/output values for the failing test cases provided and resolves the issue raised in the GitHub report.
