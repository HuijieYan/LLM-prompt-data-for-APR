### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity, where the function fails to handle uppercase and lowercase table names correctly. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check the output for table existence.

### Identified Error
The bug arises in the comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive output. The function does not handle case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results when comparing the table names.

### Bug Cause
The bug originates from comparing the table names directly without considering case sensitivity. When the table names fetched from the Hive output are in lowercase, a direct comparison with the provided table name would fail for uppercase or differently cased table names.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that case sensitivity is handled appropriately when comparing the table names. One way to address this is by converting both the retrieved table names and the provided table name to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Code
Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`, the function now handles case sensitivity correctly and will pass the failing test cases.
