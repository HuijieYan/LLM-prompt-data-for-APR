### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given Hive database.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function is currently doing a direct comparison which may fail due to case differences.
3. The failing test cases provide different scenarios with expected output values based on the provided input parameters.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to make it case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This results in test failures for tables with different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison to make it case insensitive. This change should resolve the issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
