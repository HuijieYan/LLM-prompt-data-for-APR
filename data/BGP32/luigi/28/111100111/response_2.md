### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it doesn't handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The bug is related to the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output.
3. The failing test cases highlight the issue by checking for tables with different case variations and asserting the outcome.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the retrieved table names is case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to incorrect results when the table names have different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the retrieved table names case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparing them.
- The `table_exists` function now returns `True` only if the lowercase table name is found in the lowercase `stdout`.
- This will make the comparison case-insensitive and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

Now the updated function should pass all the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue in checking for Hive tables.
