## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue where it does not handle case-insensitive table names correctly. The function is expected to check if a table exists in the database by querying Hive, but it fails to account for case sensitivity.

## Issues
1. The function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name.
2. The test cases in the test file `hive_test.py` are expecting correct behavior when checking for table existence, including case insensitivity.

## Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. We need to ensure that the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive query.

## Updated Buggy Function
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the updated function, we convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive.
