The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` fails to correctly handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function compares the table name directly to the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which might differ in case due to Hive being case insensitive. This leads to test failures when comparing table names with different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output using lowercase comparisons. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing, we can ensure that the function handles case sensitivity correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function pass all the failing test cases.
