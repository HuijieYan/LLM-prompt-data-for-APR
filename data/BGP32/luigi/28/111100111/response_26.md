## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. However, the bug causes the function to check for an exact match of the table name in the returned output, leading to case sensitivity issues.
2. The bug lies in comparing the table name without considering the case of the characters.
3. The failing test cases highlight the issue of case sensitivity in table existence checks, causing the tests to fail when the table names are not exactly matched in case.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be case insensitive by converting both to lowercase or uppercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function will address the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the tests pass as expected.

## Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

# The rest of the code remains the same
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub bug report and allows the tests to pass successfully.
