### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a given table exists in a Hive database. The issue is related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
2. The bug arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases in the `hive_test.py` file demonstrate that the table existence check fails when the case of the table name is different from the one returned by the Hive query.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive table existence check, addressing the bug and making the function pass all the failing test cases.
