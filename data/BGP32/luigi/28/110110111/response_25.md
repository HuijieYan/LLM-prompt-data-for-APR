### Potential Error Locations in Buggy Function
1. Incorrect comparison of the table name with the stdout in the `table_exists` function.
2. Lack of case insensitivity handling in the comparison logic.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to the case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The buggy function does not handle case insensitivity during the comparison, leading to test failures when table names are provided in different cases.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case during the comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity, addressing the bug reported in the failing test cases.
