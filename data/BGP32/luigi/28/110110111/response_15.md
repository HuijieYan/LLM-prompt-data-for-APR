To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
- We convert both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison.
- By making the comparison case insensitive, we address the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread where table names are sometimes returned in lowercase causing the tests to fail when a case-sensitive comparison is performed.

With this corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
