In the provided code, the bug lies in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue arises when checking for the existence of a table without considering case sensitivity.

The problem is that the function checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without handling case insensitivity properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The main change made in the corrected version is to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking if the table exists.

By making this adjustment, the function will now handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.
