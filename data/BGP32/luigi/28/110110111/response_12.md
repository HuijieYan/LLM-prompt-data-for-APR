### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug lies in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable where the case sensitivity is not handled correctly.
   
2. The bug occurs when the function tries to match the table name in the `stdout` variable with the provided table name. However, the case sensitivity of the table names causes the comparison to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable is case-sensitive. If the table name in the database is in a different case (capitalized, for example) than the one provided, the function fails to recognize it.

The failing test case `test_table_exists` tries to check the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. The bug causes the comparison to fail when the table names have different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is consistent and handles case differences.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This version of the function should pass all the given test cases and meet the expected input/output requirements.
