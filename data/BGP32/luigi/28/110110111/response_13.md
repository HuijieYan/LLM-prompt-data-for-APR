The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing the failing test cases due to case sensitivity. The function is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

The issue is that the function directly compares the table name provided by the user with the table names returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when comparing table names, we use a case-insensitive approach.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            if stdout:
                return any(tbl.lower() == table.lower() for tbl in stdout.split('\n'))
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the user-provided table name and the table names returned from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase during comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values and types identified for each case. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
