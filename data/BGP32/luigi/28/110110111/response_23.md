To resolve the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout case-insensitive. The bug arises from the fact that the table names are compared without considering the case sensitivity and may lead to false positives or negatives.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure it ignores the case of the table names. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table names, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

This correction should address the failing test cases where the table names are provided in different cases and would also align with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue #896.
