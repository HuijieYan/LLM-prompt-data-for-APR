The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to correctly check if a table exists in Hive due to case sensitivity issues. The function is comparing the table name from the input with the tables returned from the Hive command without taking into account case differences.

### Error Analysis:
- The function fails the test because it doesn't handle case sensitivity when comparing table names.
- The failing test expects the table existence check to be case insensitive, but the buggy function doesn't account for this requirement.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to convert both the input table name and the tables returned by the Hive command to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- Update the function to return `True` if the table with lowercase name is found in the Hive command output, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the tables returned from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will now pass the failing test cases and account for the case insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
