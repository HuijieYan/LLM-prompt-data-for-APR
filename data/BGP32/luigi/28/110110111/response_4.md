To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will ensure that the function correctly handles table names regardless of case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the function will compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison.

This corrected version will pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values detailed in the test cases. Additionally, it addresses the GitHub issue raised, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive for table name comparisons.
