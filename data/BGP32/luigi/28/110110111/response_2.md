To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them. This will address the issue raised in the GitHub thread and enable the function to correctly determine if a table exists regardless of its case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison and address the failing test cases. The corrected function will now pass all the test cases with the expected input/output values provided.
