## Correction:

Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the error occurs because the comparison of the table name in the stdout is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when it should pass. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the comparison to use the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout, the function will correctly identify the table existence regardless of case. This correction ensures that the function passes all the expected test cases.
