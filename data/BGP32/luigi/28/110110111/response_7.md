To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is case-insensitive. This will address the failing test cases mentioned and satisfy the expected input/output values.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Case-insensitive check
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            # Case-insensitive check
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case-insensitive as expected.

This correction will address the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
