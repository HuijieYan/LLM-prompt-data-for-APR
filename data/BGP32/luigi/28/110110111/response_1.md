The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the stdout obtained from the Hive command. The function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failing tests when the table names are in different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, before comparing the table name with the stdout, both the table name and stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This modification ensures a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function should pass all the expected test cases, satisfy the input/output requirements, and address the GitHub issue raised regarding the case insensitivity problem.
