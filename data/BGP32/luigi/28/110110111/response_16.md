To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking for a match. This will ensure consistent behavior regardless of the case of the input table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

This corrected version should pass all the test cases provided and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding the case-insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
