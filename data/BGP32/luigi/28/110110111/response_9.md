## Correction:

The issue in the buggy function is that it compares the table name to the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. To fix this, we should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                use %s; 
                show partitions %s partition
                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The updated function converts both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparison.

### Justification:

The bug in the existing function arises due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from Hive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the function ensures a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the issue raised in GitHub.

### Expected Outcome:

The corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values provided. Additionally, it aligns with the solution suggested in the GitHub issue for making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
