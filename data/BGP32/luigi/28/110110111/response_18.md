To correct the buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make it case insensitive when comparing the table names. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- We have modified the condition where we check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` by converting both strings to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This change ensures a case-insensitive check.
- For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we simplified the return statement to directly check if `stdout` is truthy (instead of checking `stdout` against a value and returning True/False accordingly).

By making these adjustments, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing tests provided.
