To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables in the stdout case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- We use the `map` function to convert all the table names in `stdout` to lowercase.
- By using `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())`, we ensure case-insensitive comparison.
- In the else block, since the function should return True if `stdout` is not empty, we simply return `bool(stdout)`.
- This corrected version should pass all the test cases provided.

With this fix, the issue mentioned in GitHub should be resolved, and the revised code should now pass the failing test cases.
