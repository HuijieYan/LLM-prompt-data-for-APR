The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing the failing test cases. The issue arises because the function is directly comparing the `table` name with the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

The bug is due to the fact that the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function may not match the case of the `table` name provided as input, leading to failures in the test cases that check for table existence.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the `table` name and the output in `stdout`. This can be achieved by converting both `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This change will make the function pass all the failing test cases provided.

This correction addresses the bug reported in GitHub issue #896 and ensures that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected for case-insensitive table name comparisons.
