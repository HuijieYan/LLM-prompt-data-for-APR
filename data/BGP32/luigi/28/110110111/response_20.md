## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False

```

#### Explanation:
The bug in the original function `table_exists` was that it did not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive to the input table name. This caused the test cases to fail when the table names were different cases.

To fix this bug, the corrected function now converts both the input table name and the table names retrieved from Hive to lowercase using the `lower()` function. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and the function behaves correctly.

By making this simple modification, the function now passes all the provided test cases, including the ones that were failing previously.
