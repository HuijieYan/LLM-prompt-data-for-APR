To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The bug occurs when the table names provided as input are in different cases than the names returned by the Hive command.

### Analysis:
- The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database using Hive commands.
- The buggy function fails in the test case due to the case sensitivity issue where the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands is case sensitive.
- The expected behavior is to make the comparison case insensitive to ensure the function behaves correctly for different cases of table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the 'table_exists' function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the comparison is case insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported in the failing test cases and resolves the case sensitivity problem as documented in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values provided.
