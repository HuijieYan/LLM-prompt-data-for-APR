To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking if the table exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we ensure case insensitivity in the comparison, allowing the function to correctly identify the table's existence regardless of the case in which it is defined.

With this correction, the function should pass all the test cases provided, including the case sensitivity issue reported in GitHub.
