The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it fails to correctly check if a table exists in a case-insensitive manner. The function compares the table name against the stdout without accounting for case sensitivity, leading to failing test cases.

The bug causes the test cases to fail when the table name cases don't match with what's returned in stdout. The corrected function should take care of case sensitivity while comparing the table names.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists()` function to handle case-insensitive comparisons appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False

```

This corrected version of the `table_exists()` function should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
