## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is evident that the issue arises due to case sensitivity when comparing table names. To resolve this bug and make the `table_exists()` function case-insensitive, we should modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the line `return stdout and table in stdout` to `return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

This correction will address the failing test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values, as well as resolve the GitHub issue related to making `table_exists()` case-insensitive.
