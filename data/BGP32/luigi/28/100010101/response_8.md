### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. In the first case, if the string `'OK'` is returned in stdout, the buggy function incorrectly evaluates this as False, leading to a failed assertion. The function should consider any non-empty string (in this case, 'OK') as True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the function to correctly handle the presence of any non-empty string in the `stdout` variable as indicating the existence of the table. We can also simplify the return statements by directly returning the result of the conditional checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True
``` 

By using `bool()` to convert the `stdout` variable into a boolean value, we ensure that any non-empty content will be evaluated as True, hence correcting the bug.
