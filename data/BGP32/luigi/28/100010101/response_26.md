### Identified bug:
The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if `stdout` contains a value and then checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, but the handling of the newline character is missing. In some cases, the `stdout` value may include a newline character which is not handled properly.

### Bug explanation:
1. In the failing test case, the function returns `stdout` with the value `'OK\nmytable'`. 
2. The function checks for `table` in `stdout` without considering the newline character. 
3. Since the newline character is present, it causes the comparison to fail resulting in the assertion error.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the newline character when checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout`. We should split the `stdout` based on the newline character and then check if the `table` is present in the list of strings obtained after the split.

### Corrected function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # Check if table exists in the list of tables in stdout
        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        # Check if the stdout contains any value to indicate table existence
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Note:
The corrected function now splits the `stdout` on the newline character before checking the presence of the `table`. This modification ensures that the function handles cases where `stdout` contains multiple lines correctly.
