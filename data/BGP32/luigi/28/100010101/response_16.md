### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists by running a Hive command. However, the bug lies in the return values. In the first case, the function should return `False` if the table does not exist, but the condition is incorrect. In the second case, when the table exists, the condition also needs to be corrected.

### Bug
The bug is in the checking condition of the return value. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not correctly handling the case where the table does not exist, causing the function to return the wrong result for the first test case.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly check the contents of the stdout. If the table exists in the `stdout`, we want to return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By correcting the return conditions, the function should now pass all the test cases provided.
