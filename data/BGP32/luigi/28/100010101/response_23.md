### Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command.
- The first case expects the function to return `True` if the table exists (`table in stdout`), but it's returning the actual stdout string (`'OK'`). This is why the test is failing for this case.
- The second case expects the function to return `True` if the table exists (`table in stdout`), which seems to be correctly implemented.
- The third and sixth cases involve checking for table existence in partitions, where the function should return `True` if the partition exists. This case will also need correction.

### Bug
The bug in the function is in the logic of returning the actual stdout as the result, instead of checking if the table exists based on the stdout.

### Fix
We need to modify the return statements to check if the table exists within the stdout string. Also, we need to modify the second part of the function to correctly handle partition checking.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ''
``` 

The corrected function now correctly checks if the table exists in the stdout and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.
