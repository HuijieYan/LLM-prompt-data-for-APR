### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the provided code has an issue with how it checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The function is not handling the outputs of the Hive commands correctly, leading to incorrect results.

1. In the failing test cases, the issue arises when the function tries to determine if a table exists in Hive based on the output of Hive commands. This is done using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the Hive query and check the stdout for table names or partition information.

2. The bug seems to be specifically related to how the function processes the stdout from the Hive commands. It is not handling the output strings correctly, leading to incorrect evaluations of whether the table exists or not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `table_exists` stems from the fact that it incorrectly processes the stdout from the Hive commands. The function expects specific formats of stdout to determine the existence of tables, which is not being handled properly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function interprets the stdout from the Hive commands. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where the table names or partition information is present in the outputs. We should check for the existence of the table name or partition key in the stdout before returning the result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the stdout is not empty and then proceed to check if the table name exists in it. This ensures that we correctly handle the cases where the table name is present in the output.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and correctly determine the existence of tables in Hive.
