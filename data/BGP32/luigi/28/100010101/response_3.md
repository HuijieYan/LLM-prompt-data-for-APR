### Analysis
The buggy function has an issue with handling the output (`stdout`) comparison with the table name. The function only checks if `stdout` is not empty, but it should specifically search for the exact match of the table name.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not accurately check if the table name is in the `stdout`. It simply checks if `stdout` exists which leads to the assertion error in the test cases.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of `table` with the `stdout` to ensure an exact match rather than just checking for content in `stdout`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```
