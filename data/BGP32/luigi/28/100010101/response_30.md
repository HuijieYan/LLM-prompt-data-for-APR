### Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to determine if a table or a partition exists in a specified database.
- The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly identifying the existence of tables.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The expected input/outputs values are not being met due to a logic error in the function's condition checking.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
- In the initial if-else block, the return statement for the case when `partition` is `None` is incorrect. It checks if `stdout` is not empty and then verifies if the `table` is in the `stdout`, but this logic is flawed.
- The logic should be checking if the table is present as an individual table in the `stdout`, not as a substring. The current check only validates if the table is mentioned anywhere in the output, causing a false positive.
- In the else block, there is a similar issue where the `stdout` check is not correct, resulting in incorrect identification of table existence.

### Fix Strategy
- Update the condition in the first part to properly check if the table name exists in the list of tables provided in the `stdout`.
- Correct the condition in the else part to ensure it accurately identifies the existence of the table in the given `stdout`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        return partition in stdout
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` using the newline character and checking for individual table names, the corrected version should now accurately determine the existence of tables and partitions.
