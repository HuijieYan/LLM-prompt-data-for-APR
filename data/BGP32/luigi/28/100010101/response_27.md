### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the way it checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The function utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists. However, the implementation of the function does not correctly handle the output when checking for the presence of the table in the Hive output, leading to incorrect results.

In the failing test cases, the function fails to correctly identify the presence of the table due to incorrect parsing of the output from the Hive commands. The function expects a specific pattern in the output to determine if the table exists, but it fails to accurately extract and compare the table names from the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from the Hive commands and accurately checks for the existence of the specified table. We can modify the function to properly handle the stdout from the Hive command execution and compare the table names in a reliable manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.splitlines()
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case where `partition` is None, the function first retrieves all tables in the specified database and then checks if the provided table name exists in the list of tables.
- For the case where `partition` is provided, the function queries for the partitions of the table and checks if the table name exists in the list of partitions.

This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases and accurately determine the existence of the specified table in Hive.
