### Analysis
1. The buggy function has two branches that handle different cases: one for when the partition is None, and the other for when there is a partition.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking if a table exists based on the stdout response from running a Hive command.
3. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the stdout response and checks if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to handle case-insensitive checks for table existence.
2. Update the condition to properly check if the table name is present in the stdout response.
3. Handle cases where the table name may have mixed cases for accurate checking.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions `{table}` partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We are converting both the actual table name and the tables present in stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- Using f-strings for string formatting for better readability and maintainability.
- Modified the partition query for the case when there is a partition to ensure correct syntax for Hive queries.
