### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has two branches depending on whether a `partition` is provided or not. In the first branch, if `partition` is `None`, it runs a Hive command to check if a table exists. In the second branch, if a `partition` is provided, it runs a Hive command to check if the partition exists.

The bug occurs in how the function checks the output of the Hive command. It checks for the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` variable but does not handle the case where the table or partition is not found correctly.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of the `stdout` variable in the `if` conditions. The function returns `True` only if the `stdout` is not empty, but it doesn't account for cases where the table or partition is not found in the `stdout`.

### Fix:
We need to adjust the logic to check whether the table or partition exists in the `stdout`. If the table or partition is found, the function should return `True`, otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return partition in stdout.splitlines()
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking if the table or partition is present in any of those lines, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table or partition.
