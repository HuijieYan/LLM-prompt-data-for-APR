### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not correctly check for the presence of the table in the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The conditions for checking are incorrect, leading to the function failing to return the expected boolean value according to the content of `stdout`. 

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function. The `return stdout and table in stdout` condition does not handle the case where the output contains the table name but with additional content. Similarly, the `if stdout:` condition only checks for the presence of output, not the presence of the table name itself.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the first branch of the conditional statement, `stdout` is checked if it contains the entire output indicator above. This does not effectively determine if the table exists in the database.
2. In the second branch, there is missing verification to check if the table is present in the output. It only verifies the presence of output, returning `True` if there is any output.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditions to correctly verify if the table name exists in the output.
2. Use a different approach to ensure that the table name is accurately matched rather than just checking for any output.
3. Implement a more robust solution that covers various possibilities of table indication in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
``` 

By splitting the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` by newline character in the first case and directly checking if the table is in the stdout in the second case, the corrected version handles the finding of the table name effectively and should pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
