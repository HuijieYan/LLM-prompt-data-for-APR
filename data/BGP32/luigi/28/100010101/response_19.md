### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and determine table existence based on the command output.

The error message indicates that the test cases are failing because the function is not correctly identifying table existence. The expected behavior is to return `True` if the table exists in the output and `False` if it doesn't.

### Potential error locations
1. Incorrect comparison of the table existence condition.
2. Potential issues with the Hive commands being executed.
3. Inconsistencies in handling different cases of table names.
4. Potential issues with the partition check logic.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is likely due to the incorrect conditional checks on the `stdout` variable after running the Hive commands. The function might not be properly checking if the table name exists in the Hive command output.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the function correctly checks whether the table name exists in the output of the Hive commands.
2. Handle cases where the table name might be present in the output but with additional information.
3. Improve the logic for checking table existence for both regular tables and partitioned tables.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return partition in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- The output of the `run_hive_cmd` is split into lines to accurately check for table existence.
- The logic for checking table existence without partitions is fixed.
- The partition check logic is improved to correctly determine the partition in the Hive command output.
