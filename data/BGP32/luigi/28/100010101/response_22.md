### Analysis
The buggy function has two main branches based on the presence of a `partition` parameter. The bug seems to be in the way the returned value from `run_hive_cmd` is checked and processed in both branches. The function is intended to check whether a table (or partition) exists in a Hive database.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first branch where `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the `table` exists by running a Hive command and checking if the `table` name is in the output (`stdout`). The bug here is that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. This condition will return True only if both `stdout` is not empty and `table` is found within it. However, in the failing test cases, the expected output contains only the `table` name when it exists, which means that the `stdout` variable will always be a non-empty string. So, the condition should only check if `table` is in `stdout`.

2. In the second branch where `partition` is provided, the function checks if the specified partition exists for the given table. The bug here is that the condition `if stdout` is used to check if the command returned any output. However, the `stdout` will always have some output even if the partition doesn't exist. So, the condition should be modified to check the presence of the partition in the `stdout` output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditions for both branches:
1. Change `return stdout and table in stdout` to `return table in stdout`.
2. Update the condition in the `else` block to check if the specified `partition` exists in the `stdout` output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return partition in stdout
```
