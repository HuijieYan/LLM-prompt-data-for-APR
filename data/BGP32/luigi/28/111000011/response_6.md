## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is a method within the `HiveCommandClient` class and is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a specified Hive database.
- The bug discussed in the GitHub issue points out that the function is case-sensitive when checking table names, leading to failures when tables are defined with different casing.
- The current implementation of the function only compares the table name directly against the output from the `show tables` command, leading to case-sensitive comparisons.

## Error Location:
- The error lies in the comparison of the table name without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail when tables are defined differently in terms of casing.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive, resulting in false negatives when the casing of the table name does not match the casing of the table in Hive.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to a common case (either lower case or upper case) before comparing them.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before checking for existence.
