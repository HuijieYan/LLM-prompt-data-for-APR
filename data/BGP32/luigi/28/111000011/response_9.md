### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database using Hive commands.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function when comparing the table name to the output from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the comparison `table in stdout` does not take into account case sensitivity, leading to issues when the table names are in different cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive when checking if the table name exists in the Hive command output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name and the output from Hive commands are converted to lowercase before the comparison.
- The comparison is now case insensitive, fixing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By making these changes, the bug related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function should be resolved.
