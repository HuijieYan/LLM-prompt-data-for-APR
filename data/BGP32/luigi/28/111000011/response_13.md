### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Related Information:

1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database.
   
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that table names might have case sensitivity issues when checking for existence in Hive, as Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, causing the test to fail if the table name is provided in a different case.

3. The bug is caused by the comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from `stdout`, which are in lowercase due to Hive's case insensitivity. The function does not handle this case insensitivity, leading to inaccurate results when checking for table existence.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the table names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both the provided table name and retrieved table names to lowercase for comparison.
2. Update the return logic to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})")
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and the table names retrieved from `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`.
- The `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` comparison handles the case insensitivity issue.
- The `partition_spec` is retrieved correctly and incorporated into the Hive command in a readable way.
- The return logic is simplified to directly return the boolean result of `stdout`.
