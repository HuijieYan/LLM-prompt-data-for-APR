## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking table names due to differences in case sensitivity between table names in code and how they are returned in Hive.

## Identified Issue:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly checks if the table name exists in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This can lead to false negatives when the case of the table name does not match with the case returned by Hive.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase (or uppercase) before checking for existence.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison. This change will ensure that the function is case insensitive and accurately detects the existence of a table in Hive.
