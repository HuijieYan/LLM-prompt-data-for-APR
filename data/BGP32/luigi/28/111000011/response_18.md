# Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a specified database.
- The bug reported in the GitHub issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence, which can lead to failures due to case mismatches.
- The current implementation of the function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name from the `stdout`.
- The suggested fix in the GitHub issue is to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lower case before comparing them.

# Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the mismatch of case sensitivity in comparing the table name and the `stdout` returned by the hive command.
- The function fails to perform a case-insensitive comparison, leading to incorrect results when checking for table existence.

# Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case before comparing them. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison and prevent failures due to case mismatches.
- Update the `table_exists` function to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before checking for table existence.

# Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the changes as shown above, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout`, addressing the reported bug in the GitHub issue.
