### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive. This issue is reported in a GitHub issue related to table_existence being case insensitive.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug lies in the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive. There is a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names as Hive is case insensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `table_exists` is comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives when a table exists but the case of the table name is different in Hive output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the Hive output is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
