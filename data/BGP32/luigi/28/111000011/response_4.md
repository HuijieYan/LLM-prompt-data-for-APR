## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence. This means that the function should consider case differences when comparing the table name with the names returned by Hive.

## Potential error locations:
- The bug is likely in the comparison statement where `table in stdout` is checking for table existence. Since this comparison is case-sensitive, it can lead to the reported issue.

## Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the comparison in the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive. When Hive returns table names in lowercase, a case-sensitive comparison will fail to match table names that are originally in a different case (e.g., uppercase).

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix this issue, the comparison between the table name and the names returned by Hive must be made case-insensitive by converting them to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

## Summary:
- The corrected version of the function `table_exists` now converts both the table name and the names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison, making the check case-insensitive.
- This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub as well as ensures that the function works correctly in all scenarios where case sensitivity is a concern.
