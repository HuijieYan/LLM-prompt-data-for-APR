The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` of the codebase has a bug related to checking table existence in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failures when tables are defined in uppercase letters and checked in lowercase.

**Cause of the bug:**
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner with the output of Hive, which returns table names in lowercase. This causes mismatches and incorrect results when checking for table existence.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, we can accurately check for the existence of tables irrespective of case.

**Corrected version of the function:**
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` variable and the `stdout` from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- The case-insensitive comparison ensures that the function correctly checks for table existence regardless of the case.
