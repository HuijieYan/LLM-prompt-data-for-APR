## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` file within the `luigi` library is not case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue identified in the GitHub thread suggests that tables defined with capitalized names might fail the existence check due to case sensitivity in Hive. 

## Errors:
1. The function is not checking the table name in a case-insensitive manner.
2. The function needs to compare the table name in lowercase with the contents of `stdout`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function comparing the table name directly with the contents of `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. This results in failures when checking for table existence with different casing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to ensure case-insensitive matching of the table name with the output received from Hive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the contents of `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing. This change ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.
