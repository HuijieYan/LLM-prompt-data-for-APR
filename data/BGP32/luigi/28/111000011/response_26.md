## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity issue with table names correctly. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This results in a case-sensitive comparison leading to incorrect results.

## Potential error locations:
1. The comparison of the table name in `stdout` without converting it to lowercase.
2. Inadequate handling of case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug arises because the function does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may appear in `stdout` as lowercase even if they were defined with uppercase characters. As a result, the function fails to correctly identify the table's existence based on case-insensitive comparison.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. By standardizing the case of both strings, we ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the original case of the table name.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and correctly identifies the existence of the table in the Hive database.
