The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a case-sensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can lead to failures when the table name in the code does not match the actual case of the table in Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
