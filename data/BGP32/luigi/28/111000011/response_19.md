## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This causes issues when comparing the table names in different cases (capitalized vs lower case). The GitHub issue points out that the function should be made case insensitive to resolve this problem.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison in the `table_exists` function where it checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`.
2. The handling of table names in different cases when constructing the queries.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `table_exists` function does a direct case-sensitive comparison between the `table` variable and the table names in the `stdout` output from Hive. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, this leads to failures in the comparison causing the function to incorrectly report table existence.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. By converting both the `table` and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the table names in the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the function is case insensitive and should now work as expected, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
