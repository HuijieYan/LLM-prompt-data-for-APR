## Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in Hive but doesn't take into account case sensitivity. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which can be in a different case. This leads to failures when the table names are defined differently in terms of capitalization.

The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle scenarios where the table names are defined with different cases.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison between the table name and output from Hive command.
2. Lack of handling case sensitivity in the comparison logic.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This causes failures when the table names have different cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to a standardized case (e.g., lower case) before comparing them.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before checking for the existence of the table. This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
