### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is within the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is designed to use `hive` invocations to find information about tables.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a given database and handles the situation where the table is partitioned by calling `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence.
4. The current implementation directly compares the table name to the stdout, which may lead to issues due to case sensitivity.

### Identified Error:
The bug in the current implementation is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output received from the Hive command.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not consider case sensitivity while checking for the existence of a table. Hive is case-insensitive, but the function directly compares the table name without converting it to lowercase.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, we should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive.
- Simplified the return statement based on the condition result directly without an unnecessary `if-else` block. 
- The function now returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't.

This corrected version addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
