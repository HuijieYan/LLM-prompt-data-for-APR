### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file of the Luigi library.
2. The function makes a Hive command call to check if a table exists in a given database.
3. The bug reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence, as Hive treats table names in a case-insensitive manner.
4. The bug arises from the fact that the function compares the table name without considering the case of the characters, leading to inconsistencies.
5. The suggested fix is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` comparing the table name as it is provided by the user against the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives when the case of the table names does not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name against the output from Hive by converting both to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive check for the table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the output from Hive (`stdout`) are converted to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive and resolves the bug reported on GitHub.
