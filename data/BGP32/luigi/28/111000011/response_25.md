### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem where the table names may differ in case between what is provided and what is returned by Hive.
- The buggy function currently doesn't handle case sensitivity, which leads to failures when comparing table names.

### Identification of potential errors:
1. The function compares `table in stdout` directly without considering case-sensitivity of the table name.
2. The same issue is present when comparing the response of `show partitions` command in case of partitioned tables.
  
### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused due to the mismatch in case between the table name provided and the table name returned by Hive. Hive is case-insensitive, leading to failures when comparing the strings directly without considering case-sensitivity.

### Fix strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the response from Hive into lowercase for comparison.
- Update the `table_exists` function to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
  
### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

### Updated changes:
- Converted `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison.
- Used formatted string literals (f-strings) for better readability.

By making these changes, the table existence check will now be case insensitive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
