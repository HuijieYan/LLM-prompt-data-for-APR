## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in Hive by running a Hive command and checking the output.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
3. The bug exists because the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

## Approach to fix the bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase.
2. Then, check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase output.
3. This approach will ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check and correctly identify the existence of a table in Hive.
