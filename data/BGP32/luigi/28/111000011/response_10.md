### Analyzing the buggy function:

1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check whether a table exists in a given database. 
2. If a partition is provided, it generates a specific command to check the existence of that partition in the table.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem when checking for existing tables in Hive.
4. The bug is caused because the `table_exists` function compares the table name directly with the stdout, leading to case sensitivity problems.

### Bug location:
The bug is located in the comparison between `table` and `stdout` within the `table_exists` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug results from the fact that Hive is case insensitive when returning table names in stdout. The function directly compares the table name with the stdout, leading to false negatives due to differences in case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes made:
- Convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- This updated version ensures a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
