### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the Hive database.
- The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking the table name against the stdout output.
- The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the stdout, which can be in lowercase even if the table name is given in uppercase.
- The function does not handle the case insensitivity requirement mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Comparing the `table` directly with `stdout` without converting them to lowercase.
- The location where the function constructs the Hive command.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` without considering the case sensitivity of the table name and the output from Hive.
- Hive is case insensitive and might return table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail when the table name is given in uppercase.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.
- Update the comparison condition to check if the lowercase version of the `table` is present in the lowercase version of the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation of Correction:
- In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- The comparison condition is updated to check if the lowercase version of the `table` name is present in the lowercase version of the `stdout` output.
- The `bool(stdout)` is used to implicitly convert the stdout to a boolean value for proper return.
