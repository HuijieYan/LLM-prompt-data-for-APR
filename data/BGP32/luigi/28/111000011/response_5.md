### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the table names are sometimes defined with different cases, causing the function to fail.

### Error Location:
The bug originates from the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
and
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is checking for the exact case of the table name in the stdout output, which may not match due to case insensitivity in Hive. This discrepancy leads to inaccurate results when checking for table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name extracted from stdout. By converting both to lowercase before comparing, the function will accurately determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table names are converted to lowercase before comparison with the stdout output, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This adjustment aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion and resolves the problem reported.
