### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that tables with different case formats are causing the function to fail.

The problematic part is in the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` output from the Hive query. In cases where the table name is capitalized, but Hive returns a lower case version, the function incorrectly determines that the table does not exist.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity. Hive is case insensitive, so the table name needs to be converted to lower case for a correct comparison with the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lower case before checking if the table exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lower case before performing the comparison. This modification ensures that the function is case insensitive and correctly identifies the existence of the table in Hive.
