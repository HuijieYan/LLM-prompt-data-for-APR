### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not considering case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The issue on GitHub suggests that tables defined with capitalized names might fail the test because Hive returns table names in lowercase, leading to false negatives.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of table name in `table_exists` function.
2. Handling of case sensitivity in the `run_hive_cmd` function or related functions.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the buggy function `table_exists` directly comparing the table name without considering case sensitivity. Since Hive returns the table names in lowercase, the comparison can result in false negatives when tables are defined with capitalized names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive needs to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case insensitivity. This modification aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue and resolves the issue of false negatives due to case sensitivity.
