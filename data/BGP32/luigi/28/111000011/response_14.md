## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in the database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem of comparing the table name in the code directly with the table name retrieved from the database (which might be in lowercase due to Hive being case insensitive).

## Error Location:
The error is in the comparison of the table name with the values returned in `stdout` without accounting for case sensitivity, leading to failed checks for existing tables.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function is directly comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This causes issues when the table names are stored in a different case in the Hive database than what is passed to the function, leading to false negatives in the check for table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive commands to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and accurate.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
1. Both `table` and values retrieved in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
2. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue of incorrect table existence checks due to case mismatch.

By making these adjustments, the `table_exists` function will now handle case sensitivity correctly, as suggested in the GitHub issue, and provide accurate results for checking the existence of tables in the Hive database.
