## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This issue was raised on GitHub indicating that table names might be returned in lowercase even if they are defined in a different case. The function currently checks for an exact match which leads to failures when table names are returned in lowercase. 

## Error Location:
The buggy part of the function is in the `if` block where it directly checks for `table in stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for case sensitivity in table names. Hive databases are case-insensitive, so table names can be returned in lowercase even if they were defined differently. This causes the current exact match check to fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the table name comparison case insensitive. Instead of checking for an exact match, we should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables returned in the output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the table name and the tables returned in the output to lowercase before comparing them. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and accounts for the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
