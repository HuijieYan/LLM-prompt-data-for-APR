## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case-insensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive. This causes issues when the table name in the code is capitalized differently than how it exists in Hive (case-insensitive). The bug is related to the case sensitivity of comparing tables, and it affects the functionality of the `table_exists` method.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
2. The handling of case sensitivity in the comparisons inside the function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name without considering case sensitivity. Hive is case-insensitive, so a table name provided in a different case will not match when checked against the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` should be case-insensitive. Converting both the table name and the output to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison can resolve this issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Instead of if-else to return True if stdout has a value
```

In the corrected version:
- Converted both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- Used `bool(stdout)` to directly return the boolean value of the `stdout` response.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now function as intended and be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
