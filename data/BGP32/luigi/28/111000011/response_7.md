## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, class, and the GitHub issue

1. The buggy function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is `table_exists()`, which is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function makes a Hive command call using `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The GitHub issue raises a concern that the function `table_exists()` should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence due to Hive being case-insensitive and returning table names in lowercase.
4. As per the issue, the function should compare the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive command to avoid case issues.
5. The current implementation of the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

## Bug in the current implementation
The bug in the current implementation is that the `table_exists` function does a case-sensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output received from Hive. Since Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, the comparison may fail, leading to false negatives when checking for table existence.

## Proposed strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the function `table_exists` to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This change will make the comparison case-insensitive, aligning with the behavior of Hive.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the provided table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
