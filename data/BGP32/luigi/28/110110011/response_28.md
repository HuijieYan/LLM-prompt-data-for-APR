## Analyzing the Buggy Function and Issue:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. The function utilizes `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive command and then checks the output to determine if the table exists. The bug relates to case sensitivity, as Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names.

The failing test function `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` provides a scenario where the function fails due to case sensitivity. The test checks if the function correctly identifies the existence of a table regardless of the case of the table name. The test initializes the `run_hive_cmd` return value with different variations of table names to simulate the case-insensitive behavior of Hive.

The error message from the failing test indicates an assertion error where the function fails to return the expected value when testing table existence. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address this problem.

## Potential Error Locations:
The bug in the `table_exists` function may be occurring when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. Specifically, the comparison might not be handling case differences appropriately, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `table_exists` function to fail when the table name case differs from the output of Hive commands due to case sensitivity issues. The function incorrectly compares the table name with the output, leading to assertions failures in the test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. By doing so, the function will correctly identify the existence of a table regardless of the case.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with case insensitive comparison:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison in the return statement, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and should make the function pass the failing test cases.
