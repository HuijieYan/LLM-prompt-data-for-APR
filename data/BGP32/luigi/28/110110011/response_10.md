### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database. The function takes parameters for the table name, database name, and an optional partition. It then executes a command using `run_hive_cmd` and checks if the output contains the specified table name.

The failing test `test_table_exists` checks various scenarios of table existence using the `table_exists` function. The main issue identified is related to the case sensitivity of table names when comparing them in the function.

The error message from the failing test indicates an `AssertionError` with the message that "False is not true".

The GitHub issues associated with this bug describe the problem as a case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence. The proposed fixes suggest converting the table name to lowercase before comparison to avoid case-related failures.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The bug is likely occurring at the point where the function compares the table name from the command output with the specified table name. Due to case sensitivity, the comparison may fail when the case of the table names does not match.

### Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug is that the function does a direct string comparison between the specified table name and the output table name from the command, which can fail due to case differences. Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names, so a case mismatch can lead to false negatives in the function.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we can convert both the specified table name and the output table name to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will prevent the test failures related to case mismatch.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the specified table name `table` and the table names in the command output are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and fixes the bug related to table existence checking.
