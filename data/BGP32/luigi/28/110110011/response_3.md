### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in the database using hive commands.
2. The bug occurs when the function compares the table name with the output from the hive command without considering the case of the table name.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` are checking for case insensitivity of table names but the buggy function does not account for this, leading to assertions failing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing.
5. The corrected version of the function will convert both the table name and the stdout from the hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
import re

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will now handle the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in the hive database. This change should make the function pass the failing test cases and fix the bug reported on GitHub.
