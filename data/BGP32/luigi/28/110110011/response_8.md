### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
2. The function fails to handle case insensitivity, leading to test failures.
3. The failing test checks for case insensitivity, which the current implementation does not address. This results in AssertionErrors when comparing the expected results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive.

### Correction:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Changed to case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for additional check, returning boolean directly
```

Now, the corrected function uses case-insensitive comparisons to check for table existence.

### Test Pass:
The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases as it correctly handles case insensitivity when checking table names.
