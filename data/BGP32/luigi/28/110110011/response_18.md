### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is meant to check if a table exists in a Hive database based on the given parameters. However, the current implementation does not handle the case sensitivity of table names correctly.
2. The bug is in the comparison logic where the `table` parameter is not being converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout`. This can cause incorrect results when the case of the table names differs.
3. The failing test cases in the test code indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly. The error message shows that the assertion fails when checking for a table named "MyTable" which should be considered the same as "mytable".
4. To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive, ensuring that case differences do not affect the result of the check.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now correctly handle case insensitive checks for table existence in the Hive database.
