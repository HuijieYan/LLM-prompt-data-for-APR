### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly, which is causing the failing test case.
2. The issue is related to case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. The failing test is checking for table existence using different cases (lower case, capitalized) and expecting the function to be case-insensitive. However, the current implementation is case-sensitive because it directly compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function should convert both the table name and the output to lower case before checking for existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes made:
1. Modified the comparison to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
2. Changed the return statement to return `bool(stdout)` instead of separate checks for True and False.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now be able to handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
