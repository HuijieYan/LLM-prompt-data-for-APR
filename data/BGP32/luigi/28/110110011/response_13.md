### Analyzing the buggy function and its related information 

- The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
- The function checks if a table exists in a given database, but there is a bug related to case sensitivity in table name comparison.
- The buggy function fails the test cases `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` in `hive_test.py`.
- The failing test case output the error message: `AssertionError: False is not true`.
- The GitHub issue related to this bug highlights the need to make table exists check case insensitive to handle table names in different cases.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

- The issue lies in how the function compares the table name (case insensitive) with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`.
- The function currently uses `table in stdout` directly without considering case sensitivity.
- To address this bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

- The bug causes the function to fail when comparing table names in different cases because the comparison is case sensitive. For example, if the table name is 'mytable' but the output from `run_hive_cmd` is 'MyTable', the function incorrectly returns False.
- The failing tests clearly demonstrate the issue when trying to compare different case table names, causing the tests to fail with an assertion error.
- The GitHub issue suggests fixing this by making the comparison case insensitive to handle various cases of table names.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name case insensitively with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This can be done by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. 

### Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function can accurately determine if the table exists regardless of the case. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.
