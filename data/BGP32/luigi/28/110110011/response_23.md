### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug occurs when the function tries to compare the table name in a case-sensitive manner against the table names fetched from Hive. This leads to test failures when the table names have different cases.
2. The bug is specifically triggered when the function uses the `run_hive_cmd` to fetch the table names and compare them with the provided table name.
3. The bug causes the test cases to fail because the function does a direct case-sensitive comparison instead of handling case insensitivity as expected by the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and names fetched from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that will pass the failing test cases:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making both the table name and fetched table names lowercase, the fixed version ensures a case-insensitive comparison, thereby resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
