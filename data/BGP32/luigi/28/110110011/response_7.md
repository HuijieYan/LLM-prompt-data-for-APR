### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in Hive, but it is not handling case sensitivity properly as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
2. The bug is identified in the `table_exists` function where it compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug is causing test failures where the function is expected to return `True` for a table that exists regardless of its case, but it returns `False` due to case mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
5. Given below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function.

### Correction:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in GitHub.
