### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, error message, and GitHub issue:

- The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
- The function is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database using the `run_hive_cmd` method.
- The test code `test_table_exists` is testing the functionality of the `table_exists` function.
- The error message indicates an assertion error when trying to verify the existence of a table.
- The related GitHub issue #896 discusses how the current implementation is case-sensitive, leading to failures when comparing table names.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison between the table name and the fetched table names is case-sensitive.
2. The function may not handle different case scenarios properly.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly compares the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which can cause problems due to case sensitivity.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the names fetched from `run_hive_cmd` is case-insensitive.
- Convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for comparison.

### Updated corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to compare lowercase versions of the table names, the bug related to case sensitivity should be resolved. This change aligns with the proposed solution in GitHub issue #896.
