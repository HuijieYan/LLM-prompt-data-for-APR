### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` tries to check for table existence using different casing which fails due to case sensitivity.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails because False is not evaluated as True when checking for table existence with different casing.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to prevent issues with different casing.
5. The suggested fix is to compare the table name in lowercase with the stdout in lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue with different casing in table names.
