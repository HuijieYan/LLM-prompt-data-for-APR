### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is responsible for checking if a table exists in the database. The issue is related to case sensitivity in table name comparison.
2. The potential error location in the buggy function is where the comparison is made between the table name and the output from the Hive command.
3. The bug is caused because the comparison between the provided table name and the tables returned in the `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. Updated and corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
