### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
2. The function fails to check for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` checks for case sensitivity in table names and fails due to the incorrect comparison.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
5. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
The `table_exists` function currently does a direct string comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command, causing the test to fail when the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with the output from Hive. This issue arises when checking for tables with different casing (e.g., `mytable` vs. `MyTable`), leading to failed assertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert both the table name and the stdout from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison to make the check case insensitive.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to ensure correct case insensitivity while checking for table existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Summary:
The issue was caused by a lack of case insensitivity in the comparison when checking for table existence. The corrected function now converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring the check is case insensitive. This fix addresses the failing test case and aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
