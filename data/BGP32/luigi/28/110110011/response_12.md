### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. 
- The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive queries.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function in different scenarios including case sensitivity.
- The failing test expects that table existence checks should be case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function compares the table name without considering case differences which leads to failing tests when the case of the table name does not match exactly with the retrieved result from Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved tables from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Converted the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before checking for table existence.
2. Simplified the True/False return logic for checking whether stdout exists. 

By making the comparison case insensitive, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread #896.
