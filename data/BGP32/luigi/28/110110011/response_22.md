### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug is related to case sensitivity in table name comparison.
2. The potential error location is in the comparison between the provided table name and the table names in the Hive database.
3. The bug is causing the test to fail when trying to check for the existence of a table with a different case than the one returned by Hive. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` due to incorrect comparison.
4. A strategy to fix the bug is to convert both the provided table name and the table names in the database to lower case for case-insensitive comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the corrected version provided above, the bug related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test cases.
