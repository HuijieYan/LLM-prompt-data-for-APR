### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the table exists, as it does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
3. The failing test case `test_table_exists` calls the `table_exists` function with tables of different casing (e.g., "mytable", "MyTable") and expects correct results. The issue arises because the function currently compares the table name directly with the output, resulting in a case-sensitive check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. We will provide a corrected version of the `table_exists` function below.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing both the table name and the output in lowercase, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database. This fix addresses the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub concerns.
