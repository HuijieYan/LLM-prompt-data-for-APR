### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing the table names between the input and the actual table names retrieved from Hive.
2. The bug occurs when checking for table existence in Hive due to case sensitivity issues.
3. The failing test is trying to verify the behavior of the `table_exists` function when providing different table names, including mixed case variations. The error message shows an assertion error when it expected True but got False.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner when checking for existence in the Hive database. This involves converting both the input table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
By converting both table names to lowercase for comparison, the function will be able to identify the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner. This correction will ensure the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the failing test cases.
