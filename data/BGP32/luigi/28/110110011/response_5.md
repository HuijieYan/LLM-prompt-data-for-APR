### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The bug arises from case sensitivity issues when comparing the table names.
- The test case `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` is failing due to the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names in the `table_exists` function.
- The error message from the failing test shows an assertion error because it expected `True` but received `False` due to case mismatch.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the comparison of the table names without considering the case sensitivity of the names.
- The failing test case explicitly tests for the case insensitivity issue when checking table existence.
- The GitHub issues highlight the need for making `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists.
- We should convert both the table name and the returned stdout to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- As suggested in the GitHub issue, we can modify the function to use `table_name.lower() in stdout.lower()` for case insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive as shown in the corrected version, the bug should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test cases.
