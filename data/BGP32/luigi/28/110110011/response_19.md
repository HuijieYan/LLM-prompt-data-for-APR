### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The bug arises when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The bug occurs in the conditional checks where the table name is compared with the output from the hive command. If the table name provided is in a different case than the table name fetched from the hive command, the comparison fails.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` checks for table existence using different case variations, which exposes the bug when the function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly. The error message shows `AssertionError: False is not true` when the function fails to find the table in a case-insensitive manner.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the hive command to a consistent case before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case-insensitive comparisons correctly, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and GitHub reports.
