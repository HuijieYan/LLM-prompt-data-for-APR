### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**: The buggy function `table_exists` is a method within the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`.
   
2. **Identified Error Locations**:
   - The bug might be occurring due to case sensitivity while checking if the table exists in Hive.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The test case `test_table_exists` is failing because it checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, but the original implementation of the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive. This leads to assertion errors when checking for table presence in different cases.

4. **Suggested Strategy for Fixing**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the result from Hive to lowercase before checking if the table exists.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `lower()` method on both the table names and the results from Hive, the corrected version of the function should resolve the failing test cases due to case sensitivity issues.

This correction aligns with the suggested strategy mentioned earlier and should address the reported bug on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
