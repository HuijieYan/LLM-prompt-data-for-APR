## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case insensitivity properly. The function checks if the table name is present in the output of a Hive command, but it does a direct comparison without considering case differences.
2. The failing tests highlight the issue where the function fails to recognize a table name due to case differences.
3. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `True` but receiving `False` due to the incorrect comparison logic in the function.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output to achieve case insensitivity.
5. The correction should address this issue and ensure that the function can correctly determine if a table exists regardless of case differences.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now correctly handles case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This modification should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
