### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for existing tables in the Hive environment.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in the `/test/contrib/hive_test.py` module is testing the table existence functionality with different cases, where the bug is triggered.
3. The error message `AssertionError: False is not true` in the failing test indicates that the function is returning incorrect results due to case sensitivity issues.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid these problems.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. It only compares the table name directly against the stdout, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```
