### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**: The `table_exists` function inside the `HiveCommandClient` class in `hive.py` file has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity correctly.
2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - The comparison of the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity.
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug arises from the fact that the function directly compares the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. Hive is case insensitive, so when the table name and stdout have different cases, the comparison fails. This bug is highlighted in the failing test where it tries to check for table existence using different cases.
   - The failing test indicates that the function is not handling table names case insensitively as required by the test cases.
4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the case sensitivity issue is resolved, and the comparison is consistent.
   - By doing this, the function will be able to correctly identify if the table exists regardless of the case of the table name in the stdout.
5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making this change, the function now converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison for checking table existence.
