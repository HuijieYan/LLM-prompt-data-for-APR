### Buggy Function Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file is buggy.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a Hive database, but it does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
3. The buggy function fails the `test_table_exists` test because it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing table names.
4. The `table_exists` function should compare the table name case insensitively to avoid test failures.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not considering case insensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive with the provided table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, implement a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the issue of case sensitivity is addressed. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
