### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function causes the tests to fail when looking for tables with different casing than specified. The function currently checks if the table name exists in the output with a direct comparison, leading to case sensitivity issues.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison logic in the `if` condition for table presence in the `stdout`.
2. Handling of table names in different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the function's comparison without considering the case of the table names. When the function checks for the presence of a table in the `stdout`, it performs a direct comparison without taking into account the case differences. As a result, the tests fail when looking for tables with different casings.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before performing the comparison. This modification will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to the same case (lower case in this case), the corrected function now ensures case insensitivity during the table existence check. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in GitHub issue #896.
