### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names from the `stdout`. The failing tests demonstrate that the function is case sensitive in comparing the table names, leading to test failures. The issue on GitHub provides insight into this problem, suggesting that the function should be case insensitive for table existence checks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function comparing the exact table name without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail when attempting to check table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and names from `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
