### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands.
2. The function is checking for exact matches between the table name and the result from Hive, causing case differences to lead to failures.
3. The `table_exists` function needs to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase output from Hive to address the case sensitivity problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a mismatch in case when comparing the table names with the output from Hive commands. Since Hive is case insensitive, it returns table names in lowercase, causing failures in the test cases expecting case-insensitive comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison, enabling case insensitive matching.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the corrected version ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This updated function should resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table lookups.
