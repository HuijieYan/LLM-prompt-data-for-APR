### Analysis:
The provided `table_exists` function is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output from `run_hive_cmd`. The function is currently checking for an exact match, leading to failures for tables with different capitalization. The GitHub issue and the failing tests clearly highlight the problem of case-sensitive comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function comparing the table name directly to the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to case-sensitive comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `run_hive_cmd` output, making the comparison case-insensitive.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the `stdout`, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and resolves the failing test cases.
