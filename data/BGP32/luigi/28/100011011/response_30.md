### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The function currently checks for an exact match between the table name provided and the table names returned by Hive, leading to failures when the case does not match. This issue is reported in GitHub issue #896, indicating the need for case insensitivity when checking table existence in Hive.

### Bug Explanation:
- The function compares the provided table name directly with the table names returned from Hive without considering case sensitivity.
- The failing tests show that when the table names are in different cases, the function fails to return the correct result.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to avoid such failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, the comparison should be made case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is not None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show tables")
    
    if stdout:
        return table.lower() in map(str.strip, map(str.lower, stdout.split("\n")))
    
    return False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the query construction for table existence checking to handle partitioned tables correctly.
2. Updated the comparison logic to make it case-insensitive by converting both table names to lowercase before comparison.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in a Hive database.
