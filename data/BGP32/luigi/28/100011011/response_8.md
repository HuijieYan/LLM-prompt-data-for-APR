### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a database by running Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.
3. The error arises when the function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands, causing incorrect results in the table existence check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase for comparison.
2. Update the function to return `True` if the lowercase table name is in the lowercase output and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function becomes case insensitive, which aligns with the intended behavior discussed in the GitHub issues. The corrected function should pass the failing tests and correctly handle case sensitivity in table existence checks.
