### Analysis:
The function `table_exists` is expected to check if a table exists in a given database. However, the bug arises due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name from the database with the actual table name. This leads to failing tests where the expected table names are in different cases compared to what is retrieved from the database.

The failing tests with "False is not true" error indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly, causing the assertions to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of the table names being case-sensitive. When comparing `table` with the content in `stdout`, the function does a direct string match which does not take into account the case. This mismatch causes the function to return incorrect results and fail the tests.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Change the comparison to be case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the database.
2. Convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to ensure a consistent case comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Convert both the input `table` name and `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method.
- Update the return statement in the first block to check if the lowercase `table` exists in the lowercase `stdout`.
- Simplify the return statement in the second block to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

By implementing these changes, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table, addressing the failing tests caused by case sensitivity issues.
