### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity while comparing the table name retrieved from the Hive command output. The code expects an exact match of the table name, but Hive outputs them in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail. This behavior leads to the failing tests where the function doesn't return the expected result due to case mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will ensure that the function can correctly match table names regardless of their case.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing both the `table` and `stdout` in lowercase form, the function will now be able to correctly check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing tests and address the reported issues effectively.
