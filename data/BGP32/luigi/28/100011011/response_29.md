The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison of the table name with the tables retrieved from the Hive commands not being case insensitive. The issue arises when the table names have different cases leading to incorrect comparisons. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case insensitive.

Below is the corrected version of the function that incorporates a case-insensitive comparison:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the table entries retrieved from stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub comments (#896).

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the case sensitive comparison issue.
