### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the Luigi library is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function compares the table name shown in stdout with the input table name directly without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases provide input parameter values, types, and stdout values that demonstrate the need for case insensitivity in `table_exists`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the necessity to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle scenarios where table names are presented differently due to case insensitivity in Hive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function comparing table names directly without considering case sensitivity. When the input table name and the actual table name in stdout differ in case, the function fails to recognize them as equal.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name in the function's input and the table names in stdout to lowercase, we can ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert both the input table name and the table names from stdout to lowercase for comparison, we ensure case insensitivity. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to this bug.
