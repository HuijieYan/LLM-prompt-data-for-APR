### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails the test cases due to case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue reported on GitHub (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve this problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function `table_exists` does a precise comparison of the table name with the output received from the `run_hive_cmd`, leading to test failures when the cases don't match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check between the table name and the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is now fixed by making the comparison case insensitive. This correction addresses the failing test cases and resolves the issue mentioned on GitHub.
