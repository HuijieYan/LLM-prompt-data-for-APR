### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The function checks if a table exists in Hive based on the output of a Hive command but does not account for case differences in table names.

In the failing tests, the issue arises when the table name is provided in a different case than what is returned by Hive. This results in false negatives when checking for table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. It directly checks if the table name is present in the command output without considering the case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to make the comparison case insensitive. The table name provided as input should be converted to lowercase for comparison with the output from the Hive command, which will also be converted to lowercase.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive. This change aligns with the suggested fix in GitHub issue #896.

This corrected version should resolve the failing tests and will ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves correctly for case insensitive comparisons.
