### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the function `table_exists` is case-sensitive when checking the existence of tables in Hive. The function does not account for cases where the table names are provided in different letter cases, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison between the provided table name and the response from Hive. The comparison is sensitive to the case of the table name.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not converting both the provided table name and the response from Hive to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase). This lack of case insensitivity leads to the assertion errors in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the provided table name and the response from Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner. By converting both to lowercase before comparison, we can make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive and pass the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison in the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the function is now case-insensitive when checking table existence in Hive. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and will resolve the failing test cases.
