### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` is case-sensitive. This issue causes the tests to fail when a table name is written with a different case in the `table_exists` function compared to how it's returned by Hive in stdout.

In the failing test cases:
- Case 1 and Case 3 show that the table name is in lowercase in `stdout` while it's provided as `mytable` (lowercase) in the function call. Hence, the comparison fails.
- Case 2 and Case 4 show that the table name is in lowercase in `stdout` concatenated with a newline character and the table name provided in the call is `MyTable` (mixed case). Again, the comparison fails due to case sensitivity.

The GitHub issues provide additional context that the function should be case-insensitive for table name comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison between the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name received in the call and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will ensure the comparison is not affected by case discrepancies.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the comparison between `table` and the names listed in `stdout` is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This modification aligns with the requests in the GitHub issue for case insensitivity when checking table existence.
