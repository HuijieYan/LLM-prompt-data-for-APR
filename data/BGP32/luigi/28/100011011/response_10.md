The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that the comparison between the `table` name and the tables listed in `stdout` is case-sensitive. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the function should also perform a case-insensitive comparison to determine if the table exists.

To fix this bug, one should modify the comparison to ignore the case of the table names. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.lower().strip() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower().strip() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

This corrected version ensures that both the `table` name and the table names listed in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison. This modification allows for a case-insensitive check, aligning with the behavior of Hive.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now reliably determine if a table exists in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
