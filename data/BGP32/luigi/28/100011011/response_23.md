### Analysis:
The function `table_exists` is failing because it does not handle case sensitivity properly. In the failing tests, the table names are provided in different cases, causing the function to return incorrect results. The expected behavior is to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Error:
The function does not normalize the table names before comparing them with the output from the Hive command, leading to case sensitivity issues.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By normalizing both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive. This aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing tests.
