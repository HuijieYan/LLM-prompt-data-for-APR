### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it doesn't handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from the Hive response to the input table name. The function needs to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner to pass the tests. 

In both test cases, the function receives the table name in lowercase in the `stdout`, even though the input table name might be in a different case. The function then performs a case-sensitive comparison, leading to the failed assertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. By converting both the extracted table name and the input table name to lowercase before comparing, we can ensure that the function works correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After applying this correction, the `table_exists` function should now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that it passes the failing tests and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
