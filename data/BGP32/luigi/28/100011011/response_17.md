### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function is not handling the case-insensitive nature of Hive properly, leading to failed test cases due to case mismatches.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Table name comparison handling is case-sensitive.
2. In Case 2, the test data specifically highlights the case sensitivity issue with the table name.
3. The function is not considering the case-insensitive nature of Hive in the table_exists method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function directly compares the provided table name to the tables returned by Hive without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail the test cases when the case of the table names does not match due to Hive's case-insensitive nature.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, a case-insensitive comparison should be used when checking if the table exists in Hive. By converting both the provided table name and the tables from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function will accurately determine the existence of the table while accounting for case differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles the case-insensitive nature of table existence in Hive. This corrected version should address the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
