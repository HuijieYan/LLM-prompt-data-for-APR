### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison between the table name and the table names extracted from stdout might be case-sensitive.
2. The function might not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the function not accounting for case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The failing tests are due to the comparison between the expected table name and the table names extracted from Hive being case-sensitive.

### Fixing the Bug
To resolve this issue and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that table names are matched irrespective of their case.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name `table` and the extracted table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing tests.
