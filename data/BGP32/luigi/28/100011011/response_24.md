### Error Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is currently case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table.
- The failing test cases demonstrate scenarios where the table name case does not match the case of the table name in the Hive query output, leading to AssertionErrors.
- The GitHub issue and the corresponding fix suggest making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase for comparison.
- The current implementation of the function does not consider case insensitivity for table name matching, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the function comparing the table name directly without considering case insensitivity. When the case of the table name in the query output does not match the input table name, the function returns incorrect results, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the tables in the query output to lowercase before comparing them.
- By making the comparison case insensitive, the function will correctly identify the existence of a table regardless of the case.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- In the corrected function, both the input table name and the tables in the query output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- By ensuring case insensitivity in the comparison, the function guarantees accurate detection of table existence.
- The correction aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue to address the case sensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function.
