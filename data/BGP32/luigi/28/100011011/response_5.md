The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout. This results in the test cases failing when trying to assert the existence of tables with different casing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making both the table name and the stdout lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive and the function will correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of casing. This change aligns with the GitHub issue raised and should resolve the failing test cases.
