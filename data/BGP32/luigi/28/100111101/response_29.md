The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic of checking if the table exists in the output of the Hive command. The function returns `True` only if the table name is directly matched in the output, which is causing the failing tests. We need to modify the function to properly handle the case where the table name is included in a newline-separated string.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check to search for the table name in the stdout string properly with newline characters included. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This updated function splits the stdout string by '\n' and checks if the table name is in any of the lines, ensuring a correct match even when there are multiple lines in the output.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing tests provided, as it aligns with the expected behavior outlined for each test case.
