The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional checks for the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout`. The function incorrectly returns `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the specific table or partition is present in it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to validate the presence of the table/partition in the `stdout` before returning `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and partition in stdout.splitlines()
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and checks explicitly if the `table` or `partition` exists in the lines returned by the query. This change ensures that the function correctly determines the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout`.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
