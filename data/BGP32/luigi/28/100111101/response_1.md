The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to lie in how it's handling the `stdout` variable to determine if a table exists. It checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` string but does not handle cases correctly when there are other characters present besides the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table exists in the `stdout` string. Instead of just checking if the table name is present in the `stdout`, we should split the `stdout` string into lines and then check if the table name is present in any of those lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should handle cases where there are additional characters or newlines in the `stdout` string, thus passing the failing test cases provided.
