The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison statements that determine whether a table exists based on the output received from running hive commands. 
The bug is causing the function to return incorrect values when checking for the existence of a table in the database.

The buggy function contains the following issues:
1. In the first branch of the conditional statement:
`return stdout and table in stdout`
This line should check if the table exists in the stdout, however, it should not just be a simple logical AND. If stdout is not empty, we should split the lines and check if the exact table name is in one of those lines.

2. In the else branch of the conditional statement:
`if stdout: return True`
This condition only checks if the stdout value exists, but it does not actually validate if the table is present within the output. 

To fix this bug, we need to parse the stdout properly, checking for table existence in the list of tables or partitions and return True accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            if table in tables:
                return True
        return False
    else:
        partition_info = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_info))

        if stdout:
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            if partition_info in partitions:
                return True
        return False
```

By modifying the function as described above, the function should now correctly identify if the table or partition exists in the given database. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
