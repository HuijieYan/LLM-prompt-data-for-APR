The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function's logic is flawed because it incorrectly determines whether a table exists based on the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The issue arises from the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. This condition does not accurately check if the table exists because the presence of the table name in the output does not guarantee that the table actually exists. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to explicitly check if the table name matches the expected table by splitting the output and checking for an exact match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the bug by properly checking for the existence of the table in the Hive database. It splits the stdout by lines and then checks whether the given table matches any of those lines, ensuring an accurate verification of table existence.
