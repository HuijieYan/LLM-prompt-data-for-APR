### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `table_exists` function where it checks for the existence of a table or partition in a Hive database. The bug causes the test cases to fail when the function wrongly returns `False` instead of `True` for tables/partitions that actually exist.

The issue is rooted in the condition checks and the way the return value is handled within the function. In the first `if` block, there is a potential problem in checking if the table exists based on the output. The `stdout` variable is expected to contain the list of tables in the database, but the function is not correctly parsing this output for table existence. In the second `else` block, the function simply checks if `stdout` exists but does not validate if the partition is actually present.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from Hive commands to check for table existence and partition existence. We should improve the condition checks to accurately determine if the table or partition exists based on the provided input.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and 'OK' not in stdout
``` 

This corrected code snippet makes the necessary modifications to handle the output of Hive commands properly and accurately determine the existence of tables and partitions. The function now splits the `stdout` string into lines and checks if the table is in the list of tables. For partitions, it checks if the 'OK' string is absent in the output.
