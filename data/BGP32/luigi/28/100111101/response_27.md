The bug in the provided `table_exists` function lies in how the condition to check if a table exists is handled. The function is currently returning the result of the condition check directly, leading to incorrect results. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to explicitly return True when the table exists and False when it doesn't.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout is not None
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None
```

By explicitly checking whether `stdout` is not None, we ensure that the function returns True when the table exists and False when it doesn't. This modification aligns the function with the expected behavior, fixing the bug identified in the failing test cases.

After applying this correction, the function should pass all the failing test cases provided.
