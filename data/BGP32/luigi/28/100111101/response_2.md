### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. When checking for the existence of a table without partitions, the function correctly checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout`. However, when checking for table existence with partitions, the function is just checking if the `stdout` is not empty, which is causing the bug. The function does not correctly handle the check for the table name in the output when dealing with partitions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for table existence when dealing with partitions. We should check if the table name exists in the `stdout` in the case of partitioned tables as well. This ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of the table with or without partitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

By making this change, the function now correctly checks for the presence of the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` even when dealing with partitioned tables. This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly for both cases and passes the failing tests.
