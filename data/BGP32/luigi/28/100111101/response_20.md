### Bug Summary
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition to return a boolean value. It fails to correctly handle the case where the stdout includes the table name along with other content. The function only checks if the table name is in the stdout output, leading to incorrect evaluation.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function:
- In the first `if` block, if the `stdout` contains the table name, it directly returns `table in stdout`, which might lead to incorrect results if the table name is part of other text in `stdout`.
- In the `else` block, the function only checks if `stdout` exists, leading to returning `True` even if other content besides the table name is present in `stdout`.

Given the failing test cases:
- In Case 2, the `stdout` contains `'OK\nmytable'`, where `mytable` is present in the text but is not checked correctly.
- In Case 5, similar to Case 2, `mytable` is found within `stdout` but is not properly handled.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to ensure that it accurately checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout`. Instead of just checking if the table name is in the `stdout`, we should ensure that it is a standalone entry. We can split the `stdout` by newlines and then compare each line with the table name.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By updating the function with the corrected logic, it will now accurately check if the table name is a standalone entry in the `stdout`, ensuring the correct evaluation of table existence.
