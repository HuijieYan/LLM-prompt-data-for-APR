The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the comparison of the stdout value with the table name in the function's logic. The function checks if the table name exists in the stdout output but fails due to inconsistent handling of the newline characters. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider each table name separately after splitting the stdout by newline characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')

        return any(table in t for t in tables)
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking the presence of the table name in each table separately, we ensure correct comparison and address the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
