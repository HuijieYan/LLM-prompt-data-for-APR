The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check of whether the `stdout` variable is truthy or not. In the first case, it just checks if `stdout` exists, which can lead to incorrect results. 

To fix the bug, we should specifically check if the table name is in the `stdout` string. Additionally, in the second case where a partition is specified, we need to modify the query to include the partition information and properly check the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table + '\n' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s);""" % 
                              (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return len(stdout) > 0
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the table name followed by a newline character is present in the `stdout`, ensuring an accurate check for table existence. Additionally, for partitioned tables, it properly constructs the query and checks if the `stdout` string is not empty to indicate the presence of partitions.

This correction should address the issues and make the function pass the failing test cases.
