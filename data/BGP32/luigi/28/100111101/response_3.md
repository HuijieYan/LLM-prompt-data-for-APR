### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it does not correctly handle the checking of table existence and partitions in the given inputs. The function currently returns `False` if the table or partition is not found, which is causing the failing test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1 and Case 2 of the failing tests where the table exists in the database, the function should return `True` when the table is found in the stdout. However, the current implementation returns `False` when the condition is not met.
2. In Case 3 and Case 4 where the function should check the existence of a partition, it mistakenly returns `False` even if the partition is found in the stdout.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the conditions for both table existence and partition existence. The function should return `True` when the table/partition is found in the stdout and `False` when it is not found.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

### With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle both table and partition checking and pass the failing test cases.
