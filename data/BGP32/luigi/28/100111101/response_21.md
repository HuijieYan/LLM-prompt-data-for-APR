The bug in the provided `table_exists` function seems to be in the logic of handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking if the table exists based on the output. The function returns incorrect results because it checks if the stdout contains the table name directly, which can lead to incorrect evaluations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how we check the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable. We should split the stdout string by newlines and then trim and compare each line to the table name, ensuring an exact match. This approach will prevent false positives when a table name is a substring of another table name in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` output, ensuring that the tests pass as expected.
