## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is failing the test because it does not correctly handle the case-insensitive comparison of tables. The function retrieves the list of tables using a Hive command and then checks if the desired table exists in the output. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test cases with different table names (differing only in case) to fail.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function.
2. The handling of the Hive command to retrieve table information.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by a case-sensitive comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function. When the test cases provide table names with different cases (e.g., 'mytable' and 'MyTable'), the function fails to correctly identify the table due to case sensitivity. This leads to assertions failing in the test cases that check for table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of table names should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the desired table name and the table names in the output to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. By ensuring a case-insensitive check, the function will accurately determine the existence of a table regardless of the case of the table name.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table names are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification will resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
