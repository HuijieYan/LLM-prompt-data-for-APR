### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test case is checking if the function correctly identifies the existence of a table in a Hive database. The test fails due to the assertion error where the expected table existence is not being correctly determined.
4. The buggy function returns `True` if there is any output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, regardless of whether the table exists or not. This logic is flawed and needs to be corrected.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is actually present in the returned output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. If it is present, then the table exists, otherwise, it doesn't.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});")
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string and checking if the table name is in the list of tables returned, we can accurately determine if the table exists. This bug fix will ensure that the `table_exists` function works correctly and passes the failing test cases.
