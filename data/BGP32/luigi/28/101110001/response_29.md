### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is not returning the correct result when checking if a table exists in the given database with or without a specified partition. The issue seems to be related to the parsing of the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the inconsistent handling of the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the case where there is no partition specified, the function checks if the `table` exists in the stdout directly. However, in the case where a partition is specified, the `table` is not being checked correctly in the stdout. This inconsistency leads to incorrect return values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the stdout returned from `run_hive_cmd` is parsed correctly in both cases: with and without a partition. The function should check for the existence of the table within the stdout consistently, regardless of the presence of a partition.

### Correction to the Buggy Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout
```

### Changes Made:
1. In the case where a partition is specified, the `table` is now checked directly in the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Removed the unnecessary check of the `stdout` before returning True or False.

By making these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
