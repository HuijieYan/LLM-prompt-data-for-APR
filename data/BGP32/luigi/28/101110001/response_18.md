### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands, but it is not passing the correct command when `partition` is provided.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the Hive command is constructed when a `partition` is provided.
3. The failing test is asserting that `self.assertTrue(returned)` when checking for a table that exists, but the buggy function is not returning the correct result.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the Hive command construction in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle partitions.
   - Test the function with various scenarios to ensure correct output.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = " and ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By updating the construction of the Hive command to correctly handle partitions and returning a boolean check on the `stdout`, the corrected version should pass the failing test case.
