### Identified Issues:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case where the command result contains the table name and additional information. This leads to incorrect handling of the return value, causing the test to fail.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not returning the output that is being set in the test cases, which causes the mock to not function properly during testing.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the discrepancy between the expected output in the test cases and the handling of the output in the `table_exists` function. When the command result contains the table name along with additional information, the function is not checking the presence of the table name correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to properly check for the presence of the table name in the command output even when there are additional lines of information present. Additionally, we should ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the expected output in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
Here, we modify the `table_exists` function to split the lines of the output and check each line individually for the presence of the table name.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split("\n")) if stdout else False

# Update the `run_hive_cmd` function return value in tests to match the expected behavior
```

By updating the `table_exists` function in this way, it will properly handle scenarios where the command output contains multiple lines and ensure that the table name is checked effectively. Additionally, making sure the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the expected output in the test cases will help in validating the function's behavior correctly.
