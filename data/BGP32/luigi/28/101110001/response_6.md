### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database, based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The failing test is checking if the function correctly identifies whether a table exists or not, with different variations of table names and partitions. The error occurs due to incorrect handling of the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from `run_hive_cmd` and makes the necessary comparisons.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Simplified check for non-empty stdout
``` 

### Explanation:
1. The corrected version simply adds a conversion to boolean when checking the `stdout` variable. This ensures correct handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. By including the `bool` conversion, we ensure that the function returns `True` when the `stdout` is not empty and `False` when it is empty.
3. This modification aligns the function with the test cases and resolves the specific issue of the incorrect assertion failure.
4. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and correctly determine the existence of tables in the Hive database.
