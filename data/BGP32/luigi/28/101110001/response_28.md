The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is identified in the conditional check for the existence of a table with a partition. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to get the list of partitions and then checks if the output is non-empty to return `True`.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the response from `run_hive_cmd` when checking for the existence of a table with a partition. The way the condition is checked does not account for the presence of the table name in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the code block where `partition` is not None. In that block, we should check if both the table name and the partition exist in the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`. If they both exist, we return `True`, indicating that the table exists with the specified partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the partition are checked correctly in the output from `run_hive_cmd` before determining that the table with the partition exists.
