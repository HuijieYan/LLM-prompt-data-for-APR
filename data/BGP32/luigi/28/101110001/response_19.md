## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It checks if a table exists in the specified database with an optional partition.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The failing test checks if the `table_exists` function correctly identifies the existence of a table. The test fails when the table is expected to exist but is reported as non-existent.
4. The bug is caused by how the function handles the output from `run_hive_cmd` and checks for the existence of the table.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the check for table existence in the `table_exists` function. Specifically, the logic for checking if the table exists is incorrect. The function is returning `True` only if the `stdout` variable is not empty, which may result in incorrect outputs if the table name is present in the `stdout`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function determines table existence. We should check if the table name is present in the output returned by `run_hive_cmd` instead of checking for the existence of any text in the output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            table_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, table_spec))
            return table in stdout
```
