### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands, and the `partition_spec` function to generate partition specifications.
2. The issue in the buggy function is related to how it checks the existence of a table based on the output of Hive commands.
3. When the `table_exists` function is called with the table name "MyTable", it fails to identify the table correctly and returns `False` instead of `True`, leading to an assertion error in the test cases provided.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive to handle cases where the table name has different capitalization.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive and modifying the return statements to return `True` when stdout is not empty, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
