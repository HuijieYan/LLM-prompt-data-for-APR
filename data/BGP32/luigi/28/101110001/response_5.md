The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test because it is not correctly handling the case where the table name is found in the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug is that the condition to check if the table name is in `stdout` is returning `False` when it should be `True`. This is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition to correctly check if the table name is present in the `stdout`, returning `True` if found and `False` if not found.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the Boolean value of stdout (True if not empty, False if empty)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases by correctly identifying if the table exists in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
