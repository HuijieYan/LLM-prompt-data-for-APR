### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle the case where the table name exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function with additional characters. The function currently checks if the exact table name is present in the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd`, which is causing the failure in the test cases where the table name is part of a longer string.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it checks for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd`, which leads to false negatives when the table name is within a larger string.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function returns false when the exact table name is not found in the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to check for the presence of the table name within the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd`, rather than checking for an exact match.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version of the function, it will now check if the table name appears in any line of the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`, rather than requiring an exact match. This change will address the issue of false negatives in the test cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
