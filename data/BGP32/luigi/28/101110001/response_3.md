### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly handling the case when the table name is included in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expecting the exact match instead of checking whether the table name is contained within the output.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `table_exists` function where it checks for `table in stdout` rather than searching for the entire row containing the table name in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to check if the table name is present in any row of the `stdout` instead of just checking for exact match.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
# Imported the re library for regular expression search
import re

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Other functions are unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and any(re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(re.escape(table)), line) for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests.
