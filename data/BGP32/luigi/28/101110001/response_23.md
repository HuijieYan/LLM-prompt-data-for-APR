The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a logical error in the conditional check when the function is checking if a table exists or not in Hive. The issue arises because the function incorrectly checks for the existence of the table based on the presence of the table name in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The current logic of the buggy function is as follows:
1. If partition is None, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists in the specified database.
2. If partition is not None, the function runs a Hive command using the `partition_spec` function and checks if the stdout is non-empty to determine if the table exists.

The problem is in the condition where the function checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout. The correction should be based on the number of occurrences of the table name in the stdout rather than a simple check for presence.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()

        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. For the case where partition is None, the function splits the stdout by lines and checks if the table name is in any of the lines, returning True only if it finds an exact match.
2. For the case where partition is not None, the function simply checks if stdout contains any data (i.e., if it's not empty) and returns True or False accordingly.

This corrected version will ensure that the function correctly determines if a table exists in Hive based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

After making this correction, the failing tests should pass without any assertion errors.
