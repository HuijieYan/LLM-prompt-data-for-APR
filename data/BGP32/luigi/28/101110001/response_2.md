### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to handle cases where the output of `run_hive_cmd` contains multiple lines and the table name is present in one of those lines. This results in incorrect detection of table existence, leading to failing test cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statements in the `table_exists` function might not be handling the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly.
2. The check for the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` might be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect checking of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not consider cases where the table name might be present on a new line in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `table_exists` function to correctly handle cases where the table name might be present on a different line in the output. This can be achieved by properly parsing the output and checking each line for the presence of the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()  # Check the table name in each line of the output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Instead of checking for specific values, just return the boolean value of stdout
```

By splitting the output from `run_hive_cmd` into lines and checking each line for the presence of the table name, we ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly handles cases where the table name might be present on different lines in the output. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
