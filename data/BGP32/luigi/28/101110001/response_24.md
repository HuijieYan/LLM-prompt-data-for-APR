### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table based on the output of running a Hive command. If a partition is provided, it also includes partition information in the command.
2. The function interacts with the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the Hive commands.
3. The failing test is asserting the existence of a table based on the output of the `table_exists` function. The error message indicates that the assertion fails for a specific case.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect comparison logic in the `table_exists` function, especially when checking the presence of a table in the command output.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying the condition used to check for table existence in the command output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition used to evaluate the presence of the table in the command output. Ensure that the comparison logic is correct and accounts for variations in the command output format.
- Update the `table_exists` function to handle the scenario where the table exists in the command output.
- Ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive to maintain consistency in table name checks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making the comparison case-insensitive and properly handling the presence of the table in the command output, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
