### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. However, there are errors in the logic that lead to failing tests. The first issue is with the equality comparison in the `if` statement to check if `table in stdout` which is treating the truthiness of `stdout` as the actual check. The second issue is the incorrect formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block causing it not to work as expected.

### Bugs:
1. In the `if` block, the line `return stdout and table in stdout` should be `return stdout is not None and table in stdout`.
2. In the `else` block, the Hive command is not formatted correctly which leads to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the condition in the `if` block to correctly check if `stdout` is not `None`.
2. Fix the Hive command format in the `else` block to include the partitions correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # other functions...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            partitions_filter = ' AND '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2});".format(database, table, partitions_filter))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

After fixing the issues and running the failing tests, the corrected function should now pass all the tests without any assertion errors.
