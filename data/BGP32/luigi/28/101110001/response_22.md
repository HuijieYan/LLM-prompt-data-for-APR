### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test case because it does not handle the case-insensitivity of table names. The function compares the table name directly without considering case differences, which causes the test to fail when it expects the table name to match in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison when checking if the table name exists in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` directly compares the table names retrieved from the stdout without considering case sensitivity. The test scenarios expect case-insensitive matching, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive when checking if the table name exists in the output. This can be done by converting both the `table` and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

In the corrected version, the table names are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, aligning with the expectation of the test cases.
