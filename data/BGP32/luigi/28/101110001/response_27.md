### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not properly handling the expected output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the given table exists by running a Hive command. If a partition is specified, it fetches the specific partition details. However, the condition for checking the output of `run_hive_cmd` is incorrect, leading to the failing test cases.

### Error:
The error occurs because the buggy function returns `False` when the table is expected to exist, resulting in failing assertions in the test cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where the conditions to check if the table exists are not correctly handled based on the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to properly check if the table exists in the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Handle the case where the table name might contain whitespace characters as well.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table.strip() in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            return bool(stdout)
```

By correcting the conditions to check if the table exists based on the output, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases.
