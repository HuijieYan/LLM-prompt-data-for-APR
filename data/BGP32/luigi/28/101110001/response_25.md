**Identifying the Bug:**
The bug lies in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class. When checking for the existence of a table with a specific partition, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with incorrect arguments. The error occurs due to the way the partition specification is being passed to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

**Explanation of the Bug:**
- When a partition is provided, the `table_exists` method tries to capture the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function but fails to construct the correct Hive query.
- The method uses the `%s` format specifier to pass the database name, table name, and partition specification to `run_hive_cmd`. This format specifier is incorrect and does not substitute the parameters correctly, leading to an incorrect query being executed.
- As a result, the test fails as the method is unable to correctly determine the existence of the table with a partition.

**Strategy to Fix the Bug:**
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` method should construct the Hive query string correctly by directly concatenating the database name, table name, and partition specification. This way, the correct query can be sent to the `run_hive_cmd` function for execution.

**Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Method:**
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Construct the Hive query by concatenating the parameters directly
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By following the above steps and fixing the way the Hive query is constructed in the `table_exists` method, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test without any assertions errors.
