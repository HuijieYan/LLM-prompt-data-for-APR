### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because for the partitioned case, it is incorrectly calling the `run_hive_cmd` function and expecting a return value without checking for the partition's existence.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the conditional check for the partitioned case in the `table_exists` function. It constructs a Hive command using `show partitions` but doesn't verify if the partition exists in the stdout output from `run_hive_cmd`. This leads to incorrect checking of table existence for partitioned tables.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the partitioned case to check if the expected partition specification is present in the stdout output from `run_hive_cmd`. If it is present, then the table should be considered to exist; otherwise, it should be considered non-existent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str.strip()))
    
            return partition_str in stdout
``` 

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now correctly checks for the presence of the partition specification in the stdout output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly for partitioned tables and passes the failing tests.
