The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to incorrect comparison of the stdout output. The function is checking if the table name is present in the stdout or not, but it is not handling the case of additional characters or newlines in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the function to handle cases where there might be extra characters or newlines in the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. For the case where a table is being checked without partition, we split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the table is present in the list of lines.
2. For the case where a partition is involved, we simply return a boolean value based on whether `stdout` is empty or not.

This corrected version should now handle the cases with extra characters or newlines in the stdout output and pass the failing test cases.
