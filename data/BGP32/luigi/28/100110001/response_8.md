The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the fact that the function is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the current implementation, the function is checking for the presence of the table name in the stdout directly, but it should be splitting the stdout into lines and comparing each line with the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function to split the stdout into lines and then check if the table name is in any of those lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Updated version of the table_exists function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `stdout` is split by newline character `'\n'` to convert it into a list of lines.
2. In the `if` branch, we now check if the `table` appears in any of the lines in the `stdout`.
3. In the `else` branch, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout` without any additional processing.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
