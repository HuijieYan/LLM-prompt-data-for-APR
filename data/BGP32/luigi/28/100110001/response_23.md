The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how it checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue arises from the logic for determining whether a table exists or not based on the output of running a Hive command.

Here are the steps to fix the bug:
1. The condition in the first `if` block should check for the existence of the table in the `stdout`, not just the presence of `stdout`.
2. The condition inside the `else` block should return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the partition exists.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making these changes, the function now properly checks for the existence of the table or partition based on the output of the Hive commands, and the corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
