The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it returns both `False` and `True` values but doesn't handle the case where the run_hive_cmd output is empty properly. This inconsistency causes the test cases to fail, as they expect the function to accurately determine if a table exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case when the `stdout` variable is empty after running the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can be done by checking if `stdout` is None or empty before performing the table presence check.

Additionally, we need to modify the function to properly handle the partition case by calling `partition_spec` method correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout and table in stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

After applying this fix and running the failing test case, the corrected function should pass the test cases successfully.
