The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect logic for checking the existence of a table with or without partitions in Hive. The function is not handling the case where the table information is in multiple lines of the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of Changes:
1. In the if block with no partition specified, split the stdout by whitespace to get individual table names for comparison.
2. In the else block with a specified partition, return the boolean result directly from checking the stdout.

By incorporating these changes, the function should now correctly identify the existence of tables with or without partitions in the Hive database.

Make sure to update the function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file and rerun the failing test to ensure that the corrected version passes the test successfully.
