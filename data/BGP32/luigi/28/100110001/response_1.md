The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic when checking if the table exists in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is incorrectly handling the case where the table name is present in the output with extra characters or spaces. This causes the test cases to fail as the function returns incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to handle the table name comparison more accurately. One way to achieve this is by splitting the lines in the `stdout` by newline characters and then checking if the table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the function will split the output by newline characters and check if the table name exists in the list of lines. This change ensures more accurate detection of the table in the returned output.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
