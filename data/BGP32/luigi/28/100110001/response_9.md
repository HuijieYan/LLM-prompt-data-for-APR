The issue in the buggy function lies in the logic for checking whether a table exists or not. The function returns True if there is any output from the `run_hive_cmd`, but the expected behavior should be to check if the table name is present in the output.

The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is not correctly parsing the output from `run_hive_cmd` to check for the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output from `run_hive_cmd` and check if the table name exists in that output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- For the non-partitioned case, we run `show tables` instead of `show tables like "{1}";` and then check if the table name exists in the output after splitting it by whitespace.
- For the partitioned case, we check if stdout is not empty, indicating that partition information exists.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases provided above.
