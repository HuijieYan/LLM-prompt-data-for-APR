### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists()` which checks if a table exists in a database with optional partition details.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists()` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function and tests the `table_exists()` function with different scenarios.
3. The failing test is asserting that a table exists when it doesn't, leading to an assertion error.
4. The error message indicates that the test expected `True` but received `False` for a table that doesn't exist. This implies the function is incorrectly returning `True` in this scenario.

### Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. When `table_exists()` function checks if a table exists with output containing the table name, it needs to handle different formats of stdout correctly.
2. The logic for checking the existence of a table without the need for partition information may be faulty.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of the condition when a response contains the table name but shouldn't indicate that the table exists. This causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant output from the `run_hive_cmd` and ensure it returns the correct result based on meaningful output.
2. Update the logic to handle cases where the table name is present in the output but should not imply the table exists.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split("\n")  # Check if exact match in output
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return based on presence of stdout

```

By updating the `table_exists()` function as shown above, it will now correctly handle the output scenarios and return the expected results. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
