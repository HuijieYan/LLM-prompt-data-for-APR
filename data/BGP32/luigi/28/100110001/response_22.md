The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the comparison logic in the `if` statements. When the function performs the check `return stdout and table in stdout`, it is expecting `stdout` to be a string containing the table name. However, in the test cases, the `stdout` value is separated by a newline character, resulting in the check failing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the stdout by newline character to properly compare the table name. Additionally, we simplify the `if-else` statement by directly returning the boolean value of the condition for partitions.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
