The issue in the buggy function `table_exists` lies in the conditional logic and the comparison of the expected result with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The primary problem is that when checking for the table existence, the function should search for an exact match instead of just checking if the table name is contained in the output. 

Here are the steps to fix the bug:
1. Modify the function to split the stdout by newline character and check for an exact match with the table name.
2. Update the function to handle the case insensitivity.
3. Correct the logic to return `True` when the table is found in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(tbl.lower() == table.lower() for tbl in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(part in partitions for part in partitions)
```

By making these changes, the function will now correctly check for the existence of the table and handle case insensitivity as well. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
