The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the handling of the `stdout` variable. In the if-else condition, the function incorrectly checks for the existence of `stdout` instead of checking that the table name is present in the `stdout` output.

The buggy function returns a boolean based on the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output. The issue arises when the `stdout` contains the table name but in a different format than expected or includes other text along with it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the `stdout` output based on the format of the returned data from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

In the updated code:
- We check if the table name is in the list of tables returned after splitting the `stdout`.
- We return `True` if `stdout` is not `None` in the partition check.

This correction ensures that the function accurately determines if the table exists based on the `stdout` output returned by the `run_hive_cmd`.

By implementing this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
