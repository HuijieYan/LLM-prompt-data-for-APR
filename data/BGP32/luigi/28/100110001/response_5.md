The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the comparison of the table name to the list of tables obtained from the `run_hive_cmd`. The function checks if the table name exists in the output from the command. In the case of multiple table names in the output, the current implementation incorrectly matches the table name without considering exact match. This causes the assertion error in the test cases where table names appear in the output.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the function to split the output by newline character and then check for an exact match of the table name in the list of tables.
2. Trim any extra whitespaces from the output before splitting to ensure accurate comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() == table
```

This corrected version ensures that the function accurately checks for the presence of the table name in the list of tables returned by the `run_hive_cmd` command. It now splits the output by newline, removes any leading or trailing whitespaces, and then matches exactly with the table name. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
