The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check where the return value is being evaluated. In the first part of the function where the partition is None, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is causing the issue. The logic should be to check if `table` is in `stdout` rather than using `and`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to check if `table in stdout`. Additionally, the complete parameterized query construction has issues that could lead to incorrect queries.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version fixes the issue with the `table_exists` function where it now properly checks if the table exists in the command output.
