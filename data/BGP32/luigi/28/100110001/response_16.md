The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to incorrect logic in handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is checking for the presence of a table in the output, but in the case where multiple items are returned, it fails to correctly identify the table.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the case where multiple items are returned. We can split the output by newline characters and then check each line for the exact table name to ensure accuracy.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise

```

By splitting the output into lines and checking each line individually for the table name, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies the table. This should now pass the failing test cases provided.
