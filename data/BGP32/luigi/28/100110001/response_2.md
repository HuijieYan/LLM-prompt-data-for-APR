The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the conditional check not returning the correct value based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. The function is not properly handling the result check after running the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of the changes:
1. Added `.strip()` to the `stdout` output when checking against the table name. This ensures any leading and trailing whitespaces are removed for accurate comparison.
2. Simplified the `if` condition to check if `stdout` has any content, which determines the existence of the table/partition.

With these changes, the function should now correctly return `True` if the table or partition exists, and `False` if it doesn't.

Please test this corrected function with the corresponding failing test, and it should now pass without any assertion errors.
