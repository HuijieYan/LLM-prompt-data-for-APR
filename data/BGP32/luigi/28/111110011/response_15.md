After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue with the table name. The function checks if the table exists in Hive using a case-sensitive comparison, which leads to failing tests when the case of the table name differs from what is returned by Hive.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing tests. This change aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue #896.

After making this modification, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
