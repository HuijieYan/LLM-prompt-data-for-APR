### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The issue arises due to case-sensitivity when checking for table existence. Hive is case-insensitive, so when the function checks if a table exists, it compares the table name with the output from a Hive command without considering case differences, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can avoid case-related issues and correctly determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
