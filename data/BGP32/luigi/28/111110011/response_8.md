## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in the provided database.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` checks for case sensitivity in table names and asserts based on the expected behavior which is not currently implemented in the `table_exists` function.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails when `self.assertTrue(returned)` is called for a case-sensitive table name.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the stdout to make the comparison case insensitive.

## Bug Cause:
The bug exists because the comparison of the table name to the stdout is done without considering case sensitivity. When a table name that differs in case is checked, the comparison fails due to case mismatch, leading to the failed assertion.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout to make the comparison case insensitive.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparison for better compatibility with different table name cases.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure case-insensitive matching. This change addresses the bug and aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
