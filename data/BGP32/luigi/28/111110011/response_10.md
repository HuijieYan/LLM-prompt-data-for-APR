### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The issue is related to case sensitivity in table names causing the function to fail when checking for table existence due to casing differences.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to the assertions failing.
4. The suggested fix is to convert both the table name and the stdout from Hive commands to lowercase for comparison, making the check case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the failure to account for case sensitivity in table names when comparing the table name to the output of Hive commands.

### Suggested Fix:
To resolve the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, convert both the table name and the stdout output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
