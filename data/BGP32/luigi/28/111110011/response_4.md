The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is case-sensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive. This causes the test cases to fail when comparing table names in different cases. The proposed solution is to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names in the returned stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` variable being checked and the table names in the returned output `stdout` are converted to lower case before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check.

This correction will allow the `table_exists` function to pass the failing test cases, as well as address the issue reported on GitHub related to making the table_exists function case-insensitive.
