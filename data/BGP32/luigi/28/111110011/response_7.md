### Buggy Function Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it checks for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner by directly comparing the table name from the command output. This causes failures when table names are provided in different cases.
   
2. The bug is identified in the part where the function checks if the table name is present in the stdout without considering the case sensitivity.
   
3. The failing test case `test_table_exists` in the test file `hive_test.py` expects the function to handle case-insensitive table existence checks, but the buggy version of the function does not cater to this requirement. The error message indicates that the assertion for case insensitivity failed during the test execution.
   
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This modification would make the table existence check case-insensitive.
   
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is case-insensitive.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported in GitHub.
