## Correction:

Based on the failing test and the provided GitHub issue, the bug is related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function. The function should be modified to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and address the github issue related to case insensitivity.
