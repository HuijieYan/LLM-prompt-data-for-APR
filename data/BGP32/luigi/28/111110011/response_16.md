### Updated Function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
1. The issue was related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function. When checking for table existence, the function did not handle case insensitivity.
2. The buggy function was comparing the table name directly with the stdout without considering case differences.
3. The failing test indicated that for a table called "MyTable", the function didn't return true due to case differences. The GitHub issue also highlighted this case sensitivity problem.
4. To fix the bug, the corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check.
5. The corrected function now passes the failing test and handles table existence checks with case insensitivity.
