### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` is demonstrating the issue by expecting the table name to be case-insensitive.
3. The failing test case is checking for a table that is defined with a different case than what is returned by the Hive command, leading to assertion errors.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to address this problem.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from comparing the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, without considering case sensitivity.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that table existence checks are case-insensitive. This modification will resolve the failing test cases related to case sensitivity.
