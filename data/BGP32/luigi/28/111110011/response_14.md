### Revised Buggy Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

### Fix Strategy:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the case-sensitivity in comparing the table names. The correction involves converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.
- By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we address the case-insensitivity issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
- The logic remains the same in terms of checking for table existence in the database.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive table name comparisons and pass the failing test cases.
