## Correction:

### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the tables in `stdout`. The `table_exists` function does a strict check between the provided table name and the tables retrieved from the Hive command, which causes a failure when there are case differences.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from the Hive command is case-insensitive.

### Correction:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By changing the comparison to `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())`, we ensure that both the `table` and the tables in `stdout` are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

This correction should address the issue reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
