The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue where the table names are compared without regards to case. The function should be modified to handle case insensitivity when matching table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, table names and values from the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison. This makes the check case insensitive, resolving the issue of failing tests due to case mismatches in table names.

With this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases, making it more robust and aligned with the expected behavior as discussed in the GitHub issue.
