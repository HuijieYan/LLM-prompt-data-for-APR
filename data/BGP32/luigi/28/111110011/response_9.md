## Explanation:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test because it does not account for case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the output from a Hive command.
- The test is expecting the function to correctly handle case sensitivity, but the function is simply checking if the table name exists in the output without considering the case.
- The GitHub issue mentions that tables may have names that are capitalized, but Hive might return them in lowercase, causing the test to fail.
- To fix this bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from Hive.

## Proposed Fix:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to check for the lowercase version of the table name in the stdout from Hive commands.
2. Use case-insensitive comparison to ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By performing a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout from Hive, the corrected function ensures that the test cases for table existence pass successfully.
