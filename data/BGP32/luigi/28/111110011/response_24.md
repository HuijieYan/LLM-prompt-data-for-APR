Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity issues. The function performs a comparison between the provided table name and the table names extracted from the Hive command output without considering case differences. This leads to test failures when comparing different cases of the same table name.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should modify the comparison to lowercase both the provided table name and the table names extracted from the Hive command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the provided table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests.

This correction aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the stdout against table.lower().
