### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the given Hive database with optional partition details.
2. The issue arises when the function compares the table name with the tables returned by the Hive command, without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate this issue by passing mixed-case table names and expecting the function to be case-insensitive during comparison. The error message indicates that the assertion fails for case-insensitive comparisons.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking table existence in Hive.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the tables returned by the Hive command.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables returned from the Hive command to lowercase, and then performing the comparison, we can ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases, addressing the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub discussions.
