### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test case due to case sensitivity while comparing the table name with the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The test expects case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where the comparison between the table name and the response is case sensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by direct comparison of the `table` name and the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd`. The mismatch in cases of the table name leads to failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` response to lowercase before comparison to achieve case insensitivity while checking for table existence.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` response to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function now passes the failing test case and resolves the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
