The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command. The function only checks if the table name is present in the output without considering the case of the names.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function will now compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output, making it case insensitive.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue regarding the case sensitivity problem.
