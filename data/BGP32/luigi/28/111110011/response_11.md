### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Explanation:
- The bug in the original `table_exists` function was that it was not handling case sensitivity properly. The function was comparing the `table` parameter directly with the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table names were different cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for existence. This change ensures that case sensitivity is handled properly, allowing the function to correctly identify the table's existence regardless of the case used in the input.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function will now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub discussions.
