### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name to the output of the Hive command, which might have a different case.
3. The failing test case in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class checks for case insensitivity in table existence, causing the assertion error.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner with the output of the Hive command.
5. The suggested fix is to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should make the `table_exists` function pass the failing test cases.
