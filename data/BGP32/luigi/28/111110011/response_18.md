To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the stdout received from Hive. The current implementation checks for an exact match between the table name and the content of the stdout, leading to failing tests for cases where the table names are different only in case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We convert both the table name and the stdout strings to lowercase before comparing them. This addresses the case sensitivity issue.
2. The `partition_spec` method is still used to generate the partition string for the query.
3. We return `bool(stdout)` directly in the else block to handle the presence of stdout as a boolean value.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue of case sensitivity reported in the GitHub issue #896.
