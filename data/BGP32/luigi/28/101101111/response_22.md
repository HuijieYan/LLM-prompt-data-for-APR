The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to the case sensitivity when comparing the table names in stdout with the input table name. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, `table.lower()` has been used to convert the input table name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison with the `stdout.lower()` which converts the names in stdout to the lowercase as well. This change resolves the issue mentioned in GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected in all test cases.
