To fix the bug in the provided function `table_exists`, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout is case-insensitive. This will address the failing test cases that check for table existence with different casing.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
1. The corrected code modifies the comparison in the `table_exists` function to ensure that the table names from the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison.
2. By applying `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))`, we make the comparison case-insensitive.
3. This modification addresses the issue raised in the failing test cases and aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
