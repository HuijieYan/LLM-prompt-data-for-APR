The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly to the output from Hive without accounting for case differences, causing the tests to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case insensitivity and should pass the failing tests as expected.

This fix addresses the reported issue in GitHub and ensures that table existence checks are not affected by case differences.
