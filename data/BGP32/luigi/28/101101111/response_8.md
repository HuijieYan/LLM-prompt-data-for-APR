Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function currently checks for an exact match between the table name and the table names returned by the Hive command, leading to failures when there is a case mismatch.

To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive, we should convert both the table name and the table names returned by the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the returned table names to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and passes the failing tests.

This corrected version should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values while also resolving the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
