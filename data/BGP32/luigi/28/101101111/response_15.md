The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output from the `run_hive_cmd()` function. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue indicated in the GitHub thread.
