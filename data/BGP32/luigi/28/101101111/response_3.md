To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues as described in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values provided.
