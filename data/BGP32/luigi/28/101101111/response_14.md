The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output received from Hive. The function fails to handle case differences correctly, leading to test failures as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` output is case insensitive. By converting both to lowercase before comparison, we can address this issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them, the function now handles case-insensitive comparisons correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values as outlined. It also addresses the concern raised in the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
