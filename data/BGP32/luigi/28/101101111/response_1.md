To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking. This change will address the failing test cases and also align with the GitHub issue #896, which aims to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure that the function is case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue. This change will make the function pass the failing test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values.
