After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, we identified that the bug lies in the comparison between the table name and the stdout, which causes case sensitivity issues. The bug stems from the fact that the function does not account for case differences between the table name and the stdout output.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of case differences.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version includes converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This modification addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected in the failing tests.
