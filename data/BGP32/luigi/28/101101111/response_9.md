To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` to be case-insensitive. This will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the input table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table and `stdout` to lowercase, the function will correctly check if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

This correction addresses the issue described in the GitHub issue #896, where tables that have different cases between the input and the Hive output could lead to failing tests.
