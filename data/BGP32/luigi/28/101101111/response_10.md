After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, we can see that the issue lies in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. The comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when the table name casing differs from the stdout. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we make the comparison case-insensitive, satisfying the expected values during the failing tests and resolving the issue identified on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in `table_exists`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing tests and handle case-insensitive comparisons as expected.
