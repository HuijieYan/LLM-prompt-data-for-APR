To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` result. We should convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` result to lowercase before comparing them. This change will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests provided. This correction aligns with the recommendations and discussions in the associated GitHub issue #896.
