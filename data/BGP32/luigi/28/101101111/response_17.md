To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for existence. This addresses the reported GitHub issue (#896) about making `table_exists` case insensitive. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, which resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report. This correction should now make the `table_exists` function work as expected and pass the failing test cases.
