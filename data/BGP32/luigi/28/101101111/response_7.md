Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a case-sensitive check when comparing the expected table name with the actual table names retrieved from the Hive command output. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the table names from the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Assumes the run_hive_cmd and partition_spec functions are correctly implemented

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the table names from the Hive command output to lowercase before performing the check, addressing the case sensitivity issue.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned. This fix also aligns with the GitHub issue mentioned, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Please replace the existing `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class with this corrected version to resolve the bug.
