To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This will resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub issue as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing both the table name and stdout in lowercase, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence. This fix aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing tests and addresses the GitHub issue about making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
