The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it checks if a table exists in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures where the table names are not in the exact case. To fix this, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction ensures that both the table name and the tables in the output are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This change allows the function to pass the failing test cases and also addresses the GitHub issue raised regarding making `table_exists` case-insensitive.
