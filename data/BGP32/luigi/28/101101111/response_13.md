Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the main issue arises when comparing the table names in the output (stdout) with the table names passed to the `table_exists` function. Hive is case-insensitive, but the comparison is case-sensitive in the current implementation, leading to test failures when table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to make the comparison between the table names case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the table names in the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will now return the correct results for the failing test cases mentioned in the test function.

This correction aligns with the GitHub issue #896, where it was proposed to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive for table name comparisons.

By applying this fix, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues with table names in Hive, resolving the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
