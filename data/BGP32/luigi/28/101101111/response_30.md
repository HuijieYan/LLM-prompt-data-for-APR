To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and the content of `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This adjustment will address the failing test cases when the table names are provided in different cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Updated and corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the content of `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive. This change aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue #896.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases outlined in the provided test function.
