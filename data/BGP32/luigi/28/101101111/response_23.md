## Correction:

After analyzing the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity in comparing the table names. The function should compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, before comparing table names, the given `table` parameter is converted to lowercase using `table_lower = table.lower()`. This change ensures that case differences are ignored in the comparison process.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and handle case sensitivity issues as described in the GitHub issue.

Feel free to implement this correction in your code base. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
