To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output case-insensitive. Currently, the function directly compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may cause issues due to case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function will be case-insensitive and should now pass the failing test cases described in the test code.

This correction addresses the issues reported in the GitHub issue #896 titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive" where it was suggested to check `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid case sensitivity issues.
