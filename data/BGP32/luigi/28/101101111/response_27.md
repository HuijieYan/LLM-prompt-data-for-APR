The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to test failures when the case of the table name is different.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be made case-insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive table existence checks.

This corrected version should address the failing tests and align with the expected inputs/outputs and the GitHub issue regarding making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
