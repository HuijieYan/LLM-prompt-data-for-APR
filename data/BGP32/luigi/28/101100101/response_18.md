The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the way the `stdout` variable is checked for the presence of the table name. In the `if` condition, using `return stdout and table in stdout` will return `True` if `stdout` is not an empty string (since empty strings are falsy) without checking if the table is actually present in `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the check for the table name in the `stdout`. We can split the lines in the `stdout` by `\n` and then check if the table is in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        # Split the lines by \n and check if the table is in the list of tables
        return stdout.strip() and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table in the output from the Hive command.
