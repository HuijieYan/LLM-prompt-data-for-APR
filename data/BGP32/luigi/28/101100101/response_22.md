### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` has two branches based on the presence of a partition. In the first branch, it runs a Hive command to check if a table exists in a given database. In the second branch, it constructs a Hive command to check if a specific partition of a table exists and runs it. The bug seems to stem from the logic in the second branch.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first branch of the `table_exists` function, the implementation checks if the `table` exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This logic is correct and working as expected.
   
2. However, in the second branch of the function, when a partition is provided, the implementation constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of that specific partition. The function calls `self.partition_spec(partition)` to get the partition specification. This function is not mocked or overridden during the test, which causes unexpected behavior.
   
3. Since `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not correctly mocked or overridden, the `stdout` is not being populated as expected, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the `self.partition_spec` function is correctly mocked in the test cases. By providing the expected return value for `self.partition_spec`, we can control the behavior of the function during testing.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_spec_output))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By using the correct `partition_spec_output` from `self.partition_spec(partition)` before running the Hive command in the second branch, we ensure the function behaves as expected. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass all the relevant test cases.
