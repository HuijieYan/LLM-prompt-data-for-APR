## Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function checks whether a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
3. There are two branches in the function based on whether a partition is provided or not.
4. The function currently has issues with correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determining if the table exists.

## Bug
The bug in the current implementation lies in the checking of the stdout variable. The function expects `OK\n<table_name>` if the table exists, but it doesn't handle the case where there may be extra newlines or formatting in the `stdout` output.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd` to ensure that the table name is correctly extracted and compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            # Check if the table name is in stdout
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
    
            # Check if the partition exists in stdout
            return stdout is not None and len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

With this fix, we split the `stdout` by newline characters to ensure we are comparing only the table name. In the case of partitions, we construct the partition string and check for its existence in the `stdout`. 

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases mentioned.
