Firstly, let's analyze the buggy function `table_exists` and compare it with the failing test cases provided.

In the `table_exists` function:
1. The function checks if a `partition` is provided. If not, it runs a Hive command to check if a table exists in a specific database.
2. If a `partition` is provided, it constructs a Hive command using `run_hive_cmd` function and `self.partition_spec`.
3. The function returns `True` if the stdout is not empty, indicating the table exists.

Now let's look at the failing test cases:
1. In case 1:
   - The expected parameters are 'default' database and 'mytable' table.
   - The expected stdout is 'OK'.
   - The function should return `False` because 'mytable' is not in 'OK'.

2. In case 2:
   - Similar to case 1 but the table name is 'MyTable', which should be case-insensitive.
   - The expected stdout in this case contains 'mytable', which should be recognized.

3. In case 3:
   - The expected parameters include a partition.
   - The expected stout contains multiple lines describing partitions.
   - The function should return `True` if the table exists.

Based on the failing test cases, the bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name with the stdout of the Hive command. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the function to fail.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the comparison of the table name in stdout to be case-insensitive.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases when the table exists in the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # returning directly the boolean value of stdout
```

This updated version of the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases by considering case-insensitive comparison for table names.
