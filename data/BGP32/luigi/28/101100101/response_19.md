## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database in Hive. The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function returns `stdout` if the table is found, but the condition to check this is not correctly implemented.

The issue arises when comparing `table in stdout`. This condition is not handling cases where the table name is a subset of another table name in the stdout.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `table_exists` is due to the flawed condition to check if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The buggy implementation uses `table in stdout`, which can lead to false positives when there are multiple tables present in the output and the table name is a subset of another. For example, if `stdout` contains tables "mytable" and "mytable2", checking for "mytable" could also be true when it shouldn't be.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to precisely match the table name in the stdout without considering substring matches. This can be achieved by splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking each line for an exact match with the table name.

## Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

The corrected version uses `any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))` to precisely match the table names without considering substring matches. This ensures the function behaves as expected and passes all the given test cases.
