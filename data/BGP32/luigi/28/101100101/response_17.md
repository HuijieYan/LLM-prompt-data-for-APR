The bug in the provided function is that the conditional check on the `stdout` variable is incorrect. The function checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists, but it should actually check if the table name is in the output. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check for the presence of the table name in the output string, rather than the existence of the output string itself.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

With this correction, the function should now pass all the test cases provided.
