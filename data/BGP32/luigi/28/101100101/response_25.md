## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of a table. When checking for the existence of a table with a given name, the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly. This results in incorrect behavior when checking if a table exists, especially when the table name is provided in different cases.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison check between the provided table name and the tables returned from the Hive command. We should ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive to accurately determine whether the table exists. Additionally, we need to handle the case where no tables are returned from the Hive command response.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
    
```

By updating the comparison to be case-insensitive and handling the empty stdout return correctly, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided above.
