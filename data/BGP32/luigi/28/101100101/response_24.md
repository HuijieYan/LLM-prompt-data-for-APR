The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the output `stdout` with the table name. The bug is due to the fact that the check for table existence in the `stdout` is not accurate. The function checks if the exact table name exists in the `stdout`, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` by newline characters `\n` and check if any of the lines contain the table name. This way, we can ensure that we are correctly checking for table existence in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout != ""
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if any of the lines match the table name in the first case. In the second case, it simply checks if the `stdout` is not empty to determine the existence of the table.

With this correction, the function should pass all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
