The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in how it checks for the existence of a table or partition. The bug occurs because the function is checking if the output of `run_hive_cmd` contains the table name or partition, without accounting for the possibility of the table or partition name being a substring of another name in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function only matches exact table or partition names in the output and not substrings.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(t == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return any(p == self.partition_spec(partition) for p in partitions)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly check for the exact table or partition names in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, addressing the bug described.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases mentioned in the initial problem statement.
