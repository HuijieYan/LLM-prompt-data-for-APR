### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue in the way it checks for the table existence. In the first case, it checks if the table exists by searching for the table name in the output, which could lead to partial matches. In the second case, it correctly checks for the exact existence of the table by parsing the output.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first case, when checking for table existence with `'mytable'`, if the `stdout` contains anything related to `'mytable'`, the condition `table in stdout` will return `True`, leading to incorrect behavior.
   
2. In the second case, the correct behavior is seen when the exact string `'mytable'` is present in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison method in the first case to support exact matching. One way to do this is by utilizing the `splitlines` method to split the `stdout` into lines, ensuring an exact match. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        tables = stdout.strip().splitlines()
        return table in tables

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` into lines in the first case ('table in stdout'), we ensure the exact matching and resolve the bug. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
