### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. In the code for the `table_exists` function, when checking if the table exists in the stdout returned from `run_hive_cmd`, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. It only checks if the `stdout` is not an empty string and if the `table` is present in `stdout`, leading to incorrect evaluation for the existence of the table. This is causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the conditional statement to accurately check if the table exists. The function should return `True` if and only if both the `stdout` is not empty and the `table` is present as a whole word in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and f"table '{table}'" in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By changing the condition to check for the whole word "table '{table}'" in the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`, we ensure that the function correctly verifies the existence of the table. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases mentioned.
