### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a given table exists in a database using Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects certain outputs from `run_hive_cmd`, so the bug might be in how the function interprets the outputs to determine if a table exists or not.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to decide if a table exists or not. The function checks if the table name is present in the output to determine existence. However, in the case where the table is found in the output, the function improperly checks if the output is just empty or not, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks the existence of a table in the output from `run_hive_cmd`. We should ensure that we properly handle cases where the table is found in the output to return `True` and when it is not found to return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout.strip() != "":
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison in the `else` block to check if the `stdout` is not empty after stripping whitespace, we can ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of a table in the Hive command output. This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
