### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way the stdout is checked in the if conditions. In the first if condition, the function checks `stdout and table in stdout` which could cause issues if the stdout is an empty string as an empty string is considered falsy in Python. Similarly, in the second if condition, the function checks `if stdout` which would return False if stdout is an empty string.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the if conditions to properly check if the table exists in the stdout. We will update the conditions to explicitly check for an empty stdout or table not in stdout in order to handle the corner case where stdout is an empty string.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the stdout to a list based on newline characters and checking if the table is in that list, we can properly handle the case of an empty stdout while checking for table existence. Additionally, we are updating the return values to fit the expected behavior of the function based on the provided test cases.
