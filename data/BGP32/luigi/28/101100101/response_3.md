### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is calling `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. However, it has issues in handling different scenarios like checking partitioned tables. The function evaluates the output of `run_hive_cmd` without considering additional cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Issue:
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function when dealing with partitioned tables. The `stdout` variable comparison does not cover all possible scenarios, causing the function to return incorrect results for partitioned tables.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the different scenarios for table existence checks, especially for partitioned tables. We need to consider the presence of both table names and partition specs in the `stdout` variable when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            if table not in stdout:
                return False
            partition_filter = "partition ({})".format(','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()]))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}'.format(database, table, partition_filter))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the logic in the `table_exists` function to include additional checks for partitioned tables, we ensure that the function correctly evaluates the table existence based on both table names and partition specifications. This corrected version should pass all the test cases provided.
