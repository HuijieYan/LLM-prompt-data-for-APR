### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way the `stdout` variable is checked for the presence of the `table` name. In the `if` condition where it checks `table in stdout`, it doesn't handle the case where the table names are separated by newline characters. Therefore, it fails to match the table name in cases where there are multiple table names separated by newline characters in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the `table` name exists in any of the split parts.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking if the table exists in any of the split parts, we address the bug in the original function. This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
