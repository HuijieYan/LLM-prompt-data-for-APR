### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has two main issues:
1. In the first conditional block, the existence check of the table in `stdout` should include a check for the table name in each line of `stdout`, not just the presence of `stdout`.
2. In the `else` block, the command being executed to check for partitions is incorrect because it is not constructing the partition string properly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When checking for table existence, the function checks if the `table` name is in `stdout`, but the `stdout` might contain multiple lines, and the current check only looks for an exact match. This causes the first failing test scenario.
2. In the case of checking for partitions, the constructed `stdout` contains partition details, and the function attempts to match exact strings with the partition spec, leading to failure in the second set of failing test scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the existing conditional blocks to correctly check for table existence by comparing with each line of `stdout`.
2. Adjust the partition command generation to construct the partition properly before executing the hive command.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{0} = "{1}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting `stdout` on newlines and checking each line separately for the table name, we ensure a more robust table existence check. Additionally, by properly constructing the partition string with correct formatting, the function can accurately verify the existence of partitions.
