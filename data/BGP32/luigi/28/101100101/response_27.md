The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks whether the table exists in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation does not handle cases where the table name is included within another string in the stdout, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check for the exact match of the table name in each line of the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version handles the cases where the table name may be surrounded by other characters in the stdout. It checks for the exact match of the table name in each line of the stdout to determine if the table exists.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
