### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is trying to check if a table exists in a given database using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. There are two main issues with the function:
1. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect as `stdout` is always a string, and it will always evaluate to `True`. This causes the first test case to fail.
2. In the second part of the function (checking for partition existence), the `stdout` is being checked directly, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug
The buggy function has logic issues in both the if-else branches, causing incorrect evaluations and failing the test cases.

### Fix
1. Correct the condition to check if the table exists by ensuring that the table name is present in the `stdout` output.
2. Refactor the function to explicitly check for the existence of partitions and compare them correctly.

### Updated Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(partition_str in part for part in partitions)
``` 

After applying these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify table and partition existence and pass all the test cases.
