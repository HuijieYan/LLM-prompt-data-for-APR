### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in the given database. If a partition is provided, it should also check if the specific partition exists for that table.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition where the function checks if the table exists in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not properly evaluate the output from `run_hive_cmd` to accurately determine if the table exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` to correctly identify the presence of the table.

### Bug Fix
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show tables '%s' partition %s;""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the query in the second part of the function to check for tables instead of partitions and correcting the formatting of the query string, we ensure that the function accurately detects the presence of the table. This fix should address the bug and make the function pass all the test cases.
