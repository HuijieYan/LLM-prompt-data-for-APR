### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing table names.
2. The issue arises due to case sensitivity in comparing the table name from the database output to the input table name in the function.
3. In the failing tests, the expected behavior is for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive, but the current implementation is case sensitive, leading to failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive.
5. The correction involves converting both the input table name and the database table name to lowercase before comparing them.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function to compare the lowercase versions of the table names, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This change aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, making the function more robust in handling variations in table name casing.
