### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to query Hive for information.
2. The bug occurs when the function compares the table name with the output received from Hive without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases indicate that when the table name mismatches in terms of case with the output from Hive, the function fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name to the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives when the table names don't match due to case differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to a common case (e.g., lowercase or uppercase) before comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code addresses the bug by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and fixes the issue reported in GitHub.
