### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file fails to correctly handle case sensitivity, leading to test failures related to case-insensitive comparisons.
2. The failing tests in `hive_test.py` demonstrate scenarios where the function fails to return the expected results due to case-sensitive comparisons.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid failures caused by case mismatches in table names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function not performing case-insensitive comparisons between the table names provided as input and those retrieved from Hive. This results in test failures when the actual table names returned from Hive do not match the casing of the input table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, modify the comparison between the table names by converting both names to lowercase before comparison. This approach ensures that the function can handle case variations between input and retrieved table names correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected function now performs case-insensitive checks when verifying table existence. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
