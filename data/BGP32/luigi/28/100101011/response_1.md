### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks if the provided table exists in the database by running Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names, causing the tests to fail.
3. The failing test cases cover scenarios where the table name is in different cases, and the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
4. The relevant GitHub issue #896 and its description clarify that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Error location:
The bug lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands, which is not accounting for case sensitivity.

### Bug cause:
The function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity. As a result, when the table name in the output is in a different case than the provided table name, the comparison fails, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive when checking for table existence:
1. Lowercase both the `table` name and the `stdout` output before comparison.
2. Update the function to return `True` if the lowercased `table` is found in the lowercased `stdout`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function to compare lowercase versions of the table name and the Hive command output, the function should now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests.
