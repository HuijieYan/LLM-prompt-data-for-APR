### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a Hive database based on the provided table name and database. The issue described on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive.
2. The buggy function compares the table name as is, leading to case sensitivity issues.
3. The failing test cases show that the function fails to return the correct result when the table name cases don't match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function will involve converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results and failing tests when the cases do not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making the comparison case-insensitive (by converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase), the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised in GitHub.
