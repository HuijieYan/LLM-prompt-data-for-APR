### Error Locations:
1. The `if` condition for checking table existence is case-sensitive since it directly compares the table name with the entries in `stdout`.
2. The code does not consider case insensitivity while determining table existence in the Hive database.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the `table_exists` function's lack of case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The function compares the provided table name directly with the output received from the Hive command without considering case differences. This issue causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases (uppercase vs lowercase) as the comparison fails in those instances.

### Fix Strategy:
To correct the bug and fulfill the GitHub issue request, we need to implement a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the entries in the `stdout`. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the entries in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name (`table`) and the entries in `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the corrected function will now be case-insensitive, resolving the bug and enabling the function to pass the failing test cases associated with GitHub issues #896 and #897.
