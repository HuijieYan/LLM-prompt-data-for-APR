### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is designed to check if a table exists in a given Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the function should be case-insensitive to handle tables with different letter cases.
2. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` against the provided table name, leading to case sensitivity issues.
3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the table names in `stdout` is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the cases do not match. The function was not considering case insensitivity during the table existence check.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` case-insensitive by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the names in `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.
