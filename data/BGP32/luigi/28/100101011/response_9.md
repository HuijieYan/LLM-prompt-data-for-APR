### Error Location:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic when checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` returned from the Hive command. The comparison is case sensitive, causing test failures when checking for tables with different casing.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In cases where the table name provided is capitalized, such as 'MyTable', the returned `stdout` from Hive is all in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.
2. The current implementation of the function does a direct equality check between the provided `table` name and the `stdout`, which doesn't consider case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before doing the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
                        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparisons, the function will now check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
