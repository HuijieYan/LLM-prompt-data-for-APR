### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function originates from the case sensitivity in comparing the table name retrieved from the `stdout` with the provided `table` parameter. The function directly compares the table name without considering the case, leading to failing tests where the table names are different due to case differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the case sensitivity issue, the bug can be fixed by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This approach ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, aligning with the requirements outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with the necessary modifications for case insensitivity:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` strings to lowercase before performing the comparison, the function now correctly handles case insensitivity, resolving the failing tests associated with different cases of table names.
