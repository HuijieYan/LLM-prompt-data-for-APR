### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `hive.py` file is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function compares the table name from the input with the output from the Hive command without considering case differences.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function fails to correctly identify table existence due to case differences.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case-insensitive.
5. The GitHub issue also suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive command to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub and resolves the failing test cases.
