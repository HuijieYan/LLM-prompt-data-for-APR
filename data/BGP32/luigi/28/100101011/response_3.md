### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function has an issue where it is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table.
2. The failing test cases are designed to test the case sensitivity behavior.
3. The inputs and outputs provided in the failing test cases show that the function fails to correctly handle table names with different cases.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid such issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison in the `table_exists` function. It does not consider the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for existence, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout output is case insensitive. Converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison will address this issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now handle table names with different cases correctly, resolving the failing tests and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
