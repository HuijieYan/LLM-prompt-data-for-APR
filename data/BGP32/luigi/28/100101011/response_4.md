### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in Hive, handling cases where the table name may vary in capitalization.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and fetches the output to determine table existence.
3. The identified bug relates to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the provided table name.
4. The failing tests highlight scenarios where case sensitivity leads to incorrect results.
5. The provided GitHub issues propose making `table_exists` case-insensitive by comparing table names in lowercase.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is the lack of case insensitivity when comparing the table names in the `stdout` with the provided table names. This leads to incorrect results when the table names have different capitalization.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the case sensitivity issue, we should modify the comparison logic to compare the table names in lowercase. This adjustment will ensure that the function behaves in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())`, we ensure that both the table name and the tables in `stdout` are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

Once this corrected function is implemented, the failing tests related to case sensitivity should pass successfully.
