### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to determine the existence of a table in Hive, with an option to check for a specific partition as well. The issue arises due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. The function currently does a direct comparison without considering case differences, leading to failing tests, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison logic within the buggy function where it checks if the table exists by directly matching the name without considering case differences.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle case differences between the table name and the output from Hive commands. This lack of case insensitivity causes the tests to fail when the table names do not match case-wise.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider case differences. By converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence. This correction addresses the failing tests and resolves the issue of table name case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
