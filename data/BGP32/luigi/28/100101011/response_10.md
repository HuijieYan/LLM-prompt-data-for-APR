### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in the provided database by running a command and then comparing the output.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive to handle situations where the table names might have different cases between the function input and the actual table name in the database.

### Error location:
The bug arises from the function not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name with the output from the command.

### Bug Cause:
In the failing tests provided, the function checks if the table name is present in the output string received from the command. However, the function does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names, leading to failures for tables with different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To make the function case insensitive:
1. Convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.
2. Modify the function to return `True` if the lowercase `table` name is found in the lowercase `stdout`, indicating that the table exists irrespective of the case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now converts both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before checking if the table exists, making it case insensitive. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and should now pass the failing tests.
