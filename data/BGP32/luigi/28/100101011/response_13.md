### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has an issue where it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This issue is reflected in the failing test cases provided in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. The function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to ensure correct behavior.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect comparison of table names in the `stdout`.
2. Lack of handling case-insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the function's validation of table existence by directly comparing the input table name with output from Hive, which can vary in case if the table is defined differently. If tables in Hive are defined with different casing, the function fails to correctly identify the table's existence, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the check is not affected by the case of characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the outputs from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and the failing test cases, providing a more robust implementation.
