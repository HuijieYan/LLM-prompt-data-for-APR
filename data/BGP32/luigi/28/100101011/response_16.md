### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is checking the presence of a table in Hive by running a command and examining the output.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive in checking table names due to differences between uppercase and lowercase table names.
3. The bug occurs because the current implementation of the function directly compares the table name as is without considering case differences, leading to test failures when table names are in different cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the function's comparison of the table name without considering case sensitivity. When the table names in the test cases have different cases, the direct comparison fails, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues in table existence checks.
