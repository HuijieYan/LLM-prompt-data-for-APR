### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of table name case sensitivity - comparing table names without considering case.
2. Inconsistent handling of table names in the `table_exists` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the `table_exists` function not accounting for case sensitivity in the comparison between the table name provided and the table names retrieved from Hive. The function directly compares the `table` variable and `stdout`, leading to failures when the case doesn't match due to Hive's case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity, resolving the bug reported in GitHub. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub.
