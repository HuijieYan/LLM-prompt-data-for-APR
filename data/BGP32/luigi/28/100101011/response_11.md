### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database, but the comparison is case-sensitive.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` aims to test the case insensitivity of the table existence check but fails due to the case-sensitive comparison.
3. The provided test cases and descriptions from GitHub clearly outline the issue of case sensitivity when comparing table names in Hive.
4. The bug stems from not considering case insensitivity when comparing table names in the `stdout` result.
5. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from a case-sensitive comparison in the `table_exists` function, leading to failures in tests expecting case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing in the `table_exists` function to ensure a case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
``` 

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
