## Identified Bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly to the output from Hive, which may be in a different case. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases.

## Bug Explanation:

In the provided failing test cases and runtime information, we can see that the `table_exists` function is failing because it directly compares the table name to the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failures when the table names are in different cases.

## Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when comparing the table names with the output from Hive. By converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase), we can ensure a successful comparison.

## Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we convert both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and matches the expected behavior in Hive.

By making this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table name comparisons.
