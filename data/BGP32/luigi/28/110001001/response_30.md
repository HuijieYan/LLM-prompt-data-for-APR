### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

In the provided cases:
- Case 1: The table exist, but the function is returning `False`.
- Case 2: The table exists, but the function is returning `False`.
- Case 3: The table does not exist, but the function is returning `True`.
- Case 4: The table exists, but the function is returning `False`.

The issue indicates that the function is not correctly handling the output string from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine whether the table exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by how the function checks if `table in stdout` without considering the case sensitivity of the table names. In Case 2, the table name in the `stdout` is `'mytable'`, while the table name being checked is `'MyTable'`. This mismatch in case causes the function to incorrectly determine the existence of the table.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table names to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly determine the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.
