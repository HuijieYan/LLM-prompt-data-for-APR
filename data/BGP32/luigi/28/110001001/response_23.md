### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a given table exists in a Hive database. The issue seems to be with how the function is checking for the existence of the table by running hive commands and parsing the output.

### Bugs
1. The function is checking for the exact match of the table name in the output which is case-sensitive. This can lead to incorrect results when the case of the table name is different.
2. The function is not handling the case where the table name is the same as a substring of another table name, leading to false positives.

### Cause of the Bugs
1. In Case 2, the table name `'MyTable'` is being incorrectly identified as present in the database due to case mismatch.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the function incorrectly identifies the table name `'mytable'` as present in the database when it is actually a substring of another table name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs
1. Normalize the table names by converting them to lowercase before checking for existence to avoid case sensitivity issues.
2. Use a more robust method to verify the existence of the table instead of checking for exact matches in the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
    
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

In the corrected version:
- The table names are normalized to lowercase before comparison to handle case insensitivity issues.
- The function now checks if the table name is present in the list of tables obtained from the Hive command output instead of checking for exact matches.
- The function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty (indicating the table/partition exists), and `False` otherwise.
