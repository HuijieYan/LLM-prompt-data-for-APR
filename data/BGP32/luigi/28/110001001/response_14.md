### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first case, the function checks if the table name is in the output, which is a proper approach. However, in the second case, the function checks if the output is not empty, rather than checking if the table name is in the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. We should check if the table name is in the output for both cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
```
