### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function causes it to incorrectly check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug arises from the condition being used to determine the existence of the table. In the buggy implementation, the function checks if the table name is present in the output of the Hive command, which can lead to incorrect results due to partial matches.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to parse the output of the Hive command more robustly and accurately determine the existence of the table. One way to achieve this is to split the output of the Hive command by newline characters and then check for an exact match of the table name.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures the function accurately checks if the table exists in the Hive database by performing a more precise match with the table name in the output of the Hive command.
