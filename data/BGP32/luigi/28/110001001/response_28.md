### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking whether a table exists in a Hive database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises when checking for the table existence. In the case where a partition is provided, the function constructs the command incorrectly, leading to potential errors. 

### Bug Cause
1. In the case where a partition is provided, the command constructed in the `else` block is missing the actual table name, leading to incorrect results.
2. The comparison logic in the `if stdout` condition might not be reliable for checking if a table exists.

### Fix
1. Correct the construction of the command to include the table name when a partition is provided.
2. Improve the logic to determine table existence by explicitly checking for the table name in the output of the Hive command.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                {2}""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout
``` 

This corrected version should handle the cases more accurately and return the correct results based on the provided input.
