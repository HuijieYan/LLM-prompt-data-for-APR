### Analysis
The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a specified database using Hive commands. The bug seems to be in the comparison logic, as it is not correctly handling the case where the table name might not match exactly due to case sensitivity.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive in Python. If the table name is not an exact match (e.g., different cases), it will return `False` incorrectly even if the table exists.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

This corrected version converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.
