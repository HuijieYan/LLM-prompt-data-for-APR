### Potential error locations:
1. In the first branch of the `if` statement, the condition for checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` might be problematic.
2. In the second branch of the `if` statement, the string formatting might not be correct when using `%s` placeholders.

### Cause of the bug:
1. In the first branch of the `if` statement, the comparison to check if the `table` is in the `stdout` is not handling the case where there might be multiple tables listed in the `stdout`.
2. In the second branch of the `if` statement, the string formatting using `%s` might be causing issues in forming the correct command to check for partitions.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison in the first branch to properly handle the case where there could be multiple tables listed in `stdout`.
2. Update the string formatting in the second branch to ensure the command generated correctly for checking partitions.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, table))
    
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the tables in the `stdout` when checking if the table exists, we can correctly handle cases where multiple tables are listed. Additionally, by adjusting the string formatting in the partition check command, we ensure that the partition check is done accurately.
