The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` output. The buggy function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output from the `hive` command by using the `in` operator. However, this comparison is case-sensitive, which causes issues when the case of the table name in the `stdout` output differs from the input table name.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case-insensitive, fixing the bug identified in the function.
