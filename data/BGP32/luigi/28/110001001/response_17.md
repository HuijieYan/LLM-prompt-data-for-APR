### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. However, there are issues with how the function is checking for the table's existence, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The `table` variable might not be compared correctly in the `stdout`.
2. The partition specification might not be correctly handled, leading to incorrect `stdout`.

### Cause of the Bug
- In Case 1 and Case 3, the buggy function returns incorrect results when checking for the presence of the table. The comparison of the `table` variable in the `stdout` is not correctly implemented.
- In Case 2 and Case 4, the buggy function fails to handle the table names correctly, leading to false negatives in the existence check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is done correctly in the `stdout` and that the partition specification is handled accurately.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` by newline character in cases where we are checking for table existence without partition.
- For cases where partition is specified, no changes are made as the issue did not arise from that part of the function.
