### Analysis
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a specified database and optionally with a specific partition.
- The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks the output to determine if the table exists.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking the table existence based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- In Case 1 and Case 3, the function should return `False` because the table does not exist, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
- In Case 2 and Case 4, the function should return `True` because the table does exist, but the current implementation does not correctly parse the output to determine the existence of the table.

### Bug Cause
- The bug stems from how the function is checking the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The function is currently doing a simple existence check of the table name in the output, which can lead to incorrect results due to case sensitivity and whitespace issues.
- The function does not handle the case where the table does not exist correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
- To address the bug, we need to refactor the function to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table.
- Additionally, we should handle the case where the table does not exist and return `False` accordingly.
- Consider case insensitivity and trimming whitespace from the output to ensure accurate results.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip()]
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return bool(stdout)
```
