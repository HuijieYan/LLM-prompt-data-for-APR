### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and checks the output to determine if the table exists.

#### Issues
1. In the case of `else` block, the Hive command being formed to show partitions has a missing column spec, which can lead to incorrect results.
2. The comparison of the table name with the `stdout` output is done without considering case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results on case-sensitive systems.

### Bug Cause
1. In the else block, the Hive command to show partitions is missing the column specification, resulting in incomplete query execution.
2. When comparing the table name with `stdout`, case sensitivity is not considered, leading to false negatives if the case of the table name in the output differs.

### Proposed Fix
1. To fix the missing column spec issue, add the partition spec to the Hive command in the else block.
2. To address the case sensitivity problem, convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
