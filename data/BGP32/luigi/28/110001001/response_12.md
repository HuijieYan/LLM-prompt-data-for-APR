### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database, with optional partition information. However, the bug seems to be related to how the function processes the `stdout` output from running the Hive commands.

### Error Location
The bug is likely in the conditional checks after running the Hive commands, where the function is not correctly processing the output to determine if the table exists.

### Cause of the Bug
- In Case 1 and Case 3, even if the table does exist (`table in stdout`), the function returns `False` due to the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, which is incorrect for checking table existence.
- In Case 2 and Case 4, the function does not handle the case where the table name casing might affect the comparison (e.g., `'MyTable'` vs. `'mytable'`).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the condition for checking table existence to properly handle the presence of the table in the output.
2. Normalize the table names before comparison to avoid issues related to casing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table.lower() in stdout.lower() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for case-insensitive comparison to address the potential casing issue.
- The return statements are adjusted to correctly handle the presence of the table in the output.

By making these changes, the function should now properly determine if a table exists in the specified database.
