### Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` output. In the first condition, the comparison is case-sensitive, which can lead to incorrect results when the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with the table names retrieved from Hive. The second condition is not properly parsing the output to check if the table or partition exists.

### Bug Cause
1. In the first part of the function, `table in stdout` is a case-sensitive comparison that can fail if the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with the output.
2. The second part of the function is not parsing the output correctly to check if the table or partition exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the comparison in the first condition to make it case-insensitive.
2. Adjust the logic in the second condition to properly parse the output to check for the existence of the table or partition.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Check if a result is returned and contains the partition
        if stdout.lower().find(table.lower()) != -1:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version uses case-insensitive comparisons for table names and properly checks the output to determine the existence of the table or partition.
