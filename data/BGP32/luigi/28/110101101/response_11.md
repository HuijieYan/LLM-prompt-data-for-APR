### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to how the function checks for the table existence in the provided database. The function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists or not.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the output and determine if the table exists based on that.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table).replace('"', '\\"'))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
    
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
    
            return bool(partitions)

```

By splitting the `stdout` by the new line character, we now have a list of tables or partitions which we can check to see if the table in question exists. This should fix the bug and the function should now correctly check for table existence.
