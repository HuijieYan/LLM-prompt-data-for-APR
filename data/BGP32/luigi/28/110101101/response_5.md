### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists by running a Hive command.
- The bug seems to be in the conditional check of the returned `stdout` which is not handled correctly.
- In the failing tests, the function fails to return the correct boolean value based on the existence of the table.
- The function should return `True` if the table exists in the output and `False` otherwise. However, it is not handling the output properly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking the presence of the table in the output of the Hive command.
- The function only checks whether the `stdout` is non-empty to determine the existence of the table. This does not account for the actual contents of the `stdout`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the conditional checks on the `stdout` variable to properly check if the table name exists in the `stdout`.
- Update the function to return `True` if the table name is found in the `stdout`, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout
```

By fixing the conditional check to properly verify the presence of the table in the `stdout`, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
