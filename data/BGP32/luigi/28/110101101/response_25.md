The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if a table exists is incorrect. The function is returning `True` if the result is not an empty string, which is incorrect since the table may not be found in the list of tables returned.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if the table is in the list of tables returned by the `SHOW TABLES` query in Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by the newline character and checking if the `table` is in the list of tables returned, we ensure that the function correctly determines if a table exists or not.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
