### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. In the first case, the function incorrectly checks if the table name is in the `stdout` output directly, which can lead to false positives. In the second case, the function fails to properly parse the table names from the `stdout` output before comparison, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the table names from the `stdout` output before comparing them with the input table name. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` string into lines and then checking if the table name is in the list of tables obtained from `stdout`.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string into lines and checking if the table name is in the resulting list, we ensure a more accurate comparison and address the issues present in the original buggy function.
