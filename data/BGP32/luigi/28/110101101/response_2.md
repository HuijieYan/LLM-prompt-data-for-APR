### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the logic to check if a table exists is incorrect. In the first part of the function, it checks if the table name is in the output of the Hive command, which is correct. However, in the else part of the function where it checks for partitions, it always returns `True` if the `stdout` variable is not empty. This is incorrect as it should only return `True` if the specific partition is found in the output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the else part of the function to properly check for the existence of the specified partition. We can compare the partition specification obtained using `self.partition_spec(partition)` with the output of the Hive command to determine if the partition exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return any(partition in line for line in stdout.split('\n') if line)
```

By utilizing the corrected logic above, the `table_exists` function should now properly verify the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive database.
