### Analysis:
1. The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks if the `stdout` is not empty. It currently returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, even if the `table` is not in it. This is causing the test cases to fail.
2. The function is not handling the case-insensitivity mentioned in the test cases.
3. The function is not correctly checking for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout` output.
4. The function does not handle the partition case properly, leading to incorrect returns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function stems from how it handles the `stdout` output from the Hive commands. It simply checks if `stdout` is not empty, which does not necessarily indicate the presence of the `table` or correct partition information. Additionally, the function does not account for case-insensitive comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition checking to ensure that the `table` exists in the `stdout` output rather than just checking if the output is not empty.
2. Add a case-insensitive comparison for checking the presence of the `table`.
3. Modify the partition conditions to accurately handle the partition information.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip().lower() == table.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
``` 

This corrected version performs a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout`. Additionally, it handles the partition case more accurately.
