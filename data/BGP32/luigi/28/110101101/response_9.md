### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the returned `stdout` variable. The function incorrectly assumes that if `stdout` is not empty, then the table exists. This assumption is incorrect because the output might contain other tables as well, leading to a false positive result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the table exists. We should split the `stdout` variable by newline characters and then check if the specific table is present in the list of tables returned.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable into lines and checking if the specific table is in the list, we can accurately determine if the table exists in the database. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
