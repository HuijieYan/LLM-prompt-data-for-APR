### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a table in the `stdout` string received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects a specific format in the `stdout` string to confirm the existence of the table, which is not handled correctly leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the following conditional statement:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
and
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` string. The function expects the `stdout` string to contain the table name in a specific format to confirm its existence. When the string does not match this specific format, the function fails to correctly identify the table's existence.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check for the table's existence based on the expected format of the `stdout` string. We should also consider case insensitivity for table names to ensure accurate results.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the function to split the `stdout` string and check for the table's existence case-insensitively, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's presence. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
