The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect check on the `stdout` variable which does not properly handle different cases, leading to inconsistent behavior. The function incorrectly returns the value directly based on whether `stdout` is empty or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout` output. We can split the `stdout` output by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return bool(partitions)  # Check if partitions exist
```

By modifying the function as shown above, it should now correctly handle the presence of the table/partition name in the `stdout` output. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases you provided.
