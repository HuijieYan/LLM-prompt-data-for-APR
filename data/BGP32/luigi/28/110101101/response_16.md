### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database. It uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and determine the existence of the table.
2. The bug seems to be in the conditional checks for the stdout value after running the Hive commands in both branches of the if-else statement.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results based on the condition checks of the stdout value obtained from the Hive command execution.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditional checks on the `stdout` value are correctly implemented, considering both cases where the stdout value might contain the table name or partition details.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and 'OK' in stdout

# Explanation:
# - In the first branch (when partition is None), we split the stdout by '\n' after executing the show tables command to correctly check if the table name exists in the stdout.
# - In the second branch (when partition is not None), we check if `'OK'` is present in the stdout after executing the show partitions command to determine if the partition exists.
