## Bug Explanation
The issue in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `table in stdout` condition. When the output (`stdout`) contains additional information along with the table name, such as a new line character, the equality check fails. This results in incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table names in `stdout` correctly. We should check if the table name is present as a separate word in the output, which requires splitting the output by newline characters and then performing the check.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters before checking for the table's presence, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
