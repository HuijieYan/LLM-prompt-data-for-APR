The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect comparison of the table name in the `stdout`. The function checks if the entire table name is present in the `stdout`, which causes issues with case sensitivity. To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of the table name as a separate word in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split("\n"))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version uses the `any` function to check if the `table` string is present as a separate word in the `stdout` by splitting the `stdout` lines.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
