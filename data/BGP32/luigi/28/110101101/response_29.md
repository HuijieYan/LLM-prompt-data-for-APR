### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists by running a hive command and comparing the output. There are two issues in the function:
- In the first if condition, the check for existence is incorrect as it only checks if the `stdout` exists, not specifically for the table.
- In the second part, when a partition is provided, the way the `stdout` is checked if True is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first part of the function, for Case 1 and Case 3, the function incorrectly returns True if `stdout` is not empty, which does not guarantee the table's existence.
2. In the second part of the function, for Case 3 and Case 6, the function incorrectly tries to match the entire response in the `stdout` variable with True instead of checking for the presence of the specific table in the output.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in both parts of the function. We should:
1. In the first part, explicitly check if the table name is present in the `stdout`.
2. In the second part, also check if the table name is present in the `stdout` when a partition is provided.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            return table in stdout
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table based on the provided inputs and pass the failing tests.
