The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking for the presence of the table in the stdout. The bug arises because the function checks if the table name is an exact match with the stdout, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if the table name is contained within the stdout.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition `table in stdout` to `table in stdout.split()` to account for cases where the table name might appear in a multi-line output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly check if the table exists in the stdout, addressing the bug and passing the failing test cases.
