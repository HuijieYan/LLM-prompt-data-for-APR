### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is comparing the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is causing the bug.
2. The bug is primarily in the comparison logic of whether the table exists or not.
3. The bug occurs because the function is checking for exact string match of the table name in the output, but in the second test case, the table name is appended after a newline character, causing the comparison to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to split the stdout based on newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any of the lines.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output on newline characters and then performing the comparison for table existence, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
