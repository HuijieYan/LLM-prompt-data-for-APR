### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with the comparison logic. It incorrectly checks if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function returns `True` only if the `stdout` variable is not empty, but it should actually check if the table name is present in the output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly verifies the existence of the table by just checking if the output is not empty, rather than looking for the specific table name in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should search for the exact table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will ensure that the function accurately determines if the table exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```

By splitting the `stdout` output into lines and checking if the table name is present in those lines, the corrected function will accurately determine if the table exists. This change addresses the bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected.
