### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the tests to fail. The function is not correctly checking whether a table exists in the specified database by running Hive commands and parsing the output.

In the failing tests, the function incorrectly returns `False` even when the table exists, leading to assertion errors.

1. In Case 1:
    - The function receives the table name 'mytable' and database 'default'.
    - The `stdout` variable contains 'OK', indicating that the table check command was successful.
    - Despite receiving a successful response, the function returns `False`, causing the test to fail.

2. In Case 2:
    - The function receives the table name 'MyTable' and database 'default'.
    - The `stdout` variable contains 'OK\nmytable', showing that the table 'mytable' exists in the database.
    - Despite finding the table, the function returns `False`, leading to a failed test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly interprets the output from the Hive command and accurately determines whether the table exists. Additionally, we should check for case insensitivity in table names as indicated in the test.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

The corrected version of the function includes:
- Using `show tables in <database>` to list tables in the specified database.
- Converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- Checking if the table name is present in the output by splitting on newline characters.
- Returning `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

This updated version should fix the bug and pass the failing tests.
