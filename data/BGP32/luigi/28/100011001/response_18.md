### Bug Analysis
The bug in the function `table_exists` is related to the way it checks if a table exists in the database. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't. In the failing test cases, the function is incorrectly returning `False` when it should return `True`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the conditional checks that determine the return value of the function. In both cases, the function is incorrectly returning `False` when the table actually exists.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if the table exists. In both cases, the method of checking for the existence of the table is not working as expected.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the function to correctly interpret the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine if the table exists. We need to adjust the comparisons and conditions to accurately reflect the presence of the table in the database.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout
```

By making the adjustments as shown above, the function should now correctly determine if the table exists in the database based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
