### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks for the table existence in the `stdout` of the command output. The function checks if the table name is included in the output string, but the check is not case-insensitive. This causes the function to fail when the case of the table name in the output does not match the case of the input table name.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before doing the comparison, making it case-insensitive. This modification ensures that the function will work correctly even when the case of the table name in the output does not match the case of the input table name.
