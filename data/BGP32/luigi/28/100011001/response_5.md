### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists. The function is using the `table in stdout` check, which is case sensitive. However, in the failing test cases, the `table` parameter is passed with different cases ("mytable" and "MyTable"), causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to make the table comparison case-insensitive. One way to do this is by converting both the `table` and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table name.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table being checked and the names in `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This correction should make the `table_exists` function work correctly with tables specified in different cases.
