### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the provided code is incorrectly checking for the presence of the table in the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug seems to be related to the condition checking `return stdout and table in stdout`, as the incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` content is leading to failing test cases.

### Bug
The bug is in the condition check `return stdout and table in stdout`. This check will fail in cases where the expected table name is in a new line after the "OK" string in the `stdout`. The current implementation of the function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the failing test cases.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` output. We should split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any of the lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation
In the corrected version:
- For the case where partition is None, we split the `stdout` by newline characters and check if the `table` exists in any of the lines. This covers the scenario where the table name appears in a new line.
- For cases where a partition is involved, we simply return `bool(stdout)` since the presence of any text in `stdout` indicates that the table exists. This simplifies the condition check and improvement readability.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly identify the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, passing the failing tests.
