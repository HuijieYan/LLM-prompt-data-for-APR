### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It makes a Hive command call based on whether a partition is specified or not. From the failing test cases, we can see that the function is not handling the case-insensitivity of the table name correctly, leading to failed assertions.

The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-sensitive. This causes the function to incorrectly handle cases where the table name is provided in a different case than the actual table name in the Hive database.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version should now pass the failing test as it can correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons.
