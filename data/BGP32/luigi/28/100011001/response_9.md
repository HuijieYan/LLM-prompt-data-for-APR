### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests due to incorrect comparison logic. In the first case, the function returns `stdout and table in stdout`, which is incorrect because `'OK' and table in 'OK'` will evaluate to True even though 'table' is not actually in the output. Similarly, in the second case, the function returns `stdout`, which is also incorrect as it will always evaluate to True regardless of the presence of 'table' in 'stdout'.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the 'table' is present in the 'stdout' and not just whether 'stdout' is present. We can achieve this by splitting the 'stdout' on newline characters (`\n`) and checking if 'table' is in the resulting list of strings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
``` 

By using the corrected version above, the function should now pass the failing tests, correctly checking if the 'table' exists in the 'stdout' output.
