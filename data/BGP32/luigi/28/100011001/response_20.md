### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function is checking for the presence of a table in a Hive database. In the first condition, the function runs a Hive command to show tables in the given database matching the provided table name. In the second condition, it runs a command to show partitions of the table.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks and processes the output from the Hive commands to determine the existence of a table.

3. From the failing tests:
    - In Case 1, the first condition should return False because `'OK'` is not equal to the expected output.
    - In Case 2, the second condition should return True because the table is present in the stdout.
    - In both cases, the buggy function is not processing the stdout correctly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from the Hive commands to determine if a table exists.

### Bug Fix
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            if table in stdout:
                return True
            return False
        else:
            return False
```

By properly checking if the `table` is in the `stdout` for the second condition, we ensure that the function returns the correct boolean value indicating the existence of the table.
