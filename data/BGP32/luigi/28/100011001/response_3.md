### Bug Analysis
The issue in the buggy function arises from the way it checks if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly determine the existence of a table in certain scenarios, leading to failing test cases. The primary cause of the bug lies in how the function processes the output received from the Hive commands.

1. In Case 1, the function receives 'OK' as the output from the Hive command, which indicates that the table 'mytable' exists. However, the function incorrectly returns `False`.
   
2. In Case 2, the function receives 'OK\nmytable' as the output from the Hive command, indicating that the table 'mytable' exists. However, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

3. In Case 3, the function receives 'OK' as the output from the Hive command, indicating that the table 'mytable' exists. However, the function incorrectly returns `False`.
   
4. In Case 4, the function receives 'OK\nmytable' as the output from the Hive command, indicating that the table 'mytable' exists. However, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify how the function processes the output of the Hive command. The function should correctly interpret the output to determine if the table exists in the database. Additionally, it should handle scenarios where the output contains both 'OK' and the table name.

### Corrected Function

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if partition:
            partition_string = 'partition (%s)' % self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s %s""" % (database, table, partition_string))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function now properly handles scenarios where the output of the Hive command contains information about table existence. It also correctly processes the partition information if provided. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct result in all cases.
