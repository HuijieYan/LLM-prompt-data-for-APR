### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not handling the case insensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in the database.
- The failing test in the GitHub issue is failing because the function does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names returned by Hive.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function not converting the table name to lowercase when checking for its existence in the database.
- When the `table_exists` function compares the input table name against the tables retrieved from the database, it fails if there is a case difference.
- Hive is case insensitive, so table names are returned in lowercase, leading to failures in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table names to lowercase before comparing them.
- This will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence, aligning with the behavior of Hive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Update:
- The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the input table name and the tables retrieved from the database to lowercase before comparison.
- This ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.
- The corrected version will pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub.
