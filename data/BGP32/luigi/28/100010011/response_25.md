### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test due to case sensitivity in table name comparison.
- The test is expecting a case-insensitive comparison, but the buggy function is doing a case-sensitive comparison causing the test to fail.
- The cause of the bug is that the function is not converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase for comparison.
- The GitHub issues highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` result to lowercase before comparison.
- Implement a case-insensitive comparison to resolve the failing test and adhere to the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

### Updated Function Explanation:
- Modified the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.
- In the if condition, `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used for case-insensitive comparison.
- Removed the redundant check for `stdout` in the else condition and directly converted the condition to a boolean value using `bool(stdout)`.
- The corrected version should now pass the failing test and be case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.
