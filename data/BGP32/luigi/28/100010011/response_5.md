### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database, accounting for case sensitivity.
2. The failing test cases are checking for table existence with different case variations.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking against lowercase versions of the table name and the command output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case insensitivity properly. The function compares the table name directly with the output, leading to failures when case variations are present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase for comparison. This adjustment will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
- Convert both the `table` and the contents of the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- Check if the lowercase version of the `table` is present in the lowercase version of the `stdout` to ensure case insensitivity.
- This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue to address the case insensitivity concern.

By implementing the corrected function, the `table_exists` method should now handle case insensitivity properly, passing the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue.
