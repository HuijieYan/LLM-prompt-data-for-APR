### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it does not take case sensitivity into account when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the table name in a lowercase format.
4. The bug is caused by the mismatch in case sensitivity between the table name provided and the table name returned by Hive. This results in the test case failing when it expects a case-insensitive comparison.
5. To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the provided table name and the tables returned by Hive to the lowercase format for consistent case-insensitive checking.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert both the provided table name and tables returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison, the bug related to case sensitivity is resolved. This fix ensures that the function performs a case-insensitive check for table existence, allowing the test cases to pass successfully.
