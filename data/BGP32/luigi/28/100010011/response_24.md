### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The failing tests are due to incorrect comparison of the table name.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the first part of the `if` condition, the comparison of `table in stdout` should be made case-insensitive.
2. In the second part of the function where the partition information is checked, a similar case-insensitive comparison should be applied.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the failure to handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names returned by Hive against the table name provided. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the function should perform case-insensitive comparisons to accommodate varying cases in table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to perform case-insensitive comparisons between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```

By changing the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure case-insensitive matching of table names, resolving the issue reported on GitHub. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests provided in the GitHub issue.
