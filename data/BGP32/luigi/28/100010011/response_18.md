### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that when checking for table existence, the function fails to recognize the table due to case mismatch.
- The GitHub issues (#896 and the related issue) highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to properly handle table names that might have different cases.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function not converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command.
- This leads to a false negative when checking for table existence because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the Hive output are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- We can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them to determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
- The corrected version of the function converts both the table name (`table`) and the output from the Hive command (`stdout`) to lowercase before performing the comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue of failing to recognize table names with different cases.
- The function now correctly handles table existence checks for case-insensitive table names, as requested in the GitHub issues.

By implementing the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the bug causing the failing test should be resolved, and the function should now pass the test case successfully.
