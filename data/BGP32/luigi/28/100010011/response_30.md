### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The error message indicates that the test case is failing when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The GitHub issue also highlights the case sensitivity problem and suggests fixing it by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of stdout.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect comparison between the table name and stdout.
- Missing handling of case sensitivity in table existence check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling the case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names can be returned in lowercase, leading to the test failures because the function compares them directly without considering case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, as requested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is performed in a case-insensitive manner. This modification aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing test cases related to table existence checks.
