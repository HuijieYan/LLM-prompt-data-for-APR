### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file is not checking for case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the `stdout` received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This is causing the test cases to fail when trying to check for table existence with different capitalization.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive, leading to test failures.
2. The function is not handling case sensitivity as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the lack of case insensitivity handling in the `table_exists` function when comparing the table name to the `stdout` response from Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` response to lower case before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and address the issue raised in the GitHub threads.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary:
By modifying the function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` response to lower case before comparing them, the case-sensitive issue will be resolved. The corrected version will pass the failing test cases and align with the fix suggested in the GitHub issues mentioned.
