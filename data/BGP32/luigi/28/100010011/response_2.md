### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists()` is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning False when it should be returning True due to case sensitivity issues.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` is not case insensitive, leading to incorrect results.
2. When checking for partitioned tables, the comparison is being made without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists()` not handling case sensitivity properly. The function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to avoid issues with the table name being returned in a different case from what was provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between `table` and `stdout` to be case insensitive. One way to do this is by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the strings.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This change will address the issue reported in the failing tests and the corresponding GitHub issues.
