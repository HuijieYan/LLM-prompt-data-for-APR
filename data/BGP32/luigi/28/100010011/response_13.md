### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database. The failing test cases in the GitHub issue indicate that the function is not returning the correct result when the table name's case does not match exactly.

### Error Location:
- The bug is in the comparison part of the function, where `table` is compared with `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the function not converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison fails when the cases do not match exactly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The fix involves converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparing them to make the comparison case insensitive.
- To resolve the issue, the function should always convert the table name to lowercase for comparison with the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)

```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.
