### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in the database. It is comparing the table names directly without considering case differences.
2. The failing test indicates that the current implementation is failing for case-sensitive table name comparisons, leading to assertion errors.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive for table name comparisons.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would be to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison in order to handle case insensitivity correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Converted both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing in the `table_exists` function.
2. Used `bool(stdout)` directly to get True/False based on the presence of stdout, which simplifies the code.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should handle table name comparisons in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the assertion errors from the failing tests.
