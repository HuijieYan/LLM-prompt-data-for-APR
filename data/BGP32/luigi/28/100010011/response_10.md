### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues. The function does not check the case of the table names when comparing.
2. The error messages indicate that the test cases are failing because the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly.
3. The GitHub issue and description suggest that the function should be case insensitive when checking table names against stdout from Hive commands.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Correction:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue.
