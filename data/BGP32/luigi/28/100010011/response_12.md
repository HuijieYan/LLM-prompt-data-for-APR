### Analysis:
The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function `table_exists` does not take into account the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test cases when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in case sensitivity between the table name provided and the table name returned by Hive. The function does a direct comparison without considering case differences, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
