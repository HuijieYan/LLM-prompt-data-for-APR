### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the database.
2. The error messages from the failing test show that the function is returning incorrect results when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity.
3. The GitHub issue confirms that this is a known problem and suggests a solution to make the table check case insensitive.
4. The current implementation of the function does not account for case differences, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function and make it case insensitive:
1. Lowercase both the table name and the output from the `show tables` or `show partitions` command before comparison. This will ensure that case differences are ignored.
2. Modify the `table_exists` function to correctly handle case insensitivity in table checking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By making the comparison case insensitive with `lower()` conversion, the corrected `table_exists` function will now properly handle table existence checks regardless of case differences.
