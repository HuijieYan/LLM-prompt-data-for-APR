### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison ```table in stdout``` or ```self.partition_spec(partition)``` might be case-sensitive causing the test failures.
2. There is no handling for case sensitivity in the current implementation of the `table_exists` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The error message details two failing tests where the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing. The tests are checking the `table_exists` function of a HiveCommandClientTest class, which should return True when a table exists. The bug seems to be caused by a case sensitivity issue in comparing the table names. Hive is case-insensitive, so a table named 'mytable' would be returned as 'mytable' in stdout, but the current implementation of the function does not take case sensitivity into account, leading to failed assertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that case sensitivity is handled correctly when checking table existence. We can convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive, resolving the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
