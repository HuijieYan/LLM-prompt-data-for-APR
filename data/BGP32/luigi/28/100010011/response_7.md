### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in Hive. The issue arises when the table names are compared without considering case sensitivity.
2. The failing test asserts that the function should return `True` when checking for a table that exists, even if the case of the table name is different.
3. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without converting them to a common case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to a common case.
5. The corrected function will convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive when checking for table existence, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
