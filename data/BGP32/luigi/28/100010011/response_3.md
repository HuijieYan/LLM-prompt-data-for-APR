### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function currently checks if the table name is exactly present in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to case-sensitive comparisons. The failing test cases are due to the discrepancy in case between the expected table name and the actual output.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not considering case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function directly compares the table name with the output, leading to failures when there are case differences.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the output to lower case (or upper case) before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the failing test cases and the related GitHub issue.
