### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive.
- The failing test is checking for the table existence based on different cases, leading to failed assertions.

### Error Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not handling case sensitivity properly. The function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive without converting it to lowercase. This leads to failed assertions when the case of the table name differs from the case in the Hive output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.
- This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the issue raised in the GitHub discussions.

By making this change, the function can now properly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
