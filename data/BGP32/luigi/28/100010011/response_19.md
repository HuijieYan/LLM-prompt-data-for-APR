### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case insensitivity while comparing the table name against the output from the Hive command.
2. The failing test in GitHub is indicating that the function is not returning the correct result when the table names are in different cases.
3. The issue reported on GitHub also highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
4. The existing implementation of the function does not lower the table name before comparing it with the output from Hive, causing case sensitivity issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case insensitivity correctly. It is directly comparing the table name without lowercasing it, leading to false positives or negatives based on the case of the table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is lowercased before comparing it with the output from Hive. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issues identified in the failing tests and GitHub reports.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By lowercasing both the table name and the output from Hive before comparison, we ensure that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive and will return the correct result. This corrected version addresses the bug reported in the failing tests and GitHub issues.
