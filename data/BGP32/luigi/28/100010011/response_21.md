### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Error Message:

The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue reported in GitHub highlights that the function should be case-insensitive when comparing the table name to the output received from Hive, as Hive returns table names in lowercase.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to failed assertions when comparing table names.

### Potential Error Locations:

1. The comparison between the `table` variable and the `stdout` output is likely causing the test failures.
2. The function does not perform case-insensitive comparison, leading to assertion failures.

### Cause of Bug:

The bug in the function is due to the fact that the function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive. Since Hive returns table names in lowercase, a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity will result in incorrect comparisons and failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, the `table` variable should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` output in a case-insensitive manner. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the input table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This change ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing tests.
