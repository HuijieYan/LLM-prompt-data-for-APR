### Analysis:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
- The failing test cases in the GitHub issue clearly demonstrate the problem where table names with different cases are not being recognized as existing tables.
- The issue suggests that the function should be modified to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase.
- Currently, the function only checks for an exact match, leading to failures when the cases do not match.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity.
- When a table name like "mytable" is returned as "MYTABLE" from Hive, the equality check fails because of case differences.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the Hive stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will make the function case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive, resolving the failing test cases and the GitHub issues related to case sensitivity.
