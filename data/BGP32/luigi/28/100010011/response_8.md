**Analysis:**

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file checks for the existence of a table in a given database. The issue reported on GitHub (#896) mentions that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table names due to Hive being case-insensitive.

**Error Location:**

The bug lies in the comparison of the `table` with the content of `stdout`. It fails to handle case-insensitivity, causing the test cases to fail when the table names are different cases.

**Bug Cause:**

The buggy function performs an exact match comparison between the `table` and the content of `stdout`. This comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the cases do not match due to Hive being case-insensitive. This bug contradicts the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` should be done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, `table.lower()` is compared with `stdout.lower()` to ensure a case-insensitive match. This change aligns with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue (#896) and should resolve the failing test cases.
