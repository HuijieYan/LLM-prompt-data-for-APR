The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for table existence, leading to test failures due to case mismatches between the provided table name and the actual table name in the `stdout`.

### Error Location:
The bug is in the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` variables without considering case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the `table` and `stdout` values. This causes the function to fail when the table names are provided in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and fulfill the expected behavior, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This adjustment aligns with the resolution requested in the GitHub issue and addresses the bug effectively.
