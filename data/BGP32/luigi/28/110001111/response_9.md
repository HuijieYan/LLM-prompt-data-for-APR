### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive.
2. The issue reported on GitHub is related to case sensitivity when comparing table names.
3. The bug occurs because the function is not handling case sensitivity properly. The function compares the table name as it is provided with the tables listed in stdout without considering case differences, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in stdout is case insensitive.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables listed in stdout to lowercase before comparing.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to use case-insensitive comparison for checking table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
