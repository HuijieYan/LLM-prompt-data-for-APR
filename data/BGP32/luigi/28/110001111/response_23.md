### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive` has an issue where it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering case differences. This causes failures when the table name cases do not match.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. When the table names differ in case, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (such as lowercase). This will ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case of the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
