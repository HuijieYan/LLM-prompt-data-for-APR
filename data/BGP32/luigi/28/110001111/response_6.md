### Issues:
1. The `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity, which causes the tests to fail when comparing table names.
2. The function does not handle partitioned tables correctly when checking for table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing table names. When checking for a table's existence, it directly compares the provided table name with the output from the query, leading to case mismatches. Additionally, the function does not handle partitioned tables properly, resulting in incorrect logic for checking their existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the query output to lowercase for better matching.
2. Improve the handling of partitioned tables to ensure the correct formation of the query and validation of their existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive check for table existence
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table_lower, partition_query))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version addresses the case sensitivity issue by converting both the provided table name and the query output to lowercase during comparison. It also enhances the handling of partitioned tables by properly constructing the partition query for validation.
