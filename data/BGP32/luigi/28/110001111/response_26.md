### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner, causing failures when table names are in different cases.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity in comparing table names extracted from Hive commands.
3. The bug causes test failures when comparing table names in different cases than expected due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of table names is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # can directly return the truth value of stdout

``` 

By converting both the table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly performs a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database.
