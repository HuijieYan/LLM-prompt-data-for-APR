### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This bug causes issues when comparing the table name provided with the actual tables in Hive, leading to test failures.

### Error Locations:
1. The function does not handle the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence.
2. The comparison between the table name and the tables received from the Hive query is not case insensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function compares the provided table name directly with the tables retrieved from Hive without considering the case of the names. This causes mismatches when the cases do not match, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before the comparison. This change will ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the tables received in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is now case insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
