### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to correctly check if a table exists in a database due to a case sensitivity issue.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command and then checks if the table name is present in the output.
3. The bug arises from the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command, where the case sensitivity causes failures in detecting existing tables.
4. We need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive to resolve the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This leads to false negatives in detecting existing tables due to case mismatches.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output is made case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before checking existence. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that table detection is not affected by case mismatches.
