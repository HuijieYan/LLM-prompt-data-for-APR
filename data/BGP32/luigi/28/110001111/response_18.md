The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function does not take into account that Hive is case insensitive, leading to failures when encountering differently-cased table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table. This change aligns with the reported GitHub issue and addresses the problem with case sensitivity in table name comparisons.
