Potential Error Locations:
1. In the comparison of the table name with the tables present in the stdout, there's a case mismatch due to capitalization differences.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the tables listed in stdout without considering case sensitivity. This results in failures when the table names are in different cases.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison between the table name and the tables in stdout to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and tables in stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected Version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the tables listed in stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This resolves the issue raised in the GitHub post.
