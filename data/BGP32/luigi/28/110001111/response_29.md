### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case-insensitive, causing issues when comparing table names in different cases.
2. The issue arises from performing a direct comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to prevent failures when dealing with table names in different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking if the table exists.
2. Ensure that the comparison is done with the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive commands.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### The corrected version of the function:
- Converts both the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison.
- Ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
