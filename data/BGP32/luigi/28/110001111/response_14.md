### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` currently checks for table existence in Hive but does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The issue arises when the table name is provided in a different case from the actual table name in Hive, causing the function to return incorrect results.
2. The problem lies in the comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive, where case sensitivity is not considered.
3. The bug is due to the fact that the function directly checks if the table name exists in the output from Hive without converting the table name to a consistent case format (e.g., lowercase) for comparison. This leads to incorrect detection of table existence, especially when the case of the table name does not match that of the output from Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we should convert both the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive to a consistent case format (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. This ensures that case differences do not affect the detection of table existence accurately.
5. The corrected version of the function should:
   - Modify the function to convert the provided table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the Hive output.
   - Also, convert the table names returned from Hive to lowercase before comparing with the provided table name for accurate detection of table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The provided table name `table` is converted to lowercase using `table.lower()`.
- The table names returned from Hive in `stdout` are split into a list and converted to lowercase using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`.
- Then, the function checks if the lowercase table name exists in the list of lowercase table names returned from Hive for accurate detection of table existence.

This corrected version resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures consistent table name comparison for accurate results.
