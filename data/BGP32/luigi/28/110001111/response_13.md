### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `HiveClient` has an issue where it does not consider case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The bug arises when comparing the table name with the output obtained from Hive, which may be in a different case (lowercase) causing the comparison to fail.
3. The GitHub issue and description highlight the problem - tables in Hive may have different case representations, and the function needs to be case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is lowercased before comparison with the stdout to handle the case insensitivity effectively.

### Correction strategy:
1. Lowercase the `table` parameter before comparing it with the output obtained from Hive.
2. This will ensure case insensitivity and correctly identify if the table exists regardless of its case.

### Corrected code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the HiveCommandClient class
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the corrected `table_exists` function will compare the lowercase versions of the `table` parameter and the stdout, ensuring that case sensitivity issues are resolved. This change aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue to make the function case insensitive.
