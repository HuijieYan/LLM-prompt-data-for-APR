### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a given table exists in the specified database while handling partitions if provided.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity in comparing the table name obtained from the Hive command output with the input table name.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle different capitalizations of table names.
4. The bug causes the function to fail for some cases where the input table name and the retrieved table name from Hive command output are not in the same case, resulting in incorrect evaluation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the input table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output are converted to a consistent case for comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to convert both the input table name and the table names obtained from Hive command output to lowercase for comparison.
2. Adjust the conditional checks to compare the lowercase table names to make the function case insensitive.
3. This modification will ensure that the function can correctly identify existing tables regardless of their capitalization.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, we address the case sensitivity issue that was causing the function to fail in certain scenarios. The function now converts both the input and output table names to lowercase for comparison, ensuring correct evaluation of table existence.
