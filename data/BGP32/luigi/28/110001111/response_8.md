### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises from case sensitivity as described in the GitHub issue.
2. The bug is caused due to a direct comparison between the table name and the query result containing the table names, leading to case sensitivity problems.
3. The function needs to be modified to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner to resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug: Modify the condition for checking table existence to use lowercase comparison to make it case-insensitive.
5. Updated Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())` for comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the reported issue on GitHub.
