Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime and expected values, the bug seems to be caused by a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name to the stdout output. The function is not handling the case sensitivity appropriately, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout output to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the check is not affected by the case of the characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this revision, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout output, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the case of the characters. This change addresses the issue reported on GitHub and aligns the function with the expected behavior.
