### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, leading to failures when the case of the table name and the output don't match.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the comparison step where `table in stdout` is used to determine if the table exists in the Hive database.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does a direct comparison between the input table name and the output from the Hive command, which may not match due to case sensitivity. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" 
                                     % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This change aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
