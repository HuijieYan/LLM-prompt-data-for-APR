### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity properly. It's attempting to check if a given table exists in the database by comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, causing issues when the table names have different cases.

### Potential Error
The main issue lies in the comparison statement where `table` is compared directly with `stdout`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this comparison can lead to failures due to case mismatch.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function is directly comparing the table name given as input with the actual table names returned from Hive, without considering case sensitivity. This results in false negatives when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the table name as returned by Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the provided table name and the table names from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both the provided table name (input) and the table names fetched from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using `map(str.lower, stdout)`.

By making this change, the function will now handle case sensitivity issues properly, ensuring accurate results when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
