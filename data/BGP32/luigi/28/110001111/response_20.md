The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering case differences, leading to test failures in scenarios where the table names are in different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This correction ensures that the comparison between the table name and the output is done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
