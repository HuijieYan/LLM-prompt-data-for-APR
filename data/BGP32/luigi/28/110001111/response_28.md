## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem when comparing table names due to Hive being case insensitive.
2. The bug arises from not handling the case sensitivity of table names when comparing them with the output from Hive commands.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when comparing table names that differ in case due to Hive returning lowercase names. The fix involves converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
4. To fix the bug, update the comparison in the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking existence.
5. The corrected version is provided below:

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output of Hive commands to lowercase before comparison, the fixed function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence as requested in the GitHub issue.
