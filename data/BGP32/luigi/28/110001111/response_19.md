## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of tables. The function compares the table name directly against the standard output returned from the Hive command, leading to inconsistencies due to case sensitivity.

## Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the comparison statement where the table name and the output are being checked for equality.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from a case sensitivity issue where the table names are not consistently compared, leading to failures when the names do not match case-wise.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison, making it case-insensitive. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that table existence checks are consistent across different naming conventions.
