### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the bug causes issues with case sensitivity in table names.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, leading to incorrect results when table names are not in the same case.
3. The bug arises because the comparison does not take case sensitivity into account, causing failures when there are case differences between the input table name and the output from Hive.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to convert both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the input table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing for existence.
2. Ensure that the comparison is case insensitive to prevent issues caused by different cases of table names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table names are converted to lowercase before comparing, ensuring a case-insensitive check for the existence of tables in Hive. This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub thread and should prevent failures due to case differences in table names.
