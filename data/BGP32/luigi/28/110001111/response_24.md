### Error Location:
The buggy function `table_exists` fails to account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. It directly compares the `table` variable with the output `stdout`, which can cause issues when the case of the table name does not match the case in the database.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison performed to check if the table exists. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table names can be returned in lowercase even if they were defined with different case. The function should perform a case-insensitive check to ensure accurate results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database.
