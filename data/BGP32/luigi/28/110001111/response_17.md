### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function currently compares the table name without considering case, leading to incorrect results.
2. The bug arises when the table name's case is different in the `table_exists` function and the actual table being checked in Hive.
3. The function should consider case insensitivity when verifying table existence, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. Comparing table names in a case-insensitive manner will resolve this issue.
4. A strategy to fix this bug involves modifying the comparison of `table` and `stdout` to be case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be able to handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive.
