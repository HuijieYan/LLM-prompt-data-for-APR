The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is caused by the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called within the `HiveCommandClient` class. The `run_hive_cmd` function is referenced without specifying that it belongs to the current class `HiveCommandClient`, which leads to a NameError. 

To fix the bug, we need to correctly reference the `run_hive_cmd` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class. This can be done by prefixing the function call with `self` to indicate that it is a method of the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Implementation of the run_hive_cmd function
        pass
```

In the corrected code snippet, the `run_hive_cmd` function is called using `self.run_hive_cmd` to ensure that the method is correctly accessed within the `HiveCommandClient` class. By making this change, the bug causing the NameError should be resolved.
