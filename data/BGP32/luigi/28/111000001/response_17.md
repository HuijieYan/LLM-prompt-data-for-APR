## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database with optional partition information. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.

## Identified issue:
The bug in the function `table_exists` lies in the way the Hive command is constructed and executed when a partition is provided. The `%s` placeholders are not correctly used in the command string.

## Cause of the bug:
When constructing the Hive command with a partition, the placeholders `%s` are not correctly replaced with the respective arguments `database`, `table`, and `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to use the correct syntax for string formatting in Python, either using the `format` method or f-strings. Ensure that the correct arguments are passed and replaced into the command string.

## Corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version above:
- Used f-strings for string formatting to correctly incorporate the variables.
- Replaced `%s` with the variables directly in the string.
- Used `bool(stdout)` to simplify the return statement.

This corrected version should resolve the bug in the `table_exists` function by correctly constructing and executing the Hive command.
