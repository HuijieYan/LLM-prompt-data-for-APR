## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output for table existence.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block might be incorrect.
2. The condition `if stdout` to check for table existence in the `else` block may not be reliable.

## Cause of the bug:
1. The formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block is incorrect, as it is missing a string formatting placeholder for the partition specification.
2. The condition `if stdout` in the `else` block does not directly indicate whether the table exists or not. It only checks if there was any output from the `run_hive_cmd`.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the formatting of the Hive command inside the `else` block to include the partition specification placeholder.
2. Update the condition for checking table existence using a more reliable approach.

## Corrected version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None and len(stdout.strip()) > 0
``` 

In this corrected version:
- The Hive command in the `else` block has been formatted correctly with placeholders for database, table, and partition specification.
- The condition for checking table existence in the `else` block now checks if the `stdout` is not `None` and contains some content after stripping whitespace. This ensures a more accurate check for table existence based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
