The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called without referencing it correctly within the `HiveCommandClient` class. 

To fix this bug, ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is correctly referenced within the `HiveCommandClient` class by either importing it or calling it with the correct scope.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By fixing the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is referenced within the `HiveCommandClient` class, the bug in the original function is resolved.
