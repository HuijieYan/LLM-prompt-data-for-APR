## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is attempting to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and parse the output to determine if the table exists.

## Issues:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called without specifying it as a member of the class, which might cause scope issues.
2. The condition for checking if the table exists based on the output of `run_hive_cmd` is not properly handling the response.
3. The Hive command used to check for partitioned tables is incorrect and needs to be adjusted.

## Bug Description:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the existence of a table. The function does not properly account for cases where the table is not found in the output, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the call to `run_hive_cmd` to be a member of the class `HiveCommandClient` to avoid scope issues.
2. Modify the condition for checking the existence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd` to handle cases where the table is not found correctly.
3. Adjust the Hive command used for checking partitioned tables to ensure it is valid and formatted properly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Implementation of run_hive_cmd - to be added here

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of partition_spec - to be added here

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `run_hive_cmd` function has been updated to be a member function of the class to prevent scope errors.
- The condition for checking the existence of the table in the output has been simplified and corrected.
- The `return` statement for the function is improved to return a boolean value directly based on the stdout.

By applying these fixes, the `table_exists` function should now work correctly in determining the existence of a table in the specified database.
