The potential bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called without reference to its class, causing it to potentially run with incorrect configurations or missing parameters.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called within the context of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This can be achieved by referencing the function as `self.run_hive_cmd` instead of `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By calling the `run_hive_cmd` function using `self.run_hive_cmd`, we ensure that the correct instance of the function is invoked within the context of the `HiveCommandClient` class. This should fix the bug and prevent potential errors related to calling the function outside of its class.
