```



## Analysis and Explanation

**Bug**: The bug in the original `table_exists` function lies in the incorrect formatting of the query string for the `stdout` in the case where `partition` is not None. The format string is not correctly formatted with the table name, database name, and partition spec. 

**Cause of the Bug**: 
1. When `partition` is not None, the `stdout` query is not formatted correctly using `"%s"`.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` may return an empty string, which evaluates to False, so using `if stdout` to check if stdout is not None is incorrect. 

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
1. Use proper string formatting with `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}` for `database`, `table`, and `self.partition_spec(partition)`.
2. Modify the return statement to properly handle the checking of the stdout to return `True` or `False` based on if `stdout` is not `None`.

The corrected version addresses these issues by fixing the string formatting and checking if `stdout` is not `None`.
