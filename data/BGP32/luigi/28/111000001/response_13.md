## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to be in the way the Hive command is constructed when checking for the existence of a table with a specific partition.

## Error Location:
The error appears to be in the construction of the Hive command in the else block when a partition is provided. The formatting of the command may not be correct, resulting in incorrect output.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function's else block constructs the Hive command with the partition specification using `%s`, which doesn't properly format the string.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly format the Hive command when a partition is provided by using the `.format()` method to construct the complete command string.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_command = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}'.format(database, table, partition_command))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
