## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a specific table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug seems to be related to the formatting of the Hive command in the `else` part of the function.
4. The use of `%s` placeholders for string formatting may cause issues if the `partition_spec` function returns a string with formatting characters that conflict with the Hive command syntax.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from potential conflicts in formatting when constructing the Hive command using `%s` placeholders. If the `partition_spec` function returns a string with formatting characters (such as `%s`), it can interfere with the intended Hive command structure.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the string returned by the `partition_spec` function is properly formatted before being used in the Hive command. One way to achieve this is to format the Hive command separately from the `run_hive_cmd` call.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Format the partition spec separately to avoid conflicting formatting characters
        partition_spec_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we format the `partition_spec` string separately before constructing the Hive command. This ensures that any formatting characters within the partition spec are correctly handled and do not interfere with the final Hive command execution.
