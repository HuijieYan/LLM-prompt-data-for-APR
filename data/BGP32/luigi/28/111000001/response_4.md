## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine the existence of the table. The bug seems to be related to the way the Hive command is being constructed and executed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The construction of the Hive command might not be correct, leading to incorrect output.
2. The way the stdout is checked for the existence of the table might be causing the issue.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused by the way the Hive command is constructed in the `table_exists` function. It seems like the command for showing partitions is being incorrectly formulated, leading to unexpected results. Additionally, the check for the existence of the table in the stdout might not be accurate, causing incorrect output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure the Hive command construction is correct in both cases (with and without partitions).
2. Validate the stdout output to accurately determine the existence of the table.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_filter = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2});'.format(database, table, partition_filter))

            return bool(stdout)

```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
1. Constructed Hive commands are corrected for both cases (with and without partitions).
2. The stdout output is checked using `bool(stdout)` to accurately determine the existence of the table.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly determine if a table exists in a given database with or without partitions.
