Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is being called but not imported in the buggy function.
2. The `self.partition_spec` function is being called within the `table_exists` function but not directly defined within the same function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug in the provided function lies in the utilization of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `self.partition_spec` function without importing `run_hive_cmd` and providing the correct reference to `self.partition_spec`.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `run_hive_cmd` function in the buggy function to use it.
2. Modify the reference to the `self.partition_spec` function within the `table_exists` function to correctly access the function within the same class.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
# Import the required function
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))  # Corrected reference to partition_spec
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

By importing the `run_hive_cmd` function and correcting the reference to `self.partition_spec` function, the bug in the original function is addressed.
