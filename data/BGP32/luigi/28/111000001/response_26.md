## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in the specified database with optional partition information.
2. The function makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
3. The bug occurs in the `else` block of the function where the Hive command for checking partition information is incorrectly formatted.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block, which leads to incorrect partition information retrieval.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block to correctly check for the existence of partitions.
2. Ensure that the Hive command is correctly constructed and executed to retrieve the necessary partition information for the specified table.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Corrected formatting of the Hive command for partition check
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, ', '.join(partition.keys())))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version, the formatting of the Hive command for checking partition information has been adjusted to correctly include the partition keys. This should resolve the bug in the function.
