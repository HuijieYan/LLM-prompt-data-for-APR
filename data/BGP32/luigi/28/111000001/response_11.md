Based on the provided buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the condition used to check if the table exists in the database. The function `table_exists` is meant to return True if the table is found and False otherwise. However, the current implementation might not be handling the return values from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly.

The bug seems to be related to how the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is used to determine if the table exists based on the stdout output, but this might not work as expected.

To fix the bug, we should check if the table name is present in the stdout output without relying on the entire output. We can modify the condition as follows:
- Check if the table name is present in each line of the stdout output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        if stdout:
            for line in stdout.split('\n'):
                if table in line:
                    return True
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This modification ensures that the function correctly checks if the table exists in the stdout output line by line, returning True if the table is found and False otherwise.
