## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions and classes:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class which extends `HiveClient`.
- The `table_exists` function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute Hive queries.
- The function has conditional statements to handle cases where a `partition` is provided or not.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The way the Hive commands are constructed and executed.
2. Handling of partition information in the query.
3. Checking of the stdout for determining table existence.

## Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the construction and execution of Hive commands. The way partitions are handled in the query may not be correct, which can lead to incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the Hive queries are constructed correctly for both cases (with and without partitions).
2. Verify that the logic to check the output of the commands accurately determine the existence of the table.
3. Improve error handling and return values to provide more meaningful results.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- Hive commands are constructed with proper formatting for both cases.
- The condition for checking the existence of the table is improved to provide correct results.
- Error handling is enhanced to return `False` if there are issues with the Hive commands.
