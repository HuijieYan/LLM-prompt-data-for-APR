The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to the way the `stdout` variable is being checked for whether the table exists or not. 

In the first case where `partition` is None, the function calls `run_hive_cmd` to run a Hive query and then checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not work correctly as it will return True if `stdout` is not an empty string, regardless of whether the table is present in it or not.

In the second case where `partition` is not None, the function again calls `run_hive_cmd` with a different query and then simply checks if `stdout` exists or not. This check does not verify whether the table exists or not in the specified partition.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition check in both cases to ensure that the existence of the table is accurately determined.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return "Partition not found" not in stdout
```

In this corrected version, for the case where `partition` is None, we split the `stdout` by newline character and then check if the `table` is in the list of tables extracted from `stdout`. This ensures that we are accurately checking for the existence of the table.

Similarly, for the case where `partition` is not None, we check if the message "Partition not found" is not present in the `stdout`, indicating that the partition exists and hence the table exists.

These modifications should fix the bug and provide a more accurate check for the existence of the table in the specified conditions.
