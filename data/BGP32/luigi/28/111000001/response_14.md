## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is trying to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses `run_hive_cmd` to run Hive commands and determine the existence of the table.
2. The potential error in the buggy function lies in the construction of the Hive commands and the handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect formatting of the Hive commands in the `table_exists` function, leading to incorrect execution or interpretation of the output. Additionally, the condition for checking the existence of the table might not be evaluated correctly due to the way the output is handled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the Hive commands are constructed correctly with the appropriate placeholders for database, table, and partition. Additionally, we should properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to accurately determine the existence of the table.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of the partition_spec function goes here

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The Hive commands are constructed with the appropriate placeholders for database, table, and partition.
- The output from `run_hive_cmd` is properly handled by checking if it exists and returning a boolean value based on the result.
- The condition for checking the existence of the table is improved to accurately determine its presence in the database.
