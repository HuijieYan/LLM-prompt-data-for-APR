## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. The bug appears to be in the logic of checking the existence of the table based on the output of the command.

## Identified Issue:
The bug lies in the comparison logic in the `if` condition for checking if the table exists. The function returns the result of the comparison between `stdout` and whether `table` is in `stdout`, which may not accurately reflect the existence of the table based on the command output.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function does not always return the exact output format that can directly be used to check if the table exists. It may include additional information or formatting that renders the direct comparison inadequate.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly check for the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive command. One way to achieve this is to parse the `stdout` to extract relevant information (table names) and then perform the existence check.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        
        tables = [line.split('\t')[0] for line in stdout.splitlines()]
        
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now properly parses the output of the Hive command to extract the table names before checking for the existence of the specified table. This approach ensures a more accurate check for the table's existence based on the command output.
