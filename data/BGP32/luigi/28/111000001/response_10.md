## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a given table exists in the specified Hive database.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to interact with Hive and obtain information about the table.
3. The bug in the function lies in the logic used to check for the existence of the table, especially when handling partitions.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table with partitions. The `run_hive_cmd` invocation for the `show partitions` command is not handled correctly within the `table_exists` function. The condition for checking the existence of table partitions is problematic.

## Fix:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the way we construct the Hive command for checking partitioned tables. The command should properly handle the case when partitions are specified.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {}.{} partition ({});".format(database, database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we modify the Hive command constructed for checking partitioned tables. We include the specific database name and table name for the `show partitions` command, along with the partition specification. The `bool(stdout)` ensures that the return value is properly evaluated as `True` or `False` based on the existence of the table with partitions.
