The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly handling the case when a partition is specified. The bug occurs in the else block of the function, where the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with incorrect string formatting for the partition specification.

The bug is caused by the incorrect string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call when a partition is specified. The original code tries to format the partition specification directly into the command string, but this is done incorrectly, leading to a syntax error in the Hive query.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly format the partition specification and the command string. We should pass the partition specification as a separate argument to the `run_hive_cmd` function instead of trying to embed it within the query string.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s);' % (database, table, partition_clause))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we first generate the partition specification using the `self.partition_spec` method and then pass it as a separate argument to the `run_hive_cmd` call. This ensures that the partition specification is correctly included in the Hive query.
