## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. It makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if stdout:` may not correctly determine if the table exists.
2. The string formatting in the `stdout` assignment for the case when `partition` is not None may not be correct.
3. The return statements in both branches of the `if` condition may not be handling the presence of the table correctly.

## Cause of the bug:
1. The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the handling of the return value `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not provide a clear indication of whether the table exists or not based on the output of the command.
   
## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to correctly check the output of the Hive commands to determine if the table exists.
2. Handle the output of the Hive commands appropriately in both cases when looking for the table with or without a partition.

## Corrected version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return stdout is not None
```
