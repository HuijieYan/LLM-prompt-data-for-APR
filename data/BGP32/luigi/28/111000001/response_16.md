## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the class `HiveCommandClient`.
2. The function `run_hive_cmd` is used within the `table_exists` method to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug is likely related to how the Hive commands are being executed and checked for existence.
4. The function checks for the existence of a table in a given database and partition, if specified.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the way Hive commands are constructed and checked. In the `else` part of the function, the Hive command to check for partitions is not properly constructed. The `SHOW PARTITIONS` command in Hive should not have the `partition` keyword.
Additionally, the function incorrectly checks for the existence of the table based on the presence of the output without considering the actual content of the output.

## Bug Fix:
1. Construct the Hive command properly for checking the partitions.
2. Modify the check for table existence to verify the presence of the table name in the output of the Hive command instead of just checking if the output exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_filter = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} {2}""".format(database, table, partition_filter))
    
        return stdout.strip() != ''
```

In the corrected version:
1. The Hive command in the `else` part is constructed correctly without the `partition` keyword.
2. The check for table existence now verifies that the output is not empty after stripping whitespace.

By making these fixes, the function should now correctly determine the existence of tables and partitions in Hive.
