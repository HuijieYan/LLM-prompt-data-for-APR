### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the function does not take into account the case of the table name when comparing it against the output from Hive.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to run Hive commands and check the output.
3. The bug occurs when the table name in the `table_exists` function and the output from Hive do not match due to case differences. This causes the function to return false even when the table exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase. This way, the function can accurately determine the existence of the table.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison, the function will correctly identify whether the table exists in a case-insensitive manner. This change aligns with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896.
