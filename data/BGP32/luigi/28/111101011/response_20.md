### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The issue noted on GitHub highlights the problem of case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output of the Hive command.
3. The failing test cases involve different scenarios where the table name casing mismatches with the output from the Hive command causing the tests to fail.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does a direct string comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

### Proposed Fix:
Modify the `table_exists` function to lowercase both the table name and the output before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixing the case-insensitivity in table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to lowercase both the `table` and the `stdout` variable before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check of table existence. This fix addresses the bug identified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
