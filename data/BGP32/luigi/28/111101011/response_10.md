The buggy function `table_exists` fails the test cases due to a case sensitivity issue where it does not account for the case of the table name when checking for its existence in the Hive database. The function needs to be modified to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison of the `table` name from the function with the `stdout` to be case insensitive.
2. Convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.
3. Ensure that the comparison accounts for the possibility of different cases between the `table` name and the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive in the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it will now correctly identify the table in the Hive database regardless of the case used in the input.

This fix addresses the issue presented in the GitHub reports and ensures the test cases pass successfully.
