### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue when checking if a table exists in Hive. The problem arises due to a case sensitivity issue where the table name provided by the user might not match the case of the table name returned by Hive.

The `run_hive_cmd` function is used to execute Hive commands, and the buggy function checks the result to determine if the table exists. However, the comparison of table names in stdout and the provided table name is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the case of the table name differs.

### Bug:
The buggy function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name provided as input with the table names returned by Hive.

### Fixes:
1. Modify the comparison to be case-insensitive to handle tables with different capitalization variations.
2. Lowercase both the provided table name and the table names retrieved from stdout before comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)

```

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
