### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database using a Hive query. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The failing test cases test the behavior of `table_exists` under different scenarios, including case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence.
3. The test cases provide input values for the `database` and `table` parameters and mock the `run_hive_cmd` function's return value to simulate different outputs for the Hive queries. The failing tests occur due to case sensitivity problems in comparing the table name with the output from Hive queries.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the case insensitivity problem and suggests a fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from Hive queries. The function does a direct comparison between the input table name and the tables returned by Hive, leading to failures when the case does not match.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the comparison between the input table name and the tables returned by Hive needs to be case insensitive. Converting both the input table name and the tables in the Hive query output to lowercase before comparison would address the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

### By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the input table name and Hive query output to lowercase before comparison, we resolve the case sensitivity issue and align with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
