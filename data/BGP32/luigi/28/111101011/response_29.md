### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.
2. The issue arises when the provided table name in the function call doesn't match the case of the table name retrieved from the `stdout` value returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. When comparing whether the `table` is in `stdout`, the case of the table name needs to be considered to ensure a case-insensitive check, as described in the GitHub issues.
4. A correct fix involves converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison to make the check case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to a case-sensitive comparison between the `table` and `stdout` values in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. It leads to failing tests when the case of the table name from `stdout` doesn't match the user-provided `table` name.

### Bug Fix:
To resolve the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` should be done in lowercase. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the function will compare the lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout` to ensure case insensitivity.

### Updated Test Function:
The test functions should now reflect this case-insensitive behavior. Ensure that the test cases account for variations in table name cases.
