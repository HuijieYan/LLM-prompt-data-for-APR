Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity mismatch when comparing the table name in the Hive commands. The function does not handle case insensitivity correctly which leads to test failures when comparing table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the stdout to be case insensitive. We should convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The modification involves converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and GitHub reports.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
