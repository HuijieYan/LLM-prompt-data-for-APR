After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases along with the GitHub issue related to making the table_exists function case insensitive, we can identify the bug. The issue arises due to the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner, causing the tests to fail when the table names are in different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the stdout to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the table_exists function should now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This change aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue.

After implementing this correction, the failing test cases in the `hive_test.py` should now pass successfully when checking table existence regardless of the case of the table names.
