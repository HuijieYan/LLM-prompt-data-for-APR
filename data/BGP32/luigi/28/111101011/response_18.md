The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the `table` name with the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `stdout` might contain a lowercase version of the table name, causing the comparison to fail when the table name is provided with different cases.

The correction involves converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This adjustment aligns with the feedback provided in the GitHub issue, making the `table_exists` function handle case sensitivity appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now properly handles the case sensitivity issue. This correction ensures that the function passes the failing test cases and resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
