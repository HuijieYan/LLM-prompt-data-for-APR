Based on the provided information, the buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it directly compares the table name extracted from the Hive command output with the original table name without considering case sensitivity. This results in failing test cases when the table names have different cases between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking if the table exists in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase using `lower()` before comparison, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues and passes the failing test cases provided.
