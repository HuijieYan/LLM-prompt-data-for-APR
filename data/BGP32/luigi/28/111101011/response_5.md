### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table with a given name exists in a specified database. The issue arises when the function tries to match the table name case-sensitively with the tables fetched from the command output.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. However, the comparison of the table name with the command output is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when table names differ only in case.
3. The failing tests provide scenarios where the existing logic fails to detect the table with different casing due to case-sensitive comparisons.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names with the command output to be case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by case-sensitive comparison of the table name with the tables listed in the command output, resulting in incorrect behavior based on the table name's casing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the comparison of the table names with the tables listed in the command output to be case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of the table name with the tables listed in the command output is made case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies tables regardless of their casing.
