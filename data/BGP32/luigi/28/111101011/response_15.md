The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a case-sensitive check when comparing the table name with the tables retrieved from Hive. This results in failing tests when the case of the table names doesn't match exactly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not handling case differences in table names when comparing them with the tables retrieved from Hive. This results in false negatives in the test cases where the table name's case doesn't match the stored tables in Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stored tables in Hive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:

```python
# Fixing the bug in the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, fixing the bug identified in the failing test cases.

This corrected version should address the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding case insensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
