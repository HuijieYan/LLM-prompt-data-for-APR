### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is failing the test due to case-sensitivity issues where the table names are capitalized in the input but returned as lowercase from the `stdout`.
2. The buggy function compares the `table` directly with the `stdout`, leading to the failure.
3. The bug is caused by the direct string comparison between `table` and `stdout`, without normalizing the case of both.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout` to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By changing the comparison to lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout`, the function will now pass the failing test cases and address the case-insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
