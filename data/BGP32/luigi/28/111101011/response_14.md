### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly determine if a table exists in the database due to case sensitivity issues. The function compares the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which may cause failures when the table names have different cases.

The failing test cases highlight this issue by showing that the function fails to correctly identify tables with different cases. The GitHub issue also mentions the case insensitivity problem and suggests a solution by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case sensitive. This leads to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not, especially when the cases don't match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the database. This modification aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue and resolves the case sensitivity issue.
