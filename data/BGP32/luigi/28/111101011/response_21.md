## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
2. The function checks for table existence in Hive and returns based on the result.
3. The bug stems from the fact that the function does a direct comparison of the table name with the output from Hive, leading to case sensitivity issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the output `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we resolve the case sensitivity issue highlighted in the failing test cases. This updated version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
