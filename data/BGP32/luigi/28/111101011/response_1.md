Based on the failing test and the runtime values, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue where the table name is not being handled in a case-insensitive manner. The function does not take into account that Hive is case insensitive and might return table names with different cases than the input.

To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, you can modify the comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function now converts both the input table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, making the function case insensitive and resolving the failing tests related to case sensitivity.
