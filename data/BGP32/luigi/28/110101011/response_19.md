Given the analysis of the buggy function, it is evident that the issue stems from a case sensitivity problem when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the Hive command. To fix this bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
 class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table names retrieved from the Hive command output are converted to lowercase before comparison using `.lower()`. This modification ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue reported in GitHub.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
