### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. The bug arises from the fact that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This causes the test cases to fail when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output.

### Identified potential error location:
The bug is likely in the comparison part where `table in stdout` is being checked without considering the case of the table name and the output.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by a lack of case sensitivity handling in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. Due to case differences, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity when comparing the table name and the output from the Hive command. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lower case before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the table name and the output are both compared in a case-insensitive manner. This correction aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and addresses the case sensitivity problem.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
