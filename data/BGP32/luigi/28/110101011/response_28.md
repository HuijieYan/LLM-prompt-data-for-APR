### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file has a bug where it doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
2. The issue is related to the comparison of the table name in the returned `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug causes the tests to fail when checking for table existence with different cases of table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity in comparing the table names in `stdout`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, leading to failures when the cases don't match exactly.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`. This modification ensures case insensitivity and fixes the bug.
