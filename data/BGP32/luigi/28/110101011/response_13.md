### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database by querying Hive with the table name and database.
- The bug arises from not handling case insensitivity, leading to test failures when checking for tables with different cases.
- The issue in GitHub has identified this bug and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve the problem.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the Hive output with the provided table name.
- When the table exists in Hive but with different cases, the function fails to correctly identify it due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, enabling case-insensitive checks.
- Update the `table_exists` function to use case insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in the Hive output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue described in the failing test and GitHub bug report.
