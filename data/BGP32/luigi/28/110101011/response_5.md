### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output against the table name.

### Issue:
The bug arises when the table name case in the Hive database does not match the case of the table name provided as input to the `table_exists` function. This case sensitivity issue causes the function to return incorrect results.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of the `table` input parameter with the `stdout` from the Hive command output.
2. Handling of case sensitivity in the comparison logic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the table name provided as input in different cases with the table names from the Hive command output. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables regardless of their case.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and table names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to the case sensitivity problem.
