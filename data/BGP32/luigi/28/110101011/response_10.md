### Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
2. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database and incorrectly compares the table name with the stdout response, leading to case sensitivity issues.
3. The bug arises because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, causing tests to fail when checking for table existence with different letter case combinations.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to standardize the case of the table names before comparing them with the stdout response.
5. The corrected version of the function will involve converting both the table name and the stdout response to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout response to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, we have resolved the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue regarding making the table existence check case insensitive.
