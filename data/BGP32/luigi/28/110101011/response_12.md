### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specific Hive database.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is case sensitive and does not handle cases where the table names in Hive are different. The GitHub issues confirm that the function should be case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output from Hive commands to be case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not checking for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. This results in the tests failing when the case of the table names does not match exactly with the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output to lowercase before the comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and allow the function to detect the table correctly regardless of the case used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This fix should address the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
