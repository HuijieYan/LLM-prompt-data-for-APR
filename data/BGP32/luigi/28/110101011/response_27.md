### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table names.
2. The issue is related to the fact that the function checks if the table name is in the output of a Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is failing when the table name is provided in a different case than the output.
4. The proposed fix in the GitHub issue suggests making the comparison case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before checking in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command.
2. This change will ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug fix request.
