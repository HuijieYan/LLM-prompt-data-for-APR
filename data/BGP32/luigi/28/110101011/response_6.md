### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. The issue arises from case sensitivity in comparing the table names with the tables listed in the output.
2. The bug occurs when the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output is case-sensitive.
3. The cause of the bug is that the table names are not being compared in a case-insensitive manner. This leads to failures in the test cases where table names are provided with different cases (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable').
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive, ensuring that the table names are compared irrespective of their case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output to be case-insensitive using the lower() method.
2. Modify the return statements to consider the case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

```

After applying this correction to the `table_exists` function by making the table name and the output comparison case-insensitive, the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence check.
