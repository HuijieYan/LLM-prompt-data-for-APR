### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in the specified database. However, the current implementation is case-sensitive which leads to failing tests.
2. The buggy function compares the `table` parameter directly with the `stdout` result without considering case sensitivity.
3. The buggy function fails the test cases where the table name is provided in different cases (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable'), causing the tests to fail as the comparison is case-sensitive. This behavior was not an issue in older versions where a simple string check was sufficient.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive, allowing the function to correctly detect the table's existence irrespective of the case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` result to be case-insensitive.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check for the table's existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercased versions of the `table` and `stdout`, the corrected function should now be able to handle case-insensitive table existence checks and pass the failing tests.
