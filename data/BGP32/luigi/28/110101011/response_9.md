### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises from a case-sensitive check between the provided table name and the actual table names returned by Hive queries.
   
2. The bug occurs in the comparison step where the input table name is compared with the table names received from Hive queries without converting them to lowercase.

3. The cause of the bug is the case-sensitive comparison between the input table name and the retrieved table names from Hive queries. This results in test failures when the case of the table names does not match. The GitHub issue #896 highlights this problem and suggests making the comparison case-insensitive to resolve the issue.

4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the input `table` name and the table names retrieved from Hive queries to lowercase before comparison. By ensuring a case-insensitive comparison, the function will correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of their case.

### Correction:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the input table name `table` and the retrieved table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them for existence. This modification ensures a case-insensitive check, addressing the bug highlighted in the failing tests and GitHub issues.
