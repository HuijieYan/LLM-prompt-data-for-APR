### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. However, the comparison to check if the table exists is case-sensitive causing the test cases to fail.
2. The issue stems from the comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without converting both to the same case format, causing inconsistencies.
3. The failing test cases pass a mix of lowercase and uppercase table names to the `table_exists` function. Due to the case-sensitive nature of the comparison, the function fails to detect the table correctly based on the output received from the `run_hive_cmd`. This inconsistency results in failing test cases.
4. To fix the bug, the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` need to be converted to the same case format (either both lowercase or both uppercase) before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the comparison of the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the `table_exists` function can correctly determine the existence of a table regardless of the case of the table name.
