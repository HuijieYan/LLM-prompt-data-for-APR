### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues. The function is not handling the case sensitivity of the table names properly.
2. The bug is related to how the function compares the table names with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug causes the function to fail the test cases where the table case does not match exactly. The GitHub issue highlights this issue and suggests making the comparison case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names with the output to be case insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version modifies the comparison `table in stdout` to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to ensure case insensitivity. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.

After applying this correction, the `table_exists` function should now be able to handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases.
