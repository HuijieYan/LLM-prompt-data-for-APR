### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is meant to check if a table exists in a given database. The issue arises due to case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases. The `stdout` is compared directly to the table name without considering the case.

### Error Location
The error lies in the comparison between the table name and `stdout`, where the case sensitivity issue is not handled.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` output is case sensitive. When the `stdout` contains the lower case version of the `table` name, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect test results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing test cases. This correction aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestions and resolves the case sensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function.
