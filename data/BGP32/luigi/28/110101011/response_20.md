### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands.
2. The function fails in the `else` block where it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table.
3. The failing test cases verify the existence of tables in different scenarios and highlight the case sensitivity issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is case-insensitive.
5. The suggested fix is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the table name is in a different case than the output, the comparison fails.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues and should pass the failing tests.
