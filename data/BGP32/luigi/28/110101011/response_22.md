### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database based on the provided table name, database, and optional partition.
2. The issue arises when comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner, causing failures in tests where the table names are provided in different cases.
3. The failing test cases and the GitHub issues indicate that the comparison should be made case-insensitive to align with Hive's behavior and avoid issues with table name case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the tables in the database should be done in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The correction involves converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function performing a case-sensitive check when determining if a table exists in Hive, causing tests to fail when table names are provided in different cases than what Hive returns.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison between the table name and the tables in the Hive database to be case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import HiveClient, run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Justification of Correction:
- The corrected version now converts both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison, making the check case-insensitive.
- The comparison with the tables in the database is now performed using a case-insensitive approach, ensuring the function works correctly with table names in different cases.
