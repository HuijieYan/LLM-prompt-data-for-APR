### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database by running commands.
2. The bug occurs due to case sensitivity in table name comparison between the requested table name and the actual table names returned from the Hive command.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate issues with case sensitivity causing the tests to fail even when the table exists.
4. The bug's root cause is the direct comparison of the table names without considering case differences.
5. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the requested table name and the returned table names to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Correction:
```python
# Updated HiveCommandClient class with corrected table_exists function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now ensures case-insensitive checks for table existence in Hive databases. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and will make the function more resilient to case variations in table names.
