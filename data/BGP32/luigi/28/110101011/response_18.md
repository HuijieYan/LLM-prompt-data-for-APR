Based on the provided information:

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not account for case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This results in failing tests where the case of the table names does not match exactly.

2. The potential error lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. The failing tests provide examples where the table name casing impacts the comparison result.

4. To fix the bug, a case-insensitive comparison method needs to be used when checking for the table name in the Hive command output.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function that includes a case-insensitive check:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, the comparison between the lowercased table name and the lowercased output from the Hive command ensures that the check is case-insensitive, addressing the issue identified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
