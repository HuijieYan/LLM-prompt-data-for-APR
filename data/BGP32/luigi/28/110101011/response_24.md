### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing tests to fail when the table names have different cases.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the function should be case insensitive when checking table existence.
5. To fix the bug, we need to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This causes incorrect results in scenarios where the case of the table name does not match the case of the output from Hive.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison to make it case insensitive.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

After making the above correction, the `table_exists` function should now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
