### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check the existence of a table in a Hive database. However, the issue arises when the table names have different cases due to Hive being case-insensitive.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` method without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate how the function fails to correctly identify table existence when the cases do not match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
5. We will modify the `table_exists` function to ensure it is case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function will now correctly identify table existence regardless of the case. This fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and should address the problem effectively.
