### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database, but it has a bug related to case sensitivity.
2. The bug seems to stem from not handling case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is failing due to differences in case between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from the command are compared in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The fix involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function, the bug related to case sensitivity should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test cases.
