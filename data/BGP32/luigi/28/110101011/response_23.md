### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to determine if a table exists in the specified database by running Hive commands.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the table exists in the database due to case sensitivity issues.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function fails to handle case insensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.
4. The GitHub issue points out the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid such problems.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. This results in false negatives when the case of the table name and the output do not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison between the table name and the output to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making both the table name and the output lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures that the function is case insensitive when determining the existence of a table in the database. This fix should address the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
