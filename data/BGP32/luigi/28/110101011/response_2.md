### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class doesn't handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem and provides a potential solution.
3. The failing test cases attempt to check the existence of tables with different cases, which exposes the bug in the function.
4. The function compares the table name directly with the stdout without considering case differences, leading to incorrect results.
5. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `table_exists` directly compares the table name with the stdout without considering case differences. This leads to failing tests when the table names have different cases due to Hive's case insensitivity behavior.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and address the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive properly. This modification should resolve the failing tests and address the GitHub reported issue.
