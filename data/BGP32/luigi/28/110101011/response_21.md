### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in the specified database using Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity, as the function currently directly compares the table name with the table names returned from Hive commands without considering case.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function fails when the table name cases do not match between expected and returned values, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the expected table name and the table names returned from Hive commands is case insensitive.
5. By making the comparison case insensitive, the function will accurately determine if the table exists in the database regardless of the case of the table name.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version of the `table_exists` function uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the database.
- By converting both the expected table name and the table names returned by Hive commands to lowercase before comparison, the function will correctly handle case differences and provide accurate results.
- With this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
