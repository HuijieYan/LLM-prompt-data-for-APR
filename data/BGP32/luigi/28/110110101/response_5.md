### Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
- The function calls `run_hive_cmd` with different commands based on whether a partition is provided or not.
- The bug seems to be related to the logic checking the return value of the `run_hive_cmd`.
- The failing test cases cover scenarios where the `run_hive_cmd` returns specific values and the `table_exists` function should behave accordingly.

### Bug Explanation
- In the buggy function, the logic to check whether a table exists relies on the contents of the `stdout` returned by `run_hive_cmd`.
- However, the logic of comparing `table in stdout` is faulty as it only checks if the table name exists in the complete output, which may lead to false positives.
- In the failing test, specifically for case 3, the function incorrectly returns `True` even though the provided partition does not exist in the `stdout` output.

### Fix Strategy
- Instead of just checking if the table name exists in the complete `stdout`, we should check each line separately to accurately determine if the table exists.
- We should split the `stdout` by lines and iterate over them to search for the exact table name.
- Additionally, we should trim any leading or trailing whitespaces from each line to ensure accurate comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_lines = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(table == line.strip() for line in table_lines)

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partition_lines = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(self.partition_spec(partition) == line.strip() for line in partition_lines)
```

By correcting the function to compare individual lines instead of the complete `stdout`, we ensure a more accurate determination of whether the table or partition exists, addressing the bugs identified in the failing tests.
