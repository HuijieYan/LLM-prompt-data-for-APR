### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to interact with Hive.
2. The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table with case sensitivity issues in the table name.
3. The failing test checks for the expected behavior of the function when dealing with case-insensitive table names.
4. The bug is caused by the fact that the comparison in the function is case-sensitive, leading to failures when case differences are present.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison operation to be case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we will modify the comparison operation to be case-insensitive using the `lower()` function. This will ensure that table names are compared without being affected by case differences.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function adds the `lower()` method to both the `table` variable and `stdout` variable, ensuring case-insensitive comparison for table existence.
