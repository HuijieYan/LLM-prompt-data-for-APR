### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a given database with or without a partition.
3. The bug lies in the conditional statements where the function checks the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The failing test case checks for the correct behavior of the `table_exists` function with different input scenarios and expected output values.

### Bug Explanation
When the `table_exists` function is called with a table name that does exist in the database, the function should return `True`. However, due to the way the function is currently implemented, it returns `False` in that case, leading to assertion errors in the test cases where the expected result is `True`.

The bug is specifically in the conditional checks based on the `stdout` variable containing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly determines the existence of the table based on the presence of the table name in the output, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine the existence of the table based on that parsed information. Additionally, the condition checks need to be adjusted to return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it doesn't.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout is not None
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass all the provided failing test cases.
