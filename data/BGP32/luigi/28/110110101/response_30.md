### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a specific table exists in the Hive database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve output.
3. The bug lies in the way the function handles the condition when a partition is provided. The function constructs the Hive command incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.
4. A strategy to fix the bug would involve correcting the Hive command string for partitioned tables when calling `run_hive_cmd`.
5. The corrected version should properly construct the Hive command for both non-partitioned and partitioned tables.

### Correction:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By correcting the construction of the Hive command in the else block and returning a boolean value based on the existence of the output, the function should now pass all the provided test cases.
