### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table or partition exists in a database. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the stdout (standard output) of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Based on the failing test cases and the comparison between the expected and actual values, the buggy function is not correctly evaluating the existence of the table or partition.

### Bug
The bug occurs when checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should return `True` if the table or partition exists and `False` if it does not. However, due to the incorrect evaluation of the stdout variable, the function is not returning the expected results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly evaluate the stdout variable and return `True` when the table or partition exists and `False` when it doesn't.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

By applying the above correction, the `table_exists` function will correctly evaluate the stdout and return `True` if the table or partition exists and `False` if it doesn't. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass all the failing test cases.
