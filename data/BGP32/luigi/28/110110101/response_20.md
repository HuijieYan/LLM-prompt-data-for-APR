The buggy function has a logical error in the `table_exists` method where the `stdout` variable is checked directly for truthiness instead of looking for the presence of the table name in the output.

The issue arises when the `stdout` value is not empty but does not contain the table name, causing the function to return `True` incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` value for both cases (with and without partition).

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly checks if the table name is present in the output `stdout` variable before returning `True`.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
