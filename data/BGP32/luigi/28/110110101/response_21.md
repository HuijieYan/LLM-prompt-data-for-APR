### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to get information, then checks if the table is in the output.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The failing test case expects different outcomes based on the values provided to the function.
- The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected value.

### Bug:
The bug is likely in how the `stdout` variable is being checked after running the `run_hive_cmd`. The function may not be correctly handling the response from the command, causing incorrect results and subsequently failing the tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes and checks the output received from running the hive command. Specifically, we need to check if the table name is present in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition\n({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By incorporating the partition_spec retrieval and using a single format method to construct the hive command, we ensure that the correct query is being executed to check for table existence with partitions.
