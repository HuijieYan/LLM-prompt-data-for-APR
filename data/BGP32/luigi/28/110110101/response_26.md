### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a database. It performs this check by running a Hive command and then checking the output to see if the table name is present. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the output.

### Identified Issue
The bug seems to be happening when checking if a table exists in the Hive output. The logic for checking the presence of the table name is incorrect, leading to incorrect assertions in the test cases.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the Hive commands to determine if a table exists. It currently checks if the entire command output string matches the table name, which is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the output of the Hive commands to check for the existence of the table name. This can be done by splitting the output into lines and then checking if the table name appears in any of the lines.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

### Explanation
- In the corrected version, we split the stdout by `\n` to get individual lines.
- We then check if the table name is present in any of the individual lines.
- This approach ensures that we are correctly checking for the existence of the table name in the output.

By using this corrected version of the function, it should now pass all the failing test cases and correctly determine if a table exists in the given conditions.
