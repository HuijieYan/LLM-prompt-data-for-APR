### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a specific table (with optional partition) exists in a given database by running a Hive command.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the stdout value from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test cases include scenarios where the table exists and where it doesn't exist. The bug causes incorrect evaluation of the stdout, leading to failing assertions.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the conditional checks for stdout to ensure they correctly determine if the table exists or not.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return "SUCCESS" in stdout
```

By modifying the conditional check in the else block to check for "SUCCESS" in the stdout string, we can accurately determine if the table exists with the given partition. This approach should address the bug and ensure the function passes the failing test cases.
