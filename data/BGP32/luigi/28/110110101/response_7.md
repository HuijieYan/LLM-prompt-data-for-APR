### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and returns a boolean value indicating the presence of the table.
2. The first part of the function checks if a partition is provided or not. If not, it executes a command using `show tables` in the specified database.
3. The second part executes a command to show partitions of a table based on the partition specification.
4. The failing test is checking the behavior of the function when executing different Hive commands and expecting the correct response based on the output.
5. The function fails the test cases due to incorrect logic in the conditional statements, which affects the return values that are being checked in the test cases.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the condition used to return True or False based on the `stdout` value is incorrect. The function directly checks the validity of `stdout`, which can be problematic because sometimes valid output can still evaluate to false. Additionally, the logic in the `else` block seems redundant.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should first split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check whether the table name is present in the resulting list. This will ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of a table based on the Hive command output.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters, the function correctly handles multiple records and checks if the provided table exists. This fix should make the function pass the failing test cases.
