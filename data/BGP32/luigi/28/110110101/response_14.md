### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has two main sections: one for when `partition` is `None` and another when it has a value. The bug seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness. 

### Bug
In the first section of the function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is used to check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output. However, this condition is incorrect as it will return `True` even if `stdout` contains any non-empty string, not necessarily the table name. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases where `OK` exists in the `stdout`.
In the second section, the condition checks only if `stdout` exists but does not check if the table name is present in the output.

### Solution
To fix this bug, we need to properly split the `stdout` output into lines and check if the table name exists in the list of lines. This ensures the correct detection of whether the table exists in the Hive environment.

### Updated Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` lines and checking if the `table` is present in the list of lines, we ensure that the function correctly identifies if the table exists or not. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
