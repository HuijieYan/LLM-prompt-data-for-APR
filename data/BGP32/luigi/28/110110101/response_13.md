### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is trying to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command.
2. There are two branches in the function - one for checking without a partition and one for checking with a partition.
3. The bug occurs when checking if a table exists with a partition, it doesn't effectively handle the partition-specific logic.
4. The function incorrectly calls `self.partition_spec(partition)` inside the Hive command instead of passing the partition as a string directly.
5. To fix this bug, we need to modify the Hive command string construction for the case with a partition.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly constructing the Hive command string when checking if a table exists with a partition. The function `table_exists` tries to call `self.partition_spec(partition)` inside the Hive command, which results in incorrect string formatting.

### Bug Fix:
We need to modify the way the Hive command is constructed when checking for a table with a partition. Instead of calling `self.partition_spec(partition)`, we should directly pass the partition as a string in the Hive command.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By directly constructing the partition string and passing it in the Hive command, we ensure that the partition logic is correctly handled, fixing the bug in the `table_exists` function.
