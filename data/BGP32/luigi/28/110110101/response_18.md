### Buggy Function Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. The bug occurs in the logic that checks the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Identification
1. The first branch of the if-else statement does not correctly compare the `table` with the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The second branch has issues in formatting the SQL command for checking partitions.

### Bug Explanation
When running the failing test, the function fails to correctly determine the existence of a table. This is due to incorrect comparison logic in the first branch of the if-else statement. In the case where the table exists, the function does not return `True` as expected because the logic to check if the table is in the `stdout` is flawed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the comparison logic in the first branch to correctly check if the table name is in the `stdout` response.
2. Fix the formatting issue in the SQL command in the second branch to ensure correct execution.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

The corrected function now handles the comparison of table names in the `stdout` response correctly and formats the SQL command for checking partitions accurately. The function should pass all the provided test cases.
