### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if a table/partition exists in a particular database.
2. The function has conditions to handle a `partition` parameter, but it seems that the logic within these conditions is not correctly implemented.
3. The failing test asserts the return value of the function, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output.
4. The current implementation of the function does not correctly check if a table exists. It returns `True` if there is any output from the command without checking if the table is specifically mentioned in the output.
5. The function needs to be modified to accurately verify the existence of a table or partition in the database.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function simply checks if there is any output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without verifying if the table/partition name is present in that output. This leads to incorrect results, causing the test assertions to fail.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to specifically check if the table/partition name is present in the output generated by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Improve the conditional logic to handle both cases (with and without partition) correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now correctly checks if the table name is present in the stdout output when querying for a table or partition.
- The conditional logic for handling partitions has been improved to ensure accurate results.
- The function should now pass the failing test cases by correctly determining the existence of tables or partitions.
