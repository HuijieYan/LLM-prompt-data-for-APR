### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database in Hive. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands to find the information.
2. The logic in the function is flawed as it does not handle the cases properly where the expected output does not match the actual results obtained from running Hive commands.
3. The failing test cases provide varying scenarios where the function fails to correctly determine the existence of tables or partitions in the database due to incorrect output parsing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the stdout from Hive commands and returns the correct boolean value indicating the existence of tables.
5. We need to modify the logic inside the function to handle different scenarios accurately and return the expected results.

### Bug fix strategy
1. Parse the stdout from Hive commands properly to ensure accurate results.
2. Modify the conditional checks to correctly determine the existence of tables in different scenarios.
3. Return the boolean value based on the successful execution of Hive commands.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')

        else:
            partition_query = "partitions %s partition (%s)" % (table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show {1}'.format(database, partition_query))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now properly parses the stdout from Hive commands and returns the correct boolean value based on the existence of tables or partitions in the database. It splits the stdout by newline characters and checks for the presence of the table name. In the case of partitions, it constructs the partition query and checks if the stdout is not empty to indicate the existence of partitions.
