### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks whether a given table exists in a database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive queries. 
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in the `table_exists` function when handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` method.
3. When the `table_exists` function receives the output from `run_hive_cmd`, it checks if the table name exists in the output. However, in the case where a partition is specified, it checks for the presence of partitions instead of the table name. This leads to incorrect results and causes the test cases to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly checks for the existence of table names and does not confuse partitions with table names.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

By modifying the code to always use the same query to fetch table names irrespective of whether a partition is specified or not, we ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of the table in the database. This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in all scenarios.
