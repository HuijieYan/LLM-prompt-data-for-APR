### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a database based on the provided parameters. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive query and then checks the stdout for the presence of the table name.

The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to failed test cases. In particular, the issue lies in how the function handles the returned stdout and compares it with the table name.

The failing test cases cover scenarios with different combinations of table names, databases, and partitions, expecting specific outcomes based on the stdout result.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to the way the function checks for the existence of a table in Hive. When parsing the result from the Hive commands, the function evaluates the existence of a table incorrectly, leading to false positives or false negatives in the table existence check.

The core issue lies in the way the function compares the table name with the stdout. The function incorrectly expects a direct match of the table name without considering other elements in the stdout, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the stdout from the Hive commands and accurately checks for the presence of the table in the database.

One possible strategy to fix the bug is to split the stdout into individual lines to handle multi-line responses properly. Then, we can compare each line separately to check for the table existence within the database. Additionally, we should address the case sensitivity issue when matching table names.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split("\n")
            return any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in tables if t.strip())
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
- We split the `stdout` into lines and compare each table name after stripping with case-insensitive matching to determine if the table exists in the results.
- When checking partitions, we ensure that the trimmed `stdout` is not empty, indicating the presence of at least one partition.
- The corrected implementation should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input and output values for the function.
