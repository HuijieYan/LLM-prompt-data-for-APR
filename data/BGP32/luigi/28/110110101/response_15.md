### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a given table exists in a database by running Hive commands. It has two branches - one for when `partition` is `None`, and one for when `partition` is provided.
2. In the first branch without partition, the function is checking if the table name exists in the output of a `show tables` command.
3. The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` in the first branch of the function. The actual check to see if the table exists is incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly check if the table is present in the output of the Hive command. Additionally, we need to update the formatting of the Hive command in the second branch.
5. We need to ensure that the function correctly returns `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

### Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
    
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly check if the table exists in the database based on the provided input and return `True` or `False` accordingly. This should resolve the failing test cases.
