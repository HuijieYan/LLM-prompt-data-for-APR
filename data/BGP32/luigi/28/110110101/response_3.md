### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database, with the option to specify a partition. The bug likely lies in how the function handles the outputs of the different commands it runs.
2. The function uses a `run_hive_cmd` command which returns the output of the Hive query executed. Depending on the execution of the query, the function returns `True` or `False` based on the existence of the table.
3. The bug seems to be in the handling of the `stdout` variable after running the Hive commands. In the failing test cases, we observe that the function fails to correctly handle the formatting of the output strings, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable is properly processed to check for the existence of the table.
5. The corrected version of the function should correctly parse the output of the Hive commands and interpret the results accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Convert and check the output
        
```

By splitting the `stdout` string on newline characters and checking for the existence of the table name within the resulting list, we can accurately determine if the table exists. Additionally, the corrected function handles the space formatting and empty output cases properly to ensure correct behavior.
