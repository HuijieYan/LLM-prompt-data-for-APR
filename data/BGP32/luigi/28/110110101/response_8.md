### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a database using `hive` commands.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands.
3. The bug lies in the conditional statements returning the result based on the presence of the table or partition in the stdout.
4. The bug causes the function to return the opposite value of what is expected in some cases.
5. The bug can be fixed by properly checking the presence of the table/partition in the stdout and returning `True` only when the table/partition is found.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add proper logic to handle the conditions where the table or partition is correctly found in the output of the `hive` command. Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version properly splits the stdout on newline characters to check for the presence of the table. It also directly returns the boolean result based on the presence of output in the stdout for the partition check. This should now pass all the failing test cases.
