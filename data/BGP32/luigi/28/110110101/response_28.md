### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. 
2. The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test is checking for the presence of a table in the database, and the bug is causing incorrect results to be returned.
4. One strategy to fix the bug is to properly parse and validate the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return 'OK' in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return 'OK' in stdout.split()
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newlines and checking if `'OK'` is present in the resulting list, we can accurately determine if the table exists in the database based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. This corrected implementation should now pass the failing tests.
