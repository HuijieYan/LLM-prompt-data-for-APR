### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test case expects the function to return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it doesn't.
4. The bug occurs because the function doesn't correctly parse the `stdout` output to determine if the table exists.
   
### Bug:
The bug lies in how the function processes the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It fails to properly check if the table name exists in the output and always returns `True` or `False` based on whether `stdout` is present or not.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the `stdout` output to check if the table exists in the given database. We should check if the table name appears in the output, and return `True` if it does and `False` if it doesn't.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split()  # Check if the table name is present in the output
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now correctly checks if the table exists in the database based on the `stdout` output. It splits the output and looks for the table name, returning `True` if found and `False` if not found. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases.
