### The buggy code analysis
1. **Buggy Function (`table_exists`):** The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database using a Hive query. The function has two main branches based on whether a `partition` parameter is provided or not.

2. **Failing Test:** The failing test `test_table_exists` is testing the `table_exists` function by mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and asserting the returned values based on different scenarios. The test is failing due to incorrect assertions in the function.

3. **Error Location:** The bug in the function lies in the logic of checking the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue is with the conditional checks and how the function processes the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

4. **Cause of the Bug:** The bug causes incorrect assertions in the function because the function does not correctly handle the response from `run_hive_cmd` in both the partitioned and non-partitioned scenarios. This results in the function returning incorrect results, leading to failed assertions in the test.

5. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Ensure that the function correctly parses and processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if a table exists in the database.
   - Adjust the conditional checks in the function to return `True` when a table is found in the Hive output and `False` when it is not found.
   - Make sure to handle both the partitioned and non-partitioned scenarios appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, escape_hive_name(table)))

            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, escape_hive_name(table), self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout.strip() != ''  # Check if partitions exist

def escape_hive_name(name):
    return name.replace('`', '``')
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Properly Parsing Output:** The corrected version uses `strip()` on the `stdout` to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces for accurate comparison.
2. **Handling Partitioned Tables:** For partitioned tables, the function checks if the output is not empty to verify the existence of partitions.
3. **Added Helper Function:** A new helper function `escape_hive_name` is introduced to properly format the table name for Hive query.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected results as specified in the test cases.
