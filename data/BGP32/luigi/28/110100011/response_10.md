# Explanation of the bug and solution strategy:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case insensitivity correctly when checking for table existence in Hive.
- The bug occurs because the function compares the table name without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table name is in a different case.
- The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.
- The corrected version of the function now converts both the table name and stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.

By implementing this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
