## Analysis:

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. The issue reported on GitHub (#896) highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
3. The buggy function fails the test `test_table_exists` by only checking for an exact match between the table name and the output from Hive commands, causing case sensitivity issues.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

## Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the bug related to case sensitivity is fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
