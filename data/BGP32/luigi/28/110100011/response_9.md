After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, and the GitHub issue, here is the list of identified potential error locations:

1. In the `table_exists` function, the comparison of the table name with the output from the hive command is case-sensitive. This can lead to test failures when the table name is in a different case than the one returned by Hive.

The cause of the bug is that the comparison in the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity, which is necessary due to the behavior of Hive returning table names in lowercase regardless of how they were created.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version modifies the comparison by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures case-insensitivity in checking table existence.

By implementing this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
