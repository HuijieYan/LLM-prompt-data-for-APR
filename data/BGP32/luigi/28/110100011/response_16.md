## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database and partition.
2. The issue arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name from the `stdout`.
3. The bug was reported in GitHub issue #896, indicating that the function should be case insensitive when checking if a table exists.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by case sensitivity in comparing the table name to the output from Hive commands. If the table name is in a different case than the `stdout` result, the comparison will fail.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the `stdout` are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
