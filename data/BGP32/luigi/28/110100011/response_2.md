## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence. The issue on GitHub highlights that when checking for existing tables, the function does not handle uppercase vs. lowercase table names correctly, causing test failures.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity.
2. Inconsistent use of `stdout` comparison in different code paths.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the `table_exists` function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to test failures when dealing with table names that differ in case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function can correctly determine if the table exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase before comparison to handle case insensitivity correctly.
- The comparison logic has been simplified to check if the lowercase table name is in the lowercase output.
- The `bool()` function is used to convert the `stdout` value to a boolean for consistency in the function return.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
