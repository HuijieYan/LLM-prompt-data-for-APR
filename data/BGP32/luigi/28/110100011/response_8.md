To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase before checking for the table existence. This will resolve the issue reported in GitHub regarding case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and the output `stdout` to lowercase before checking for table existence, the function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing test cases provided. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and will address the reported bug effectively.
