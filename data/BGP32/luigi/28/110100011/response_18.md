## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class which inherits from `HiveClient`.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a database, but there is a case-sensitivity issue where the function does not handle the case of the table name correctly.
3. The failing test indicates that the function fails to correctly identify table names due to case sensitivity.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to address the problem.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
