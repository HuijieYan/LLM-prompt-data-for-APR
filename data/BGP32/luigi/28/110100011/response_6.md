## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case insensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
2. The bug is causing the test cases to fail when trying to check for the existence of tables with different case variations.

## Error Locations:
1. The bug is in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable without considering case insensitivity.
2. The bug is present in the logic of the `table_exists` function, causing it to return incorrect results for case-insensitive table checks.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug is caused because the function compares the `table` string directly with the `stdout` without converting both to lower case for a case-insensitive comparison.
2. The failing test cases in the test file are expecting case-insensitive comparisons for table existence checks, which the buggy function does not support.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the logic to handle case-insensitive checks properly to pass the failing tests and address the issue reported in GitHub.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making the comparison case-insensitive and correcting the logic, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to case-insensitive table existence checks.
