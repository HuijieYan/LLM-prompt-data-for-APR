### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `table_exists()` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a database, taking into account the table name and partition information.
3. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the result from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The failure in the test occurs due to case mismatches between the table name and the returned result.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Updated Explanation for Correction:
1. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the `stdout` result from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.
2. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread and passing the failing test.
3. The `return bool(stdout)` statement simplifies the check for the presence of `stdout`.

By making the comparison case insensitive, the bug is resolved, and the `table_exists` function now behaves as expected.
