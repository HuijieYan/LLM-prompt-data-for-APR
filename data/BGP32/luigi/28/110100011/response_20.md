### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module contains the bug related to case sensitivity while checking for table existence. The function compares the table name obtained from the `stdout` with the input table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures in certain scenarios.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of table names without case normalization.
2. Handling of partitioned tables.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from comparing the table names returned by Hive with the input table name without considering case sensitivity. As Hive is case-insensitive regarding table names, the comparison should be done considering both cases to accurately determine table existence.

The failing test cases are designed to verify the `table_exists` function's behavior in responding appropriately to different `stdout` outputs from Hive commands.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table names obtained from `stdout` and the input table names should be done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to use lowercase comparison when checking for table existence, the bug will be fixed. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report related to case insensitivity.
