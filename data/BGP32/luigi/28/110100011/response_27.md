## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is not handling case sensitivity appropriately.
2. The problem arises when comparing the table name extracted from the `stdout` with the input table name, resulting in test failures for differently cased table names.

## Error:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly compares the table name extracted from `stdout` with the input table name without considering case sensitivity. This leads to inconsistent behavior when the case of the table names does not match.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comparison of table names is case insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the extracted table name and the input table name to lowercase before the comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should now pass the failing test cases.
