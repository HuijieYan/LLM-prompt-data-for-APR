## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the given test code and GitHub issue:

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the table name and stdout in the table_exists function without considering case insensitivity.
2. The way the stdout is handled to check for table existence.

### Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case insensitivity when checking the existence of a table in the database. This results in the test cases failing when the table names are in different cases than what is returned by Hive.

The GitHub issues posted highlight the problem by pointing out that Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparison in the `table_exists` function to fail for tables with different case formats.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Now, let's provide a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function addresses the case insensitivity issue highlighted in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided, resolving the case sensitivity bug in the `table_exists` function for HiveClient.
