## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity, where the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case-sensitive.
3. The failing test case highlights the issue when comparing table names such as `mytable` and `MyTable`, causing the test to fail due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` should be made case-insensitive.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to the test failures when different cases are used.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `run_hive_cmd` output is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the bug should be fixed.
