### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case insensitivity properly, which is causing the test to fail.
2. The issue is related to comparing the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug occurs because the function checks if the table name is in the stdout directly without converting both to lowercase. This causes the comparison to fail when the case of the table names does not match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now the corrected version of the `table_exists` function will handle case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This modification will ensure that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test provided.

This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue discussions related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
