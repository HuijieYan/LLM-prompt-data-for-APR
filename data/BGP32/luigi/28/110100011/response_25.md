## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table but is not handling case sensitivity properly.
2. The bug is related to not handling case sensitivity while comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command.
3. The failing test in `hive_test.py` is specifically checking for case sensitivity issues with table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase for comparison.
5. We should update the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison and also convert the output of the Hive command to lowercase.

## Proposed Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout output are converted to lowercase before comparison, which resolves the case sensitivity issue. This fix addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue as well.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function will now handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test case, ensuring that table existence checks are performed accurately.
