## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name to the output obtained from Hive commands. This results in failing tests where the table name is in a different case than expected in the output.

## Identified Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case sensitive.
2. The comparison `self.partition_spec(partition)` does not handle case sensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output returned by Hive commands. This causes the test cases to fail when the case of the table name is different in the output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.
2. Implement case-insensitive comparisons to ensure compatibility with the case sensitivity of Hive queries.
3. Update the implementation to handle different cases when checking for table existence.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition).lower()))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This correction addresses the failing test cases and resolves the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
