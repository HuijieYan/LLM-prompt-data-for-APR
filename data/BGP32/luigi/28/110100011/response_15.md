1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
   - The failing test is checking for the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
   - The GitHub issue discusses the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive to align with Hive's behavior.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The bug is likely in the comparison logic of the `table_exists` function, where it checks if the table exists in Hive.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug stems from not considering case sensitivity when checking if the table exists in the stdout returned by the Hive command. It leads to failing tests when the table name capitalization is different.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This will make the check case insensitive and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the returned stdout are converted to lowercase for comparison, making the check case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.
