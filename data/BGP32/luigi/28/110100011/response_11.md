# Explanation:

1. **Analysis:**
   - The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
   - The failing test case `test_table_exists` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and expects case-insensitive table existence checks.

2. **Error Locations:**
   - The function is currently comparing the `table` name directly with the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity.

3. **Bug Cause:**
   - The bug causes the test cases to fail for table names with different cases than expected due to the comparison without considering case-insensitivity.
   - The issue reported on GitHub highlights this limitation and suggests a solution to address the case sensitivity problem.

4. **Fix Strategy:**
   - To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

5. **Corrected Version:**
   - The corrected version of the function modifies the comparison to check for the lowercase version of both `table` and `stdout` strings, ensuring case insensitivity.
   - This correction aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue and resolves the problem with case-sensitive table existence checks.
