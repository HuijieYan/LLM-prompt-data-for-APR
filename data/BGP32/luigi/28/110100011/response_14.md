## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the table name is not matched properly when it contains different cases.
2. The bug is due to the comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug is reported in GitHub issue #896, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.
   
## Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the comparison of table names will be case insensitive, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
