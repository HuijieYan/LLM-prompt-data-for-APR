### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the case insensitivity problem with this function.
2. The potential error locations are:
   - Incorrect comparison of table names (case sensitivity issue)
   - Incorrect construction of the `stdout` variable
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is directly comparing the table name without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failures when table names are not in the expected case. The failing test also checks for different variations of table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case-insensitive and should pass the failing test cases.
