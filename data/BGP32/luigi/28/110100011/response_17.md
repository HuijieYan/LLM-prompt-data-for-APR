## Analyzing the Bug:

1. The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
2. The failing test is `test_table_exists` in the `test/contrib/hive_test.py` file.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the table name check in `table_exists` should be case insensitive as Hive returns table names in lowercase.
4. The bug occurs because the function does a direct equality check between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which may be in lowercase.
5. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `run_hive_cmd` output to lowercase for comparison.

## Fixing the Bug:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the fixed version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing for table existence. This change makes the comparison case insensitive as required by the GitHub issue. The function now returns `True` if the table is found in the `stdout` output (case insensitive) and `False` otherwise. The fix should make the failing test pass and resolve the GitHub issue.
