## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database.
2. The bug arises from the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner with the output received from the Hive command. This causes the function to fail when the table name case does not match the case of the output from Hive.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` highlights the issue by demonstrating that the function fails when the table name case does not match. The provided GitHub issue also describes the problem and suggests a solution.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected function will now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
