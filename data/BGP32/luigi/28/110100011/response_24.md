## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the test code and GitHub issue:

1. The buggy function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is `table_exists`, which is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database.
2. The failing test function `test_table_exists` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function and tests the behavior of the `table_exists` function.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the `table_exists` function should be case-insensitive as Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing tests to fail when searching for capitalized table names.
4. The suggested fix is to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase of the output.
5. The buggy function needs to be modified to implement a case-insensitive check for table existence.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error location within the `table_exists` function is the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive, which is not case-insensitive.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises because the `table_exists` function directly checks if the table name exists in the Hive output without considering case sensitivity. Since Hive returns table names in lowercase, the function fails to accurately determine the existence of tables with different capitalizations.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, making the check case-insensitive.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, we ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
