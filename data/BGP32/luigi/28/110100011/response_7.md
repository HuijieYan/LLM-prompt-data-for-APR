## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command.
2. The bug occurs due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights that the function needs to be case insensitive to handle situations where table names are provided in different cases than they are stored in Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                     (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this updated version of the `table_exists` function, we now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This modification ensures that the function can correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of the case in which they are provided.

After implementing this fix, the test cases should pass, resolving the case sensitivity issue as reported in the GitHub bug report.
