## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in Hive by running certain commands. However, it is failing due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function checks for table existence without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures when the table names are not in the expected case.
3. The bug is causing failures in the test cases where table existence is checked using different cases of table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will be able to identify the table existence case insensitively, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
