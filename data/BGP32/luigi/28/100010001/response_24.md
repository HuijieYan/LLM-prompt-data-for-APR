### Analysis:
1. The failing test is asserting that the `table_exists` function should return `True`, but it is returning `False`.
2. The function has a conditional statement that checks if the `partition` argument is `None` and executes different queries based on this condition.
3. The bug is likely in the conditional check for the `partition` argument and the subsequent queries being executed.
4. The bug might be due to incorrect logic in the conditional check for partitions and the construction of the query strings.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect formation of the query string within the conditional check when the `partition` argument is not `None`. The query string and formatting are not correct for this scenario, leading to the function not behaving as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the query strings are properly formatted and constructed for both scenarios.
2. Correct the logic within the conditional check for the `partition` argument.
3. Update the function to return `True` when the table exists in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return table in stdout
``` 

### Change Explanation:
1. Used f-string to format the query strings for improved readability.
2. Removed unnecessary check for stdout before returning the result.
3. Updated both query strings to match the correct format for Hive queries.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the test cases.
