### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database in Hive.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is returning `False` when it should return `True`.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely located in the conditional statements of the function where it determines whether to return `True` or `False` based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function is not handling the format of the output returned by `run_hive_cmd`.
- Specifically, the function expects the output to contain the table name(s) when checking for tables in the database. If the output does not match the expected format, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the conditional statements to correctly check if the table name exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, ensuring proper handling of the output format.
- Update the logic to consider different scenarios in the `stdout` variable returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        partition_spec = ' '.join(["{}='{}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_spec))

        return stdout is not None
```

### Changes Made:
- In the `if partition is None` block, the `show tables` command was updated to fetch all table names without filtering based on `table` name. The return condition now checks if the `table` name is in the list of tables obtained from `stdout.split()`.
- In the `else` block, the partition spec creation was corrected and the return condition was simplified by checking if `stdout` is not None.

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly, enabling it to determine whether the table exists based on the specified database, table name, and optional partition. This updated version should pass the failing test cases.
