The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test cases to fail. The function is not correctly checking if a table exists in the given database and partition. The issue lies in how the stdout output is being checked for determining if a table exists.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not handle the case where the output of the `run_hive_cmd` contains spaces or newlines.
2. When `table in stdout` is checked, it does not account for any additional data that might be present in `stdout` apart from the table name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition for checking table existence based on a more robust method that accounts for additional characters in the output.
2. Ensure that the condition returns True only if the exact table name is found in the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        tables = [line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip()]
        return table in tables

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        partitions = [line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip()]
        return True if partitions else False
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly split the stdout, remove empty lines, and check for the existence of the table or partition based on the exact table or partition name. This fix should ensure that the test cases pass successfully.
