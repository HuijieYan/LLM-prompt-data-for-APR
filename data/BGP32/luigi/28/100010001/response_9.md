## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test due to incorrect logic in handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should return `True` only if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the current implementation, the logic for checking the existence of the table in the output is not correct.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect condition check for table existence in the output.
2. Incorrect format string usage in building the Hive command.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect logic in checking the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The returned value should be checked for table existence before returning `True`.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly check the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should also ensure that the format string for building the Hive command is correct.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By correcting the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function and ensuring that we properly check for table existence in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, we can fix the bug and pass the failing tests.
