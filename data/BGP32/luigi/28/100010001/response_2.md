The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition checking the presence of the table in the output of the command. The current implementation checks for `stdout` only, which might not capture the full table name causing the bug.

To fix the bug:
1. Make sure to split the `stdout` from the command output to individual lines.
2. Check if the table name is present in one of the lines instead of the whole `stdout`.
3. Remove unnecessary conversions or checks for stdout truthiness as they are not relevant to checking if the table exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Corrected `table_exists` function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        stdout_lines = stdout.splitlines()
        
        return any(table in line for line in stdout_lines)

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        stdout_lines = stdout.splitlines()

        return any(stdout_lines)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output into lines and checking if the table name exists in any of the lines, the corrected version should accurately determine whether the table exists. This correction should make the function pass the failing tests.
