## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is called by `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` in the test file. The function is expected to check if a table exists in a given database and return `True` or `False` accordingly.

The error message shows that for both tests, the function is not returning the expected results - `True`.
The issue seems to be in the logic of returning `False` even when the table exists, resulting in failing test cases.

## Bug:
The bug in the function is causing it to return `False` instead of `True` when the table exists. This leads to the failing test cases.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the function returns `True` when the table is found in the output of the Hive command, and `False` otherwise.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None and len(stdout.splitlines()) > 0
```

By splitting the output by lines and using the `in` operator on the list of lines, we can correctly check if the table exists in the database for the first case. And for the partitioned table check, we ensure that the output is not `None` and have more than 0 lines to determine existence. This corrected code should now pass the failing test cases.
