The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is causing the test cases to fail. The function is not handling the condition where the table name is case insensitive. The function is checking for an exact match of `table` in the list of tables returned by `run_hive_cmd` which leads to issues with case sensitivity.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the function to check for case insensitivity when comparing the table names.
2. Update the code to handle variations in case for the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # Handle case-insensitive table name comparison
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split("\n") if t)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. This change will ensure that the function performs as intended, passing the failing test cases.
