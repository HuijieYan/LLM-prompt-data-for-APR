### Analysis:
The function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a database in Hive. The function is failing the test cases because it does not correctly handle the response from the Hive command. The error message indicates that the function is returning incorrect results.

### Identified Error:
The potential error in the function lies in how it handles the output from the Hive command. The function compares the output to determine if the table exists, but the comparison is not accurate as it does not always handle the response correctly. 

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the way it checks the existence of a table based on the output from the Hive command. The function compares the response directly, which can lead to false positives or negatives depending on the exact output structure.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the output from the Hive command to determine whether the table exists. Instead of solely relying on a simple comparison with the response, we should extract the table names from the output and verify if the specified table is present.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        
        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version now splits the table names from the response and checks if the specified table exists within it. This approach ensures more accurate results when checking for table existence. 

By implementing this corrected function, the test cases should pass successfully.
