## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly handle the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning `False` when it should return `True` for existing tables.

## Error Location:
- The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
- In the first part of the `table_exists` function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is used to determine if the table exists. The logical operator `and` is causing issues as it might not behave as expected when `stdout` contains a non-empty string.
- The returned value from `run_hive_cmd` is "OK\nmytable", which is a non-empty string. The logical `and` with that string results in `True`, but it should actually be returning `False` in this case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of using `and` to check if the table is in the output of the command, we can check if the output contains the table name and return `True`. If the table name is not found in the output, we can return `False`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
``` 

By making these adjustments, the `table_exists` function will correctly determine if the table exists and return `True` or `False` accordingly.
