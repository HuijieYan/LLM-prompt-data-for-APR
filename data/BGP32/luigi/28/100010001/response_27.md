### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a given table exists in a specific database.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is returning the incorrect result.
3. The bug is likely related to how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for table existence.
4. A strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that the function correctly interprets the result retrieved from running the Hive command and returns `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it does not.

### Updated and Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and "OK" not in stdout  # Check if stdout contains "OK" for successful table existence

```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.
2. When `partition` is not None, the function now checks for the presence of the `"OK"` string in the `stdout` of the Hive command execution to accurately determine table existence.
3. By returning `False` when `"OK"` is found in the `stdout`, the function ensures that the test cases are validated correctly.
4. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases in the provided error messages.
