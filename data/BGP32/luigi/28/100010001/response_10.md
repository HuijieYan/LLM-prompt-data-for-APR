### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing one of the test cases because the logic inside the function is incorrect. The error message indicates that in the test case, the function is returning `False` instead of `True` even when the table exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional logic inside the function might be incorrectly checking for the presence of tables.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function might not be returning the expected output for checking table existence.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the logic inside the `table_exists` function is not correctly processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. As a result, the function is returning `False` when it should return `True` for an existing table.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional logic to correctly identify if the table exists in the database.
2. Verify that the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being processed accurately.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected function, the logic for checking table existence has been updated to ensure that the output of `run_hive_cmd` is correctly processed. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
