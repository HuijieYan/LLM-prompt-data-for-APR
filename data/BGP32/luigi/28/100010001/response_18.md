## Error Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test is failing when trying to assert that the table does exist when it should be True. This failure is most likely due to a logic issue in the `table_exists` function. Specifically, the conditional statements inside the function might not be evaluating correctly based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Bug Explanation:
1. In the first part of the function where `partition is None`, it checks if the table name exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. However, it does not consider the possibility that the table name might be present in some other part of the output string, leading to incorrect evaluations.

2. In the second part where `partition is not None`, it tries to check if the partition spec exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The same issue as the first part might affect this condition as well.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function in a way that correctly parses the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for the existence of the table or partition in a foolproof manner.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1};""".format(database, table))

        return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.split()
```

In this corrected version, I modified the function to split the output of `run_hive_cmd` by spaces, which allows us to get a list of table names or partition specs. Then, I used the `in` operator to directly check if the table or partition exists in that list. This approach ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of the table or partition based on the actual output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
