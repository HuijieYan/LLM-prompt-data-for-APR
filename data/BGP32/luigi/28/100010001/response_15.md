The issue in the buggy function `table_exists` stems from how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is checking for the presence of the table name in the output to determine if the table exists. However, in the provided error messages, the returned output from `run_command` contains both the table name and additional text, causing the function to incorrectly evaluate the truthiness of the output.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if the table name is in the output string, instead of only checking the truthiness of the output. Additionally, when multiple tables are present in the output, the function should split the output into separate lines and check each line for the existence of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(table == t for t in tables)
    
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(self.partition_spec(partition) == p for p in partitions)
```

This corrected version splits the output into separate lines and checks if the table name exists in any of the lines. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables in the output provided by `run_hive_cmd`.
