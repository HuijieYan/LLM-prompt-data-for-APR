### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a specific table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The error messages indicate that the function is returning incorrect results for table existence.
3. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not.
4. There might be an issue with how the function is parsing the output of the Hive commands to determine table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect parsing of the output from the Hive commands. The function is not properly checking the response from the Hive commands to determine table existence.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Parse the stdout from the Hive commands to check if the table name is present.
2. Modify the conditional statements to correctly identify the presence of the table name in the stdout.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
```

By splitting the `stdout` string before checking if the table name is present, we ensure that each table name is treated as a distinct token. This modification should correctly identify the presence of the table name and fix the bug causing incorrect results.
