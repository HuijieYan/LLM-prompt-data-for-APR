### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` should return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it doesn't. However, in the provided buggy function, both branches of the `if` statement return `False` if the `stdout` is not empty.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the `if stdout` check for both branches of the `if` statement.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because in Python, an empty string evaluates to `False` in a boolean context. Therefore, when the `stdout` variable is not empty, the condition `if stdout` evaluates to `True`. However, the correct logic should be that when the table is found (not empty `stdout`), the function should return `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `if` conditions to correctly handle the presence of tables in the `stdout`.
2. Change the return statements to return `True` when the table is found and `False` when the table is not found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout  # Check if the table is in the stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True
    
```

Now, with the corrected version of the function, the provided test should pass without any assertion errors.
