### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test due to incorrect implementation of the condition checking. The function is comparing the value of `stdout` with a boolean, which is a potential cause of the bug.

### Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Comparison of `stdout` with boolean `True` in the `if` condition.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function returning a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on the presence of `table` in the `stdout` output. The function should not compare `stdout` directly with boolean values as it can lead to incorrect results.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should check if `table` exists in the `stdout` output without comparing it with a boolean. We can use conditional statements to check if `table` exists in the output and return the corresponding result accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we updated the `table_exists` function to check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output using the `in` operator. Additionally, for the case where `partition` is not `None`, we simplified the return statement to directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
