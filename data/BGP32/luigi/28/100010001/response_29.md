## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a database, either with or without a partition.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning incorrect results for existing tables.
3. The bug lies in the conditional statement checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The current implementation does not handle the case where the output includes the table name in addition to other information.
5. The function should check if the specific table name is present in the output.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional statement to specifically check if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Ensure that no other extraneous information in the output leads to incorrect results.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
```

With this modification, the function will split the output by newlines and check if the specific table name is present in the individual lines. This should correctly determine if the table exists in the database, fixing the bug that led to incorrect results in the failing test cases.
