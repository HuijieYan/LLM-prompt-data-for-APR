## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is checking if a table exists in a database using a specific partition.
2. There are discrepancies in the logic of the function, leading to failing test cases.
3. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the correct value when checking if a table exists.
4. The issues seem to be with how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the comparison of the table name.
   
## Potential Bugs:
1. The `stdout` variable is being used in an incorrect way to determine if the table exists.
2. The `table in stdout` check may be incorrect due to variations in the `stdout` content.
3. The condition to return `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` content may not be appropriately handling the case.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the handling of `stdout` to accurately check if the table exists in the database.
2. Use the `splitlines()` method to split the `stdout` into lines for better comparison.
3. Simplify the conditions used for returning `True` or `False` based on the results of the `run_hive_cmd`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using the `splitlines()` method to split the `stdout` into lines, and simplifying the return conditions, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine if the table exists in the database.
