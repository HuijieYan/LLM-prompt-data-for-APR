## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is using `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check if a table exists.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the function returning the correct result when checking table existence.
3. The bug seems to be related to the condition checks and handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
4. The bug might be in how the function checks for the existence of a table in the output of the Hive command.
5. The bug could also be related to how the function handles the `stdout` and the comparison with the table name.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output obtained from the Hive command.
2. Ensure that the function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not.
3. Improve the comparison logic to correctly handle both cases.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

By splitting the output of the Hive command by newline character and properly comparing it, this corrected `table_exists` function should handle the existence check correctly and pass the failing test cases.
