### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The bug arises from directly comparing the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails due to False not being equal to True in the test cases where table names are tested with different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that the check for table existence in Hive is case-insensitive. This modification aligns with the resolution proposed in the GitHub issue and fixes the failing test cases related to table name case sensitivity.
