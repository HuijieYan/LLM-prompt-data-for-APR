### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output obtained from a Hive command, as the comparison is case sensitive.
2. The bug occurs when the table name casing doesn't match the expected casing in the output of the Hive command, leading to false negatives when checking for table existence.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is failing to treat table names in a case-insensitive manner, causing assertions to fail when comparing table names with their lowercase versions.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output is done in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()
``` 

By converting both `stdout.lower().strip()` and `table.lower()` before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.
