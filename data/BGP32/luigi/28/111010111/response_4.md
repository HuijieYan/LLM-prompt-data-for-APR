### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output for the presence of the table.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly.

3. The failing tests expect the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence. The function currently directly checks if the table name is in the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to case sensitivity issues.

4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and align with the expectations of the failing tests.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue mentioned in the failing tests and the GitHub comments.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly check for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
