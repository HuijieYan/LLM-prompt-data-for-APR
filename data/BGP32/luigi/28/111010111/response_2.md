### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given `database`. The issue arises when trying to match the table name with the output returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function when there is a case mismatch.
2. The bug occurs because the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` result is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the case of the table name and output don't match.
3. The error message confirms that the issue lies in the comparison logic of the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` result to lowercase before comparing them.
5. By making the comparison case-insensitive, we can ensure that the function works correctly for tables with different casing.

### Bug Fix:
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Directly return the Boolean value

```

The updated function now converts both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
