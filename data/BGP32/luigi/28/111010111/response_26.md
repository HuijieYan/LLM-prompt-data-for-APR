### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a specified Hive database. The bug arises from not handling case sensitivity properly while comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.
   
2. The issue is related to how the `table_exists` function compares the table name with the output from the Hive command. The comparison should be case insensitive to match the table name regardless of case.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the case sensitivity of comparing the table name directly with the output from the Hive command. When the test cases pass different cases of table names, the comparison fails and leads to the assertion error.

4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function behaves correctly for all table name cases.

### Correction:

```python
# Corrected function with case insensitive comparison
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database, resolving the bug.
