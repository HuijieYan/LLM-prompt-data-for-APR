### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and checks the output to see if the table exists.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. The test is failing because the function is not handling the case of the table name correctly.
3. The function checks if the table name is in the output string from the Hive command, but the comparison is case-sensitive. However, Hive is case-insensitive, so the function needs to handle this appropriately. The failing test cases provide examples where the table name's case causes the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case-insensitive, as expected in the failing test cases.
