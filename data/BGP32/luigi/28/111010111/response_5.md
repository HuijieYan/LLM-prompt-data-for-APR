### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specific database. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
2. The error occurs when the function does not handle the case sensitivity of table names in Hive properly. The test cases show that the function fails in scenarios where the table case does not match with the expected case.
3. The function does not compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, leading to test failures. The `run_hive_cmd` function is expected to return the table names in lowercase, causing mismatches.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison, the function will now handle case sensitivity properly. This should fix the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
