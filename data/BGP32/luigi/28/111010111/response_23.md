### Analysis:

1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. This function checks if a table exists in a specified database by executing a Hive command.
   
2. The potential error lies in the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failures in case the table names have different cases.
   
3. The cause of the bug is that the function compares the table name as is with the table names retrieved from Hive query output, which are in lower case. This mismatch in case leads to incorrect results and test failures. The expected behavior is to make the comparison case-insensitive to handle different cases of table names.
   
4. To fix the bug, the table names should be converted to lowercase before comparison. This way, the comparison will be case-insensitive and match regardless of the case of characters.
   
### Corrected Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the table names from the Hive query output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive table existence checks.
