## Analyzing the buggy function and the related information

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a specific database with optional partition information. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output for validation.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the table name case insensitivity correctly. The buggy function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive commands without considering the case differences, leading to assertion failures in the test cases.

The expected input values for the `table_exists` function include database name, table name, and optional partition information. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise. Additionally, the tests provide specific scenarios where the case-insensitive comparison is critical for the function to work correctly.

The issue in GitHub highlights the importance of making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle situations where table names may differ in case between the code and Hive output.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands without considering case differences.
2. The conditional statements in the function that handle the partition information but do not address case insensitivity.
3. Lack of case-insensitive comparison for table names as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

## Explanation of the bug and the cause

The bug is caused by the function's direct comparison between the provided table name and the output from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity. This results in false negatives when the table names differ only in case, leading to failing test cases.

The GitHub issue suggests that Hive is case insensitive when returning table names, which necessitates a case-insensitive comparison within the `table_exists` function to ensure accurate results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from Hive commands. This involves converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) for comparison.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the output from Hive commands are both converted to lower case before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug and meeting the expectations from the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
