## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence in Hive, but it seems to have a case sensitivity issue.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output for table existence.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function fails when table names are not case-insensitive. The issue on GitHub also mentions the case sensitivity problem.
4. The bug is caused by directly comparing the table name with the output without considering case sensitivity. The function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to address this issue.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output in a case-insensitive manner.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive. This change will address the case sensitivity issue reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass all the provided failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
