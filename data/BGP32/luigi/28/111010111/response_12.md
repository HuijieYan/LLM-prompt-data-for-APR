### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in Hive. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
2. The buggy function fails the test cases due to case sensitivity issues in matching the table names.
3. The root cause of the bug is that the table name comparison is case-sensitive, causing the function to return incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the table name is case-insensitive.
5. We need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Correction

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will resolve the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing tests.
