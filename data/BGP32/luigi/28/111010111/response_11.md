### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in the specified database. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` with different queries based on whether a partition is provided or not. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the output of the Hive command.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to assertion errors when comparing the expected and actual results.

### Error Location
The error likely lies in the comparison part of the `table_exists` function where it checks if the table name exists in the `stdout` variable. This is where the case sensitivity issue is coming into play.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the mismatch in case when comparing the expected table name and the table names returned in the output obtained from the Hive command. Hive is case insensitive, so table names returned by Hive are in lowercase, while the expected table names in the test cases might be in mixed case. The function directly compares the expected table name with the output, leading to false negatives when they do not match due to case differences.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the expected table name and the table names in the `stdout` variable is case insensitive. One way to achieve this is to convert both strings to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This will make the comparison independent of the case of the strings.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the table names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is now case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
