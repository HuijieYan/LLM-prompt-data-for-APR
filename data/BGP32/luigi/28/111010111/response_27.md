### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. The issue arises when the function compares the table name with the output from Hive, leading to a case sensitivity problem.
2. The error message indicates that the test fails when checking the existence of a table due to case sensitivity.
3. The bug is caused by the function not considering the case sensitivity of table names when comparing against the output from Hive commands. This leads to assertions failing when comparing table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence. This change aligns with the suggested fix provided in the GitHub issue #896.
