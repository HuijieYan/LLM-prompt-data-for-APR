### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure when checking for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity issues.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive, which is case sensitive. It should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. We need to modify the function to convert the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are treated as lowercase strings for a case-insensitive comparison.
