### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the database by running a Hive command. The issue arises when the table names are in different cases (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable'), resulting in the test failures due to case sensitivity.
2. The key problem lies in the comparison of the table names retrieved from the Hive command output and the provided table name without considering case sensitivity.
3. The error message indicates that the expected values are not being returned due to the case mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison step to be case-insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function will compare the lowercase versions of table names for accurate results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Lowercase the table name before comparing it with the names retrieved from the Hive command output to make the comparison case-insensitive.
2. Update the return statement accordingly to reflect the correct comparison result.
3. Modify the buggy function to implement the above strategy.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive in the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the function now accurately checks for the existence of tables in a database, resolving the issue of failing tests due to case sensitivity.
