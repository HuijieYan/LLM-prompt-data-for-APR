### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in Hive, but it is case-sensitive, leading to the failing test cases.
2. The issue stems from the comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison fails when the table name case does not match.
3. The failing test cases are failing because when the table name is in different cases than the output from `run_hive_cmd`, the comparison fails.
4. To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison in order to make it case-insensitive.

### Updated Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive table existence checks in Hive.
