### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The bug arises when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
2. The bug is likely in the comparison logic where the table name is compared with the output returned by `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The bug causes the test cases to fail because the comparison of the table name is case sensitive, leading to issues when tables have different casing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. We should update the comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence to ensure case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
