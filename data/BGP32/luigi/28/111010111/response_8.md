### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues. The function is not handling the case insensitivity of the table names correctly.
2. The issue is identified in comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug is causing the function to fail when comparing table names with different case variations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are compared in a case-insensitive manner.
5. Update the buggy function to handle case insensitivity while comparing table names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue identified in the GitHub bug report.
