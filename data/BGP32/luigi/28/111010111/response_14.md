### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using `hive` invocations.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing the test to fail when the table name case doesn't match.
3. The GitHub issue #896 also confirms that this bug relates to case sensitivity and suggests fixing it by making `table_exists` case insensitive.
4. The bug arises due to a direct comparison between the `table` and `stdout`, without considering case differences.
5. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lowercase before comparison to make the check case insensitive.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function becomes case insensitive and should pass the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
