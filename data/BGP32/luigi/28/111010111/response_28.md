### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for table existence in Hive based on the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The failing tests are due to case sensitivity issues with the table names causing the assertion errors.
3. The GitHub issue #896 also explains the issue with case sensitivity in table names and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the table name in `table_exists` function is case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the table name comparison in a case-insensitive manner. This causes the failing tests when the table names are in different cases than expected.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` response to lower case (or upper case) before comparison to make the function case insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and `stdout` responses to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles the case sensitivity issue and should pass the failing tests.
