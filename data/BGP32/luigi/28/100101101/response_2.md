The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to the logic used to check if a table exists in a database. The issue lies in the conditional statements that determine the return value based on the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug occurs because the function checks for the exact presence of the table name in the stdout variable, which causes issues with cases where the table name appears as a substring within other text. This leads to inconsistent behavior and failing tests.

To fix this issue, a better approach would be to split the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any of the resulting lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split("\n")
        return any(table == t for t in tables)

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split("\n")
        return any(partition == p for p in partitions)
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking if the table or partition matches any of the lines, we ensure a more robust and accurate determination of the table existence.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing tests and fulfill the expected input/output values provided.
