The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic that checks for the existence of a table. The function incorrectly returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the `table` is in `stdout` or not.

The buggy function can be corrected by checking if the `table` is in `stdout` before returning `True`. Additionally, for the case where a partition is specified, the function should also check if the partition exists in `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        if stdout and partition_str in stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it should pass all the failing tests provided.

Make sure to test the corrected function thoroughly to ensure its correctness.
