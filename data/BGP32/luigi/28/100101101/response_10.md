### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditions used for checking if a table exists in the database. The function relies on the presence of non-empty `stdout` to determine if a table exists, which is incorrect in some cases.

In the first case, when the `table_exists` function is called with `table='mytable'`, the `stdout` is set to `'OK'`, which causes the function to return `True` even though the table does not actually exist.

In the second case, when the `table_exists` function is called with `table='MyTable'`, the `stdout` is set to `'OK\nmytable'`, leading to the correct detection of the table's existence. However, this case shows that the function is case-sensitive, which might not be the desired behavior.

In the third and fourth cases, when the `table_exists` function is called with additional partition information, the function incorrectly returns `True` for the table's existence even though the output `stdout` does not contain the specific partition information.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the function properly checks for the existence of the table based on the output `stdout`. Additionally, we should address the case sensitivity of table names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()

        return stdout == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function:
- The `stdout` variable is stripped of leading and trailing whitespaces to ensure accurate comparison.
- The function now checks if the `stdout` exactly matches the table name to determine table existence.
- The function now explicitly converts the `stdout` to a boolean value to address the case sensitivity issue.

With these modifications, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and correctly determine the existence of tables in the database.
