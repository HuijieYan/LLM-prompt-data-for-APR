The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which is not accurately determining if the table exists in the output.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to check if the table name appears as a separate line in the `stdout` variable after splitting it based on newline characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version checks if the table name exists in the lines of `stdout` after splitting it. This modification ensures that the function correctly determines if the table exists based on the output of the command.

By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
