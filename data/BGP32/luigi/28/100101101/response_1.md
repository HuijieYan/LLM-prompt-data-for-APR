The buggy function has an issue where it incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug lies in the condition where it checks if the table is in the stdout, as it does not handle the case with multiple tables correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table is a complete match in the stdout. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the output by newline and then checking if the table is in the list of tables, we can accurately determine if the table exists. This correction ensures that the function properly handles cases where multiple tables are returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
