The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it evaluates the presence of a table or partition in Hive. The bug stems from the fact that the function evaluates whether the stdout variable contains the table/partition name, but it does not account for case sensitivity.

There are two main issues to address:
1. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table/partition existence.
2. The function conditionally returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of the table/partition in the output, but it should standardize the comparison by converting both to lowercase.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to ensure case insensitivity when comparing the table/partition names. Additionally, we should normalize the comparison by converting both the table/partition names and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making these adjustments, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and normalize the comparison, ensuring that the tests pass as expected.
