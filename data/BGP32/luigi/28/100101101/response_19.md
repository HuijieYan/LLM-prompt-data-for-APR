The bug in the provided function lies in how the function handles the stdout variable and checks for the existence of the table. The function checks if the table name is in the stdout output, but due to how the stdout is handled, it may not correctly identify the table existence.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to split the stdout based on newlines and then check if the table name is present in the split lines. This approach will provide a more accurate check for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Checking if stdout has a value
```

With this modification, the function now correctly splits the stdout based on newlines before checking for the table name existence. This change should address the issue and make the function pass the failing test cases.
