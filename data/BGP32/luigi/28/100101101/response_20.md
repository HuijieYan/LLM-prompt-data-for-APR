The bug in the function `table_exists` lies in the conditional check for whether the `table` exists in the result obtained from running the Hive command. The function incorrectly checks if the `table` is in the entire output, rather than line by line. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the table name matches part of a larger string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the check to iterate over each line of the `stdout` and check if the `table` exists in any of the lines.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This updated version splits the `stdout` by newline characters and then checks if the `table` exists in any of the lines. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies the presence of the `table` name in the Hive command output.

This corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
