### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has two main branches based on the presence of a `partition` parameter. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the returned value from the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks whether the table exists. In the failing test cases, the function is not handling the `stdout` value correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first failing test case, `stdout` is set to `'OK'`, but the function expects the table name to be present in the `stdout` which causes the check `table in stdout` to fail, leading to a `False` return when it should have been `True`.
2. In the second failing test case, even though the `stdout` contains the table name `'mytable'`, it is set to `'OK\nmytable'`, which does not match the logic of the function for table existence check, leading to an incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic of the function to correctly handle the `stdout` value returned by `run_hive_cmd` and perform the table existence check accordingly in both branches of the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- In the first branch without partition, we split the `stdout` by newline character and then check if the `table` exists in the list of tables.
- In the second branch with partition, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout`, which will be `True` if it's not empty.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
