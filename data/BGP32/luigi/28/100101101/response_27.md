The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checks when determining whether a table exists or not. The function is currently returning the result of the condition directly, which may not always be correct. Instead, we should be checking if the table exists based on the presence of the table name in the output of the hive command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the function to properly check for the existence of the table. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` by newline character to get individual table names and then check if the target table is present in the list.
- We return a boolean value indicating whether the table exists or not.

This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly based on the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.
