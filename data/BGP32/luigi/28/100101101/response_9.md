The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison of the `table` name in the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` variable directly, but it should consider that there might be additional characters in the `stdout` variable that could cause the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the check to ensure that the `table` name is a separate entity within the `stdout` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable on newline characters, we ensure that we are only comparing the `table` name itself. This modification will resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases.
