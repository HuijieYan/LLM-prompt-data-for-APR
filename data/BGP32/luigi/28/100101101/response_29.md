The bug in the provided function is likely due to incorrect handling of the stdout response when checking for table existence. The function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout without considering the formatting of the stdout response.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the stdout response and check for the table name in a more robust way.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    if partition:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3})""".format(database,
                                                                                             database, table,
                                                                                             self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We split the stdout response when checking for table existence to properly handle cases where there are multiple table names in the response.
2. When dealing with partitions, we construct the command to show partitions in a more precise manner, ensuring the correct format for the query.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
