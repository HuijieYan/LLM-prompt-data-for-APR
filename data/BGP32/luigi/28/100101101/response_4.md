The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic for checking the presence of the table or partition in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The current implementation checks if the entire table name or partition string exists in the output, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic to ensure that each table or partition entry in the output is checked individually for a match. This way, we accurately determine if the table or partition exists based on each entry in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(partition == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

With this updated logic that checks each line in the output separately, the function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
