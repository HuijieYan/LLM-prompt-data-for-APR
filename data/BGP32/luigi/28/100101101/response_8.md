The buggy function fails to appropriately check if a table exists in a database. The issue arises from how the function handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout`, leading to failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the `stdout` returned by `run_hive_cmd` and check for the existence of the table in a correct manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if the `table` exists in the resulting list, addressing the issue in the original function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
