The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking for the presence of the table in the output `stdout`. The function incorrectly returns `True` if the output contains the table name as a substring, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

To address this issue, the function should check if the table name is present as a full word in the output `stdout`. This can be achieved by using regular expressions to ensure an exact match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(table) + r'\b', stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The above corrected function uses the `re.search` method with the regular expression `\b` to match the table name as a whole word, ensuring that false positives are avoided.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
