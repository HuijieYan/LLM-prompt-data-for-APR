The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function currently relies on the presence of the table name in the output of the Hive command ('show tables like...'). However, this method fails in cases where the table name is a substring of another table name in the output.

The strategy to fix this bug is to modify the function to specifically check if the exact table name exists in the output, rather than just being a substring. This can be achieved by splitting the output of the Hive command by newline characters and then directly comparing each line against the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters, we ensure that we are comparing the exact table name against each line. This correction should allow the function to pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
