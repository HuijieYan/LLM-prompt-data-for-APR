The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists. The function checks if the `stdout` variable is truthy, which is not the correct way to verify if the table is present.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the table name is in the `stdout` variable for the cases where the output contains table information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split("\n") if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return True if stdout else False
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if the table name is in the list of tables when no partition is specified. When a partition is provided, it simply checks if `stdout` has any content.

By using these checks, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
