The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` output. The function checks if the `table` name is in `stdout` as a whole, which causes issues when there are other tables listed along with the target table in `stdout`. To fix this, we need to modify the comparison logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters, we can properly check if the `table` exists in the list. This change ensures that the function behaves as expected based on the provided failing tests and the expected input/output values.
