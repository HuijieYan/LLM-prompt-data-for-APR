The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the `stdout` contains the `table` name using the expression `table in stdout`, which is flawed since `stdout` might contain other data as well, leading to false positives.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to split the lines in `stdout` and then check if the `table` is in those lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables if t.strip())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by newline character `\n` to get individual lines and then check if the `table` exists in any of those lines. This approach ensures that only exact matches are considered when checking for the existence of the table.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
