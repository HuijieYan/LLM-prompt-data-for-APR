The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the way the function checks for the existence of a table. The issue lies in the check for the table name in the `stdout` variable. The buggy function is checking for an exact match, but it should be checking if the table name is present in the output. This can be fixed by modifying the condition to use the `in` operator.

To correct the bug in the `table_exists` function, we can update the `if` condition as follows:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout) and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This correction ensures that the function correctly checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the Hive command. With this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
