### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not performing a case-insensitive check when verifying the existence of tables in Hive.
- The GitHub issue highlighted the problem where table names with different case formatting were causing the test to fail.
- The suggested fix in the GitHub issue recommends checking `table.lower()` in the `stdout` to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.
2. The `stdout` might contain table names in lowercase format.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity. When checking for the existence of a table in Hive, it's essential to consider the case of the table name provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive. Specifically, convert both the table name and the content in `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This solution addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and provides a more robust behavior for the function `table_exists`.
