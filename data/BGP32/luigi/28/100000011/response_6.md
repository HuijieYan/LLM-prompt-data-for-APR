### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file of the Luigi library is causing an issue where table existence checks are case-sensitive, leading to failures when tables are defined with different casing in Hive. The GitHub issue #896 has been raised to address this problem by making the table existence check case-insensitive.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison between the table name and the stdout in the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case sensitivity of table names when comparing them with the output from the Hive command. This causes failures when the table names are defined with different casing in Hive compared to the input table name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be made case-insensitive by converting both strings to lower case before the comparison. This will prevent failures due to differences in casing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, this corrected version of the function ensures that the table existence check is now case-insensitive, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
