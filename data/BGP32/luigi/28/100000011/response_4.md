**Analysis:**
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case-insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This causes an issue when comparing the input table name with the tables found in Hive, as Hive returns table names in lowercase.

**Error Locations:**
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive, causing an incorrect result when checking for table existence.
2. There is no case-insensitive comparison implemented in the current function.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug occurs due to the function's failure to account for case sensitivity when comparing the input table name with the names retrieved from Hive. As a result, the function may return an incorrect result if the case of the table name does not match exactly with the table name stored in Hive.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the input table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This change will ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in case.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the function, the input table name `table` is converted to lowercase using `table.lower()` before comparing it with the tables retrieved from Hive. Additionally, the tables retrieved from Hive are also converted to lowercase using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
