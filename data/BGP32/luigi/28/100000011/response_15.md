### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file checks if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name to the output from Hive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `table` with `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
2. The handling of the table name comparison in different paths of the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not being case insensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive. Hive is case insensitive, so table names may be returned in different cases than what was provided. This leads to incorrect results when comparing the provided table name to the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the provided table name and the output should be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Updated Function:
In the corrected version, both the provided `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` function. This ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the Hive database.
