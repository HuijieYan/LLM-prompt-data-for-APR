### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This leads to issues where table names are compared in a case-sensitive manner, causing tests to fail when the case of the table name doesn't match.

### Identification of potential error locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` or `table` with `table.lower()` is where the case sensitivity issue arises.
2. There is inconsistency in how the function handles table names with partitions.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function directly compares the table name provided with the output from Hive without performing any case normalization. This leads to failures when the cases don't match due to Hive being case-insensitive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To resolve this bug, it is essential to make the comparison case-insensitive by normalizing the cases of both the table name and the output from Hive before comparison. By ensuring that both are in the same case, the comparison will be accurate regardless of the original casing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table` with `stdout` is changed to `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()` to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This adjustment ensures that the table names are compared irrespective of their case, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
