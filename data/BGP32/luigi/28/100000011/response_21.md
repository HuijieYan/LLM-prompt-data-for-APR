### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem where tables defined with capitalized names might not match the lowercase names returned by Hive, causing test failures.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the `table` name and `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to potential mismatches.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity for table name comparisons.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not accounting for case sensitivity in table name comparisons. Hive is case insensitive, but the function performs a direct comparison without considering case differences. This results in test failures when checking for table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables returned by Hive is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the tables returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and eliminates mismatches due to case differences.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
2. The updated comparison ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.
3. The `return bool(stdout)` statement is simplified to return the boolean value of `stdout`.

This corrected version addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that table existence checks in Hive are performed accurately.
