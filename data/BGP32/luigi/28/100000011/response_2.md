## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file of the `luigi` library is not case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This causes issues when tables are defined with different case formats (e.g., capitalized vs. lowercase). The GitHub issue suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to address this problem.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.
2. The comparison of `table.lower() in stdout` is missing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the Hive table names that are returned in lowercase, causing a mismatch in case formats.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the actual table names retrieved from Hive is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the names retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase before the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
