### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is causing an issue where the table existence check is case-sensitive, leading to problems when dealing with capitalized table names in Hive. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking against the lowercase version of the table name.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the table name directly without considering case sensitivity.
2. Not converting the table name to lowercase for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the tables listed in Hive output without converting them to lowercase. This causes a mismatch in cases, leading to false negatives in table existence checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the provided table name and the tables listed in the Hive output to lowercase before comparison. By doing so, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Updated Changes:
1. Convert the provided `table` name to lowercase: `table.lower()`
2. Convert the tables listed in the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison in a list comprehension: `[t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]`
3. Use the `in` keyword to check if the lowercase `table` exists in a list of lowercase tables obtained from `stdout`.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of tables in Hive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
