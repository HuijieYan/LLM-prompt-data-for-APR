### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is designed to check if a table exists in a specified database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function is case sensitive when comparing the table name from `stdout` with the provided `table` parameter, leading to failures when the case doesn't match.

### Identified Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison between the `table` and the table names retrieved from `stdout`. The comparison does not account for case differences, leading to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the table names retrieved from `stdout` in Hive. As Hive is case insensitive, this leads to discrepancies and false negatives during the table existence check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both table names to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of a table regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in [x.lower() for x in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the table names retrieved from `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and aligns with the expected behavior of Hive.
