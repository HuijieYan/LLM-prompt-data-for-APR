### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes an issue when the table names are defined with different cases than what Hive returns. The GitHub issue points out that the table names may be capitalized, but Hive returns them in lower case, leading to test failures.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` or `table, table.lower() in stdout` is case sensitive and does not account for different cases of table names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `table_exists` function in the `hive.py` file does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This leads to inconsistencies between the actual table names in Hive and the names used for comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the tables returned by Hive to ignore case differences. One approach is to convert both the table name and the tables returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the tables returned by Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`. This ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
