### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This leads to issues when comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `table` and `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
2. Inconsistent handling of case in table names between the function and actual Hive database.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the function not taking into account that Hive is case-insensitive when comparing table names. The function directly compares the input table name with the output from Hive, leading to false negatives due to case discrepancies.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can avoid issues related to case sensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Converted both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`.
- This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and the function will return the correct result irrespective of the case of the table name.

By implementing this corrected version of the function, we address the issue raised in GitHub about making `table_exists` case-insensitive.
