## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the Luigi library is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This can lead to issues where the table names may be in different cases between Luigi and Hive, causing the function to return incorrect results.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command not being case insensitive.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not consider the case sensitivity of the table names when comparing them with the output from Hive. This leads to false negatives when checking for table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```

In the corrected version of the function:
- The `table` name is converted to lowercase using `table.lower()`.
- The output `stdout` from the Hive command is split into a list of strings, each converted to lowercase using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`.
- The comparison `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())` ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.

By implementing these changes, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive, addressing the GitHub issue and fixing the bug.
