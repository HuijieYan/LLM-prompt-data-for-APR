### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This results in the function failing when trying to find tables with capitalized names as Hive returns table names in lowercase.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive.
2. The function does not handle the case where the table names are in different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case sensitivity in table names while checking for their existence in the Hive database. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, the comparison fails when the original table name is provided in a different case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version above, both the `table` and the `stdout` from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` function. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
