### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of `luigi` package checks whether a table exists in a Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case-insensitive because Hive is case-insensitive in table name comparisons. The problem arises when the function checks for a table that is capitalized in the code but returned in lowercase by Hive, causing the test to fail.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The potential error in the current implementation lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the lowercase `stdout` returned by Hive.

### Explanation of the bug cause:
The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail when the capitalization of the table name does not match the returned table name from Hive.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to lowercase both the `table` name and the `stdout` before comparison to make the operation case-insensitive. This will ensure that the comparison is consistent regardless of the case.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout
```

### Explanation of the corrected version:
In the corrected version of the function, both the `table` name and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `.lower()` method. This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug reported on GitHub regarding the table existence check in Hive being case-sensitive.
