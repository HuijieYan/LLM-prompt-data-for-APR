### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing issues with case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The problem arises because Hive is case insensitive, but the function is performing a direct string comparison without considering case differences. This leads to false negatives when checking for the existence of tables with different casing.

### Error Locations:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case sensitive.
2. In the `else` block, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is also case sensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case sensitivity in Hive table names. When checking for the existence of a table, the function performs a direct comparison between the input table name and the tables retrieved from Hive. However, since Hive is case insensitive, this direct string comparison fails when the casing of the table names differs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make `table_exists` case insensitive, the function needs to convert both the input table name and the retrieved table names to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables regardless of the casing used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.strip().split("\n"))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the input table name `table` and the table names retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.strip().split("\n"))`. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.
