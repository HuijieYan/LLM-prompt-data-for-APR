### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` within the `hive.py` file in the `luigi` library is not case-insensitive when checking for table existence. This behavior causes issues when comparing table names with different case formats.

### Error Locations:
The buggy function does not handle table name cases appropriately when comparing. It can lead to false negatives as MySQL is case-insensitive for table names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the direct comparison of table names without normalizing the case. When the table name case does not match the case in the actual database, the function erroneously reports that the table does not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the queried table name and the table names in the database is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both table names to a standardized case before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in [name.lower() for name in stdout.split('\n') if name.strip()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The table names are converted to lowercase using `lower()` for comparison.
- The `stdout` is split by newline character and processed to handle different cases of table names.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and address the issue raised on GitHub about making the function case-insensitive.
