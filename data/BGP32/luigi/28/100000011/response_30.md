### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. The issue mentioned on GitHub indicates that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase causing the function to fail.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison for table existence is case sensitive.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity for table names correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function `table_exists` does not take into account case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive with the provided table name. This results in false negatives when checking for table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive. By converting both names to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. Use `table.lower()` before checking if it exists in the retrieved table names to make the comparison case insensitive.
2. Modify the check to utilize `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert all table names to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
3. Simplify the `if` condition to return `bool(stdout)` directly for partitioned tables.
