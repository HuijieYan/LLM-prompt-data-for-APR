### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This issue was reported on GitHub where tables defined with capitalized names were failing the test due to case sensitivity in the comparison between the `table` variable and the output in `stdout`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The comparison between the `table` and `stdout` variables is case sensitive.
- The code does not handle the case where the table name in `table` is provided with different capitalization.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the `table` and the output fetched from `stdout`. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, the comparison fails for tables with different capitalization.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` and the output from `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This way, the comparison will be case insensitive and match regardless of the table name's capitalization.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
- Converted both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it case insensitive.
- Instead of explicitly checking for `True` or `False`, cast the `stdout` variable to a boolean using `bool()` to simplify the return statement.
- Removed the unnecessary `if-else` structure as the behavior is the same in both cases after fixing the case sensitivity issue.
