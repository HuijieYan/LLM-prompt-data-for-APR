### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` as mentioned in the GitHub issue is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This causes issues when comparing different case formats of table names, leading to test failures.

### Error Locations:
1. The function does not utilize case-insensitive comparison when checking the table name against the stdout.
2. Lack of consideration for different case formats of table names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the function's direct comparison between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive, without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the provided table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Description:
In the corrected version, both the provided `table` name and the table names retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
