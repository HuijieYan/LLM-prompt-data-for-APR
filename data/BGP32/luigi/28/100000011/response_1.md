### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue on GitHub highlights that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, but Hive returns them as lowercase. This causes the function to incorrectly determine if a table exists or not.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the `table` and `stdout` in the `else` block.
2. The way the comparison is done in the `if partition is None` block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the given table name and the output from Hive without considering the case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives when trying to determine if a table exists in Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the Hive output case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we can make the function `table_exists` case insensitive and correctly determine if a table exists in Hive regardless of the case used in the table name definition.
