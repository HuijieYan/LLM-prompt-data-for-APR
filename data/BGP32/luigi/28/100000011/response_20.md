Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Comparing the table name directly to the stdout without considering case sensitivity.
2. The function does not handle case sensitivity as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the lack of handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. When comparing the table name with the output from Hive, there is a case mismatch leading to the function returning false negatives.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the function is now case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue.
