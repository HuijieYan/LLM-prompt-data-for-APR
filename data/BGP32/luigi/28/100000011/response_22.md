### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not case-insensitive when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This bug is related to the GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive". The issue description highlights the problem of having tables with capitalized names but being returned in lowercase by Hive, causing the table existence check to fail.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive and can lead to false negative results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `table_exists` function does not consider the case sensitivity of table names returned by Hive, leading to failures when checking for table existence with capitalized names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this issue, we need to convert the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison with the `stdout` result. By making the comparison case-insensitive, we can avoid false negatives when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Converted both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison in the `table_exists` function.
2. Removed unnecessary if-else logic and simplified the return statement when checking for partitions.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function now accurately checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
