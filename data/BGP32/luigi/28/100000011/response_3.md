### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the Luigi library is causing issues related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The GitHub issue highlights that tables defined in capitalized format are not being correctly identified due to the case insensitivity of Hive returning them in lowercase.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` response may be case-sensitive, leading to incorrect evaluation.
2. The lack of case insensitivity handling in the function may result in false negatives when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function `table_exists` does not account for case sensitivity in the comparison between the provided table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` response from Hive. This results in incorrect evaluations, especially when dealing with tables defined in capitalized format.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the table existence check case-insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic in the function. The function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables listed in the `stdout` response.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the comparison in the `if` block to check for the lowercase version of the table name in the lowercase version of tables listed in the `stdout` response.
2. Used `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert all table names in the `stdout` response to lowercase for comparison.
3. Simplified the `else` block to directly return `bool(stdout)` for partitioned tables.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
