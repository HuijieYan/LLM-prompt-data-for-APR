### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file does not take into account case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive. This leads to failures when checking for existing tables with different cases.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is located in the `if partition is None` block of the function, where the comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive is case-sensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing table names. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, tables defined with different cases might not match due to the case sensitivity of table comparisons in Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the tables retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`. This way, the comparison is made in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
