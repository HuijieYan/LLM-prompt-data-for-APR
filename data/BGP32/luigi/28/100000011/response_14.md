### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This leads to potential issues when comparing the table name against the output from Hive, especially if the table names are in different cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to mismatches.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity for table name comparisons.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises from the function not converting both `table` and `stdout` to the same case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. Hive is case insensitive, so a case-insensitive comparison should be used to check if a table exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the `table` name and the `stdout` output from Hive are in the same case before the comparison. Converting both to lowercase or uppercase will ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for the existence of a table in Hive. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and resolves the case sensitivity bug in the `table_exists` function.
