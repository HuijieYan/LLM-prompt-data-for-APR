### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for existing tables in Hive. The issue raised on GitHub suggests that table names can be in different cases, but Hive is case insensitive, leading to failures in the test due to case mismatches between the expected table name and the actual one returned by Hive. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the expected table name and the table name extracted from `stdout` may not consider the case sensitivity.
2. The function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` performing a direct string comparison between the expected table name and the one returned by Hive without considering case sensitivity. As Hive is case insensitive, the comparison can fail due to differences in the case of the table names.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the expected table name and the extracted table name to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the comparison to convert both the expected table name and the table names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Used `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert all table names in `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle case insensitive comparisons when checking for existing tables in Hive.
