### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file needs to be fixed to make it case insensitive when checking table existence in Hive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name with the `stdout` output is case sensitive.
2. The function does not handle the case where the table name in Hive might be different case-wise compared to the input table name.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function in its current state does a direct check between the table name provided and the returned `stdout` from Hive. If the table name provided is not in the exact case as in Hive, the check fails and the function returns false even if the table exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Converted the input `table` name to lowercase before comparison.
- Converted the `stdout` output from Hive to lowercase before comparison using `map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())`.
- Ensured that the comparison is case insensitive to avoid issues with different capitalization. 

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now work as expected and be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.
