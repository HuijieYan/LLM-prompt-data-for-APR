## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in Hive, but it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly. The GitHub issue points out that sometimes tables are defined with capitalized names, which are returned as lowercase by Hive. Therefore, the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to account for this behavior.

## Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` or `table.lower() in stdout` is case-sensitive and will fail if the table name is defined differently in the Hive metadata.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the case sensitivity in comparing the table name provided with the table names returned by Hive in lowercase. Due to this, even if the table exists with a different case, the function will fail to detect it.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the names returned by Hive to lowercase or uppercase, we can ensure a consistent comparison and accurately determine if the table exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())` ensures that the table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner with the table names returned by Hive. This modification addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
