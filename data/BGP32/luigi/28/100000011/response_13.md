### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue Relationship
The buggy function `table_exists()` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given Hive database. The GitHub issue highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking table names. The problem is that the function currently performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output from Hive, causing failures when table names are provided in a different case.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` in the first part of the function may lead to case sensitivity issues.
2. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` in the second part of the function may also suffer from case sensitivity problems.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the function's reliance on case-sensitive string comparison when checking for existing tables. In Hive, table names are case-insensitive, leading to failures in the function when the case of the table name and the returned table names differ.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparisons to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the table names from the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

### Explanation of Changes
1. Converted `table` and `stdout` to lowercase when checking for table existence.
2. Simplified the return statement to directly return the boolean result of `stdout`.

By making these changes, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons when checking for existing tables in Hive, addressing the issue described in the GitHub comments.
