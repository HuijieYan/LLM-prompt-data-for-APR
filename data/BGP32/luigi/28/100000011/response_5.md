### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. This causes issues when the table names have different cases between the code and the actual database. The GitHub issue suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve this problem.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. When comparing the table name with the output from Hive, the function does not handle case sensitivity.
2. Not considering the case insensitivity of Hive when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false negative results when the cases do not match between the code and the actual Hive database.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Converted both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing in the return statements.
- This change ensures case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

By making these modifications to the `table_exists` function, the issue reported on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of table existence checks in Hive should be resolved.
