## Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database.
2. There are two code paths based on the presence of a partition, and different queries are executed accordingly.
3. The bug might be due to incorrect query construction or handling of the stdout check.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring the query construction is correct, and handling the returned stdout appropriately.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function lies in the incorrect query construction when checking for the existence of a partitioned table. The query being used to check the partitions is missing the 'like' clause in the `show partitions` command, which would match partitions based on the provided specs.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the query for checking partitions using the `like` clause and handle the stdout appropriately to determine the existence of the partition.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} like '{2}%';""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
1. For non-partitioned tables, the query checks for the existence of the table using `show tables like "{table}";`.
2. For partitioned tables, the query matches partitions using `show partitions {table} like '{partition}%';`.
3. The stdout is checked appropriately to determine the existence of the table or partition.
4. The bug in query construction for partition checking has been addressed.
