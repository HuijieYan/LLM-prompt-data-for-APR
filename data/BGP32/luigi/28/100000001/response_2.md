## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks whether a table or partition exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive queries and check the output for the existence of the table or partition.

## Identified Issues:
1. When checking for table existence, the function uses `show tables like "{1}"` which may not return an exact match for the table name. It can potentially return multiple similar table names.
2. When checking for partition existence, the function builds the query using `%s` placeholders but misses the actual partition values.
3. The function does not handle errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of Hive commands.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function arises due to incorrect query construction and handling of partition values. Additionally, the approach to checking table existence using `show tables like` can lead to false positives if there are multiple similar table names.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. For checking table existence, use a more precise query to ensure an exact match on the table name.
2. For checking partition existence, construct the query properly with the actual partition values included.
3. Implement error handling to capture any exceptions that may occur during Hive command execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
import subprocess

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        cmd = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
        return True if stdout else False

def run_hive_cmd(cmd):
    try:
        result = subprocess.check_output(['hive', '-e', cmd], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        return result.decode('utf-8')
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return None

```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the queries are constructed more accurately for checking table and partition existence. The `run_hive_cmd` function now includes error handling to capture any exceptions that may occur during the execution of Hive commands.
