## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function takes parameters for the table name, database name, and optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the presence of the table.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect formatting of the Hive commands containing `{}` or `%s`.
2. Inconsistent usage of `run_hive_cmd` for different SQL queries.
3. Inadequate error handling for the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect usage of string formatting in the Hive commands. The faulty formatting could lead to malformed queries that may result in errors when trying to check for table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper formatting of the Hive commands using correct placeholders for string interpolation.
2. Use consistent formatting for both SQL queries within the function.
3. Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions thrown by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we fixed the string formatting in the Hive commands by using proper placeholders. Additionally, we removed unnecessary complexity from the boolean check and improved readability. We also removed redundant `if` conditions for returning `True` or `False`. Now the function should function correctly without errors and return the expected results.
