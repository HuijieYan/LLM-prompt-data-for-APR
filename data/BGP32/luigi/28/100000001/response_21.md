## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It takes parameters `table`, `database`, and optional `partition`. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. In the first `if` statement, the command `show tables like "{1}"` may not correctly check for the table's existence.
2. In the `else` block, the command `show partitions` may not correctly check for the existence of a specific partition.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may arise from incorrect Hive commands being used in the `if` and `else` blocks. Additionally, the condition checking for `stdout` in the `if` block may produce unexpected results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the Hive command in the `if` block to properly check for a specific table, not just similar names.
2. Verify the Hive command in the `else` block to correctly check for the existence of specific partitions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The Hive command in the `if` block has been updated to `show tables in {1}` to check for an exact match of the table name.
- The Hive command in the `else` block remains the same as the buggy version.

This corrected version should address the bug by using the correct Hive commands and conditions to correctly check for the existence of tables and partitions.
