## Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database in Hive.
2. There are two main potential error locations in the code:
   a. The first potential error location is when constructing the query to check if the table exists.
   b. The second potential error location is when constructing the query to show partitions for the table based on the partition information provided.
3. The bug seems to originate from incorrect query construction for both cases. In the condition where no partition is provided, the query lacks the proper format to check if the table exists. In the condition where a partition is provided, the query to show partitions is not constructed accurately.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the query format in both cases to properly check for the existence of the table and partitions.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show table {1} like '{2}' partition ({3});".format(database, table, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected version:
- When no partition is provided, the query format has been adjusted to properly show tables in the specified database and look for the table.
- When a partition is provided, the query format has been corrected to show partitions for the table and the corresponding partition information.

Ensure to test this corrected version to verify its functionality and accuracy.
