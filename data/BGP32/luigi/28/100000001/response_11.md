## Analysis:
This buggy function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function takes in the table name, database name, and an optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands to check for the table's existence.

## Potential Errors:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined within the scope of this function. 
2. In the case where partition is not None, the query construction is incorrect, leading to a syntax error.
3. The usage of the partition_spec method is unclear and may lead to errors.

## Cause of Bug:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be properly implemented to execute Hive commands and return the output.
2. Incorrect syntax in constructing the Hive command query when partition is not None.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and return the output.
2. Fix the query construction in the 'else' block when partition is not None.
3. Ensure that the `partition_spec` method is correctly implemented and used in the query construction.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function:

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Define the `run_hive_cmd` function outside of this function.
2. Correct the query construction for the 'else' block when partition is not None.
3. Ensure that the string formatting is appropriately done using `.format()` method.
4. Eliminate the unnecessary if-else conditions when returning the result. Use `bool(stdout)` to determine the existence based on the returned stdout.
