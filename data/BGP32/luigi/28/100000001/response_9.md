## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to determine whether a table exists in a Hive database. It takes parameters such as `table`, `database`, and `partition` to construct a Hive query and check the existence of the table.

## Potential Errors:
1. Incorrect hive query construction
2. Incorrect comparison logic for determining table existence

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises due to the incorrect construction of the Hive query in the `else` block when `partition` is not None. The query should check for partitions, but the syntax and logic are incorrect, leading to potential errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the Hive query constructed is valid and correctly checks for the existence of the table or partition.
2. Improve the comparison logic to accurately determine the existence of the table or partition based on the query execution output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout 
```

In the corrected version, the `else` block now simply returns the `stdout` value received from the Hive query. This modification simplifies the logic and ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of the table or partition based on the query output.
