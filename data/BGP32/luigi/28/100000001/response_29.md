1. Analyze the buggy function:
   - The function `table_exists` is intended to check if a specific table exists in a Hive database. It accepts parameters such as table name, database name, and an optional partition. The function internally runs a Hive command to check for table existence.

2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The main issue in the buggy function is the use of the `%s` string formatting operator without properly providing the values required for substitution. This can lead to incorrect substitutions and faulty Hive commands.

3. Explain the cause of the bug using the buggy function:
   - In the `else` block of the function, the problematic line is:
     ```python
     stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
     ```
   - The `%s` placeholders are not substituted correctly, potentially causing syntax errors in the Hive command.

4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
   - To fix the bug, we need to use proper string formatting techniques that avoid syntax errors in the Hive commands generated within the function. Using Python's string format method or f-strings can help achieve this.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The correct string formatting technique has been used to generate the Hive command.
- The use of `%s` has been replaced with `{0}` for database, `{1}` for table, and `{2}` for the partition.
- The final result is converted to a boolean value to return `True` or `False` based on the output.

By making these corrections, the function should now operate correctly without syntax errors in the Hive commands.
