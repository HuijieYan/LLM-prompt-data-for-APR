## Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` is taking in parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`.
2. It runs a Hive command to check if a table exists in the specified database.
3. The issue is the use of `and` in the first return statement, which will not account for all possible cases where the table may exist.
4. The `else` block seems to be correct in terms of checking for partitions.
5. The current function does not handle errors or exceptions from running Hive commands, so error handling might be needed.

## Error Location:
The bug is in the `return stdout and table in stdout` statement where using `and` can lead to incorrect results. The function should check if `table` is present in `stdout` and return a boolean accordingly.

## Cause:
The use of `and` in the return statement tries to combine the existence of `stdout` and `table`, which may not work as intended. It needs to specifically check if the `table` is in the output of the Hive command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `table` is present in the retrieved output from the Hive command.
2. Modify the return statement to explicitly check for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`.
3. Add error handling to deal with exceptions or errors that may occur during the Hive command execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
