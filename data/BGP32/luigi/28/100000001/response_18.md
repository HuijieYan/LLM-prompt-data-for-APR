The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given Hive database. However, there are potential errors in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined within the `table_exists` function, which could cause a NameError when the function is called.

2. In the else block, the query for checking partition existence has incorrect formatting, which may lead to errors in querying partitions.

3. There is inconsistency in handling the return values - the function uses different methods (checking for stdout and then return or directly returning True/False) to indicate table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is properly defined, fix the formatting error in the else block, and maintain consistency in how table existence is checked and returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None and len(stdout.split()) > 0
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the formatting of the Hive commands, used the `split` method to properly handle the output, and ensured consistency in return values for table existence checking.
