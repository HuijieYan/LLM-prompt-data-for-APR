## Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to check if a table exists in a specific Hive database. The function checks if the `partition` parameter is None and then uses a Hive command to show tables. If the `partition` parameter is not None, the function shows the partitions for the specified table. However, there are potential issues in the handling of the Hive commands and the logic for returning table existence.

## Identified Errors:
1. In the part where `partition` is None, the Hive command seems to be incorrect.
2. In the else part where `partition` is not None, the syntax of the Hive command is not clear.
3. The logic for returning `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` variable could be simplified.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect Hive commands being used to check for table existence or partitions, leading to incorrect handling of stdout and hence incorrect return values.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the Hive command syntax to correctly show tables when `partition` is None.
2. Revise the Hive command syntax in the `else` part to show partitions properly.
3. Simplify the logic for returning `True` or `False` based on the stdout variable.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            "use {}; show partitions {} partition({});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The Hive command for showing tables has been corrected using `"show tables in"` instead of `"show tables like"`.
2. The Hive command for showing partitions has been reformatted to display partitions properly.
3. The logic for returning `True` or `False` has been simplified using the `bool()` function to directly convert `stdout` to a Boolean value.
