## Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` checks whether a table exists in a given database and partition.
2. When `partition` is None, it checks for the table existence only based on the table name.
3. When `partition` is not None, it constructs a query to check for the existence of the table and partition combination.
4. The bug may exist in how `stdout` is being checked in the `if` condition.

## Bug:
The bug in the function exists in the conditions where the existence of the table or partition is checked based on the `stdout` variable. The function does not correctly handle the case where `stdout` might be empty, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to validate the `stdout` variable properly to handle cases where it might be empty due to a lack of records returned by the Hive command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)

```

In the corrected version, we use `bool(stdout)` to directly convert the `stdout` variable to a boolean value. This way, it will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty (contains some data) and `False` if `stdout` is empty. This correction ensures proper handling of the case when no results are returned by the Hive command.
