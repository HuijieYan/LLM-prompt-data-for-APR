## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a given table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.

## Identified Errors:
1. In the `else` block, the formatting and passing of arguments to the `run_hive_cmd` function seem incorrect.
2. The condition for checking if `stdout` has a value is not handled properly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function occurs due to incorrect string formatting and argument passing in the `else` block. Additionally, handling the condition for checking if `stdout` has a value is not implemented correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Fix the string formatting and argument passing in the `else` block so that the Hive command is correctly constructed.
2. Properly handle the condition for checking if `stdout` has a value, and return `True` if `stdout` is not empty.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The string formatting in the `else` block is fixed to properly construct the Hive command.
- The condition for checking if `stdout` has a value is simplified to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty.
