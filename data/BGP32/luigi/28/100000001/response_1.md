## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

## Analysis, Identification, and Explanation:
1. Analysis: The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug in constructing the Hive query strings for checking if a table or partition exists. The bug occurs in constructing the `show tables like` query for table existence and the `show partitions` query for partition existence.

2. Identification: 
   - The `like` keyword in `show tables like` was causing issues when checking table existence.
   - In the else block, the `show partitions` query was also missing the correct syntax.
   - The logic in the if-else block was unnecessarily complex.

3. Cause of Bug:
   - In the buggy function, the incorrect syntax using `like` in `show tables like` and incorrect formatting in the `show partitions` query led to incorrect results.

4. Strategy for Fixing:
   - Use the correct syntax for checking table existence using `show tables in {database}`.
   - Use the correct syntax for checking partition existence using `show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})`.
   - Simplify the if-else logic for cleaner code.

5. The corrected version of the function includes the fixes mentioned above to resolve the syntax issues and simplify the logic for better readability and correctness.
