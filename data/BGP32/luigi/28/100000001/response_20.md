## Analysis:
The buggy function is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database and, optionally, in a specific partition. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for table existence. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `partition` parameter in the function.

## Potential Errors:
1. The `partition_spec` method seems to be called using `self`, but it is not defined within the function.
2. The formatting of the second `run_hive_cmd` call might result in an erroneous command due to incorrect usage of placeholders.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to execute the Hive command to check if a table exists within a particular partition. Since the `partition_spec` method is not defined or imported properly within the function, it leads to an error. Additionally, the formatting of the command string in the else block appears to be incorrect, leading to a potential error in executing the Hive command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define or import the `partition_spec` method properly in the function to resolve the undefined reference issue.
2. Correct the formatting of the Hive command in the else block to ensure that the command is executed correctly.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec_str))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. The `partition_spec` method is called correctly using `self.partition_spec(partition)`.
2. The Hive command string in the else block is formatted correctly, ensuring the command is executed properly. 
3. The output is converted to a boolean value to simplify the return statement.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the function work as intended.
