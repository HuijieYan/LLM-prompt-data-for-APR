## Analysis of the Buggy Function:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. It has a conditional block to handle cases where a partition is specified.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The way Hive commands are being constructed.
2. Handling of the result obtained from running the Hive commands.
3. Error handling for cases where the Hive command fails or returns empty.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the code may arise due to incorrect construction of the Hive command string or mishandling of the output of the Hive command. This can lead to incorrect detection of table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the constructed Hive command is correct for both cases (with and without the partition).
2. Validate and process the output obtained from running the Hive command to determine table existence accurately.
3. Include proper error handling in case the Hive command execution fails or returns empty results.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Hive command strings are correctly formatted with placeholders to avoid mistakes.
- The output of the Hive command is directly used in the return statement with appropriate handling to determine table existence.
- The function simplifies the output check to return a boolean value directly, improving readability.

By making these changes, the buggy function should now work as expected and accurately determine the existence of a table in a database.
