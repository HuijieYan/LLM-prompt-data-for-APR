## Analysis of the Buggy Function:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. It takes parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`, where `partition` is optional. The function runs Hive commands to check for table existence in either the specified database or a partition within a table.

## Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of the `self.partition_spec(partition)` method within the `run_hive_cmd` call seems incorrect.
2. The formatting of the Hive command in the `else` branch might lead to syntax errors.
3. The condition for returning `True` or `False` based on `stdout` might be simplified.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely originates from an incorrect usage of parameters and formatting issues within the `run_hive_cmd` calls. Additionally, the logic for returning `True` or `False` based on `stdout` can be improved for clarity and simplicity.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `partition_spec` method is correctly utilized within the Hive command string.
2. Correct the formatting of Hive commands in both branches of the conditional statement.
3. Simplify the condition for returning `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- The substitution of parameters in the Hive command strings is simplified.
- The condition for returning `True` or `False` based on `stdout` is concise.
- Potential syntax errors in Hive commands are resolved.
