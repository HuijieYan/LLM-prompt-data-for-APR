## Analyzing the buggy function:

The buggy function is named `table_exists` and takes in parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`. The function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database based on the input parameters. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Incorrect formatting of Hive command strings.
2. Inconsistent use of string formatting methods.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function may arise from the incorrect formatting of the Hive command strings when constructing the query based on the input parameters. The inconsistency in string formatting methods (`format()` and `%`) may lead to issues with constructing the Hive command strings.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent and correct string formatting when constructing the Hive command strings. By using a single string formatting method and validating the generated Hive commands, we can address the bug in the function.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function:
1. The formatting of the Hive command strings is consistent using the `.format()` method for string interpolation.
2. The `partition_cmd` is extracted separately before constructing the Hive command string to ensure clarity and correctness.
3. The return value is simplified to directly convert the `stdout` to a boolean value.

By implementing these corrections, the function should now accurately check for the existence of a table in a Hive database.
