## Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function takes `table`, `database`, and `partition` as input parameters.
3. The bug could potentially be in the construction of the Hive commands for checking table existence.
4. Another potential bug could be in the condition checks for returning True or False.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the code seems to be related to how the Hive command is constructed when checking for table existence.
- In the first `if` block, the Hive command might not be formed correctly.
- In the second `if` block, the condition check for stdout is not reliable for determining the existence of a table.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Correct the construction of the Hive command to accurately check for the existence of tables.
- Use a more reliable method for checking the return status of the Hive command to determine if the table exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show table extended like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        table_list = [line.split()[0] for line in stdout.split('\n')[2:-1]]

        return table in table_list
    else:
        partition_condition = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show table extended like '{1}' partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_condition))
        
        table_list = [line.split()[0] for line in stdout.split('\n')[2:-1]]

        return table in table_list
```
