## Buggy Function Analysis:
The buggy function is a method named `table_exists` defined within a file named `hive.py` in the `luigi/contrib/` directory. The function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function takes three parameters: `table`, `database`, and `partition`. 

## Identified Errors:
1. There is an issue in the second SQL query concatenation where the `partition_spec` method is not correctly called.
2. The logic in the `else` block directly checks the truthiness of the `stdout`, which may not accurately determine if the table exists or not.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug originates from the incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` method in the second SQL query.
2. The flawed logic in the `else` block may lead to incorrect results as it only checks the truthiness of `stdout`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly call the `partition_spec` method with the `partition` parameter in the SQL query concatenation.
2. Implement a more robust check for table existence based on the query output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition {2};'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ''
``` 

In the corrected version, the `partition_spec` method is correctly called in the SQL query concatenation to consider the partition condition. Additionally, the logic for checking table existence now checks if the stripped `stdout` is not empty, providing a more reliable result.
