## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is trying to check if a table exists in a given database with optional partition information. The bug in this function arises due to incorrect formatting of the Hive commands and conditions.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` calls.
2. Incorrect condition checking in the if statements.

## Bug Cause:
1. In the first if-else block, the Hive command inside the `run_hive_cmd` function is missing the correct command to check if a table exists. The condition to check if `table in stdout` might not return the correct result due to incorrect command format.
2. In the second if-else block, the Hive command to show partitions is incorrect due to which the function will not work as expected.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the correct Hive command is used to check if a table exists and correct string formatting is applied.
2. Use the appropriate command to show partitions in the second if-else block.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # This can be simplified

```

In the corrected version:
1. The Hive command to check if a table exists uses 'SHOW TABLES IN' instead of 'SHOW TABLES LIKE'.
2. The Hive command to show partitions is corrected using 'SHOW PARTITIONS' command.
3. The return statement in the second if-else block is simplified by directly converting `stdout` to a boolean value.
