### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It checks whether a table exists in a database with the given table name.

#### Error locations:
1. In the first branch of the if-else statement, the `table in stdout` comparison is sensitive to the case of the table name.
2. In the second branch of the if-else statement, the comparison is made between the `stdout` and a return from the `partition_spec` method which is case-sensitive.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises from the comparison being case-sensitive when checking if a table exists, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. Hive is case-insensitive in table names, so the comparison should be made without considering the case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the relevant parts of the output to lowercase.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the table name and the output comparisons are made in a case-insensitive manner, thus addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
