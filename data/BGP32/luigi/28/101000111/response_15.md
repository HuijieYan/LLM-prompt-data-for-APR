Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. In the if condition for checking table existence without partition.
2. In the else condition for checking table existence with partition.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs due to a case sensitivity issue in comparing the table name in the stdout with the table name provided. Hive is case insensitive, so the table names may be returned in lowercase. However, the buggy function directly compares the table name without considering case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results and test failures.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and make the comparison case insensitive, the table name provided should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout content.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return True if stdout else False
``` 

This corrected version uses lowercase conversions for both the table name provided and the stdout content before comparison, ensuring a case insensitive check for table existence.
