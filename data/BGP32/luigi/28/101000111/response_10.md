## Identified Bug:
The current implementation of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking the existence of tables in Hive. It directly compares the table name with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences, which causes the function to fail when table names have different cases.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the direct comparison of the table name with stdout without converting both to a consistent case (lowercase or uppercase). Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may be returned in lowercase, leading to incorrect comparison results and causing the function to return False even when the table exists.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the stdout are in a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison. By converting both to the same case, we can ensure a correct comparison regardless of the case sensitivity in Hive.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and aligns with the expected input/output values provided for different test cases.
