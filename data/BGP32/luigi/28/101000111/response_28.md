### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function makes a Hive command call to check table existence, with an option for partition-specific checks.
3. The bug identified in the function is related to case sensitivity when checking table names.
4. The bug causes failures when table names in the database are in a different case than the one provided to the function.
5. The proposed fix is to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before checking.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to case sensitivity in comparing the provided table name with the output from the Hive command. If the table names differ in case, the check fails even if the table exists.

### Fix:
Modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

The corrected function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures correct behavior in all the expected test cases.
