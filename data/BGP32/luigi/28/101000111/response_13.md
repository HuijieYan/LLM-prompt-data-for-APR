### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue where it's not handling case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue raised on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the function is that when checking for the existence of a table in Hive, it directly compares the table name with the response from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This can lead to incorrect results if the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the response from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected code:
1. We convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparing them using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.
2. We directly return the boolean result of the comparison in the `else` clause as there's no need for an `if` condition to check the truthiness of `stdout`.

By making these changes, the function now properly handles case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This aligns with the requested fix in the GitHub issue and addresses the bug effectively.
