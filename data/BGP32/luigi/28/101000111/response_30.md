### Analysis
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks whether a table exists in a database by running a Hive command and comparing the result. The bug arises from the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the stdout output. The function needs to be updated to be case insensitive in order to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The main issue here is that the comparison is being done without considering the case of the table names, leading to potential mismatches.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the comparison statement:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
and
```python
if stdout:
    return True
else:
    return False
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the comparison `table in stdout` and `table in stdout.lower()` are case sensitive. This leads to mismatches in table names, causing the function to incorrectly report whether a table exists. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and stdout are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This change will align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the existence of a table. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and satisfy all the expected input/output cases.
