The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the table names returned in the `stdout`. The function fails to recognize table names that have different casing. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the above correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the names returned in the `stdout`, which resolves the GitHub issue of table name case sensitivity. This correction guarantees that the function behaves correctly according to the expected input/output values in all provided test cases.
