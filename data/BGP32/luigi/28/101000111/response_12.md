Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name extracted from the returned `stdout` with the input `table`. The table names returned by the Hive command are converted to lowercase, leading to case sensitivity issues when comparing with the original input table name.

To fix this issue, the comparison should be done using lowercase versions of both the returned table name and the input table name. By doing this, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison and prevent the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Updated version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This updated version fixes the case sensitivity issue by converting both the `stdout` and the input table name to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
