### Analyzing the buggy function

#### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` may fail due to case sensitivity.
2. The comparison `self.partition_spec(partition)` may be causing the issue due to incorrect partition formatting.

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from case sensitivity in the table comparison and potential formatting issues in the partition comparison. The GitHub issue suggests that the comparison should be made case insensitive to resolve this problem.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison operations to be case insensitive and ensure correct partition formatting.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        formatted_partition = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, formatted_partition))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

The corrected function includes adjusting the table comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table and stdout to lowercase. Additionally, the partition formatting has been updated to correctly construct the partition string for comparison. These changes address the reported issues and align with the expectations stated for the function.
