The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the case sensitivity of comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function is currently comparing the exact table name provided with the stdout result, leading to potential mismatches due to case differences.

To address this issue, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case used.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Updated version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function behaves case-insensitively as expected. This modification aligns with the GitHub issue and the expected input/output values specified for each test case.
