## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in a database by running a Hive command.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity, where the function does not handle case differences between the table name provided and the table name returned in `stdout`.
3. The provided GitHub issue suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `table.lower()` in `stdout.lower()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command to ensure case insensitivity.
5. The corrected version of the function should involve modifying the comparison as suggested in the GitHub issue.

## Correction:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we modify the comparison statements to check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the input table name and the returned table name to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function works correctly irrespective of the case of the table names.
