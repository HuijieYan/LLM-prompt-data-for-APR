After analyzing the buggy function and related functions, the bug occurs due to a case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in Hive. The function compares the table name with the output (stdout) from running a Hive command, which may cause a mismatch due to case differences.

To fix this bug, we should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison. This way, the comparison will be case insensitive and prevent false negatives when checking for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name (`table.lower()`) and the output (`stdout.lower()`) to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub. This fix ensures that the table existence check in Hive is more robust and accurate.
