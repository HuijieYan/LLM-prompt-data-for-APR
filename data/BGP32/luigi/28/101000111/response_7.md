The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function compares the table name against the output from Hive, which may not match due to case differences. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name passed as a parameter to the actual table names in the database. The function does a simple string comparison which fails when the case of the characters doesn't match. The bug is reported in the GitHub issue where it suggests making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the table name (parameter) and the table names returned from Hive need to be converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the check is case-insensitive and addresses the issue raised in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function will convert both the table name (parameter) and the table names in the database to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check and resolving the bug.
