The issue in the buggy function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function `table_exists` should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner due to Hive's case insensitivity. This bug leads to incorrect results when checking for table existence if the case of the table name mismatches.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case-insensitive. We can accomplish this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue. The corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output cases provided.
