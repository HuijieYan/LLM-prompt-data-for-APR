Based on the GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity mismatch between the table name passed as an argument and the table names returned in lowercase by Hive. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version:
- We lowercase the `table` before checking if it exists in `stdout`.
- We split `stdout` into a list of strings and lowercase each element before the comparison.

This fix will resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and satisfy the expected input/output values for the test cases.
