The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity of table names while checking for their existence in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output (stdout) from Hive, leading to failures when the names don't match due to case differences.

To resolve this bug, we will convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity. This change will align with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and address the reported problem.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase during comparison, the function will now accurately determine the existence of the table regardless of case differences in the names. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to case insensitivity in `table_exists` function.
