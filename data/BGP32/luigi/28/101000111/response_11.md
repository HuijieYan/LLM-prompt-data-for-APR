The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. To fix this issue and make the function case insensitive, we need to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By updating the condition to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and stdout, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue #896 suggestion to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
