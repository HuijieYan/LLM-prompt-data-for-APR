The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function currently directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, leading to potential failures due to case differences. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
