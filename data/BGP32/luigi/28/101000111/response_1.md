The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is case-sensitive. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, table names in Hive are case-insensitive, causing the buggy function to fail when comparing capitalized table names with lowercase outputs.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking if the table exists in the output. By doing this, we ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between the table name and the output is performed without considering the case, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report. The function now checks if the lowercase table name exists in the lowercase output, making it case-insensitive.
