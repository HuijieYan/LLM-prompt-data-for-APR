### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class aims to check if a specific table exists in a Hive database. The issue mentioned is related to case sensitivity in table names causing test failures. The function utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function and the `self.partition_spec` method.

### Error Location
The bug arises in the conditional statements where the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case sensitive.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is case sensitive. This leads to test failures when the case of table names does not match exactly with the output of the Hive command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and address the case sensitivity issue, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Summary
The bug in the `table_exists` function is fixed by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.
