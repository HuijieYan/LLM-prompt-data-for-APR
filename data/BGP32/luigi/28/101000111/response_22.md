Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison of the table name in `stdout` is case-sensitive, leading to test failures for capitalized table names.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of the table name in `stdout` with the input table name without handling case sensitivity. As Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may be returned in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail for capitalized table names.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the `stdout` are compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and satisfying all the expected input/output values for the function.
