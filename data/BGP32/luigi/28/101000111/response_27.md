### Analyze the buggy function:

The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive queries and retrieve the result, then compares the table name in the result to the expected table name.

- For cases without a partition, the function constructs a Hive query using the `database` and `table` parameters and checks if the table name is present in the returned result.
- For cases with a partition, the function constructs a more complex query using the `database`, `table`, and partition information retrieved from `self.partition_spec`, then validates the existence of the table.

### Identified bug:

The bug arises from case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function performs a direct string comparison of the table name from the Hive query result to the expected table name without considering case sensitivity. This causes issues when the table names have different case variations.

### Bug fix strategy:

To address the case sensitivity issue, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation of the correction:

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and the retrieved table names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- This modification ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the reported issue of table names having different cases.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function will now correctly detect table existence irrespective of the case of table names, satisfying all the expected input/output scenarios and resolving the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
