### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check the existence of a table in a Hive database.
2. The function has conditional logic to handle the case where a partition is provided.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table names with the output from Hive.
4. The bug arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in stdout is case sensitive, leading to test failures.
5. The suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lower case before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the table name comparison is conducted in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name (`table`) and the tables listed in the `stdout` output to lower case before comparing them.
