### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a Hive database by running a command and parsing the output.
3. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence due to differences in case sensitivity between table names passed and returned by Hive.
4. The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name without considering case sensitivity.

### Error Location:
The error is in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the input table name with the output obtained from the Hive command. If the table name has a different case in the Hive output, the function will not accurately determine the existence of the table.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` and `stdout` strings to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure accurate detection of table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the bug reported on GitHub. Now, the function will accurately determine the existence of the table regardless of the table name's case.
