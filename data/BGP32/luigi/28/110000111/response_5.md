### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The function has two main conditions - one for when `partition` is `None` and another for when `partition` is not `None`.
3. The bug arises from the fact that the function directly checks if the table name exists in the output of a Hive command without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures when the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the lack of case insensitivity handling in the comparison between the table name and the output returned by the Hive command. If the table name is in a different case than the one returned by Hive (which is case-insensitive), the function incorrectly returns `False`, even though the table actually exists.

### Strategy for Fixing
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Justification
The corrected function now converts both the `table` and the `stdout` values to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the check for table existence is case-insensitive, fixing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
