### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class.
- This function checks whether a table exists in the given database and optionally in a specific partition.
- The bug originates from case sensitivity issues when checking the table name against the `stdout`.
- The expected input parameters are `table`, `database`, and optionally `partition`.
- The function currently compares the table name directly to the stdout output, leading to case sensitivity problems.

### Error locations:
- The main error is in the comparisons `table in stdout` and `table in stdout.lower()`.
- The function does not account for case sensitivity when matching table names in the `stdout`.

### Cause of the bug:
- When the table name is not in lowercase in the `stdout`, the comparison fails due to case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output is case insensitive.
- Convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for consistency in the comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Conclusion:
- The corrected version of the function ensures that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output is case insensitive, thus fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
