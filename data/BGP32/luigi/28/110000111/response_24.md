### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database with an optional partition.
2. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the function does not compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, leading to test failures.
3. The bug can be traced to the comparison logic that does not consider case-insensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive.
5. The revised function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive queries.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the logical comparison in both branches to use lowercase values for comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

After applying this fix, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the hive queries, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
