### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in Hive but is not handling case sensitivity properly.
2. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where the function fails when checking for tables with different cases (capitalized vs. lower case).
3. The bug is caused by not handling the case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the stdout with the given table name.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the table names in stdout to lower case before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected code:
- Both the `table` and the table names in `stdout` are converted to lower case using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

This fix will resolve the case sensitivity bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class.
