### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence in Hive. However, the issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table names due to Hive's case insensitivity.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug in the function arises from the comparison of the table name, which should be case insensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, without considering case sensitivity.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Updated Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Correction Rationale:
In the corrected version, the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using `lower()` before comparison to make the check case insensitive. This change aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity for table names when checking their existence in Hive.
