To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking if `table` exists in `stdout`. This will address the issue raised in the GitHub discussion about case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version converts both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This change aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case sensitivity issues, as described in the GitHub discussion.
