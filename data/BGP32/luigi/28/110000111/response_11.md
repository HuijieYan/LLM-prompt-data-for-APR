### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database by running a hive command and then verifying the output. The issue arises when the table name is in a different case than what is returned by Hive, causing the comparison to fail.
2. The bug is located in the comparison of the table name in the output from Hive. It does not handle cases where the names are in different letter cases.
3. The bug is caused by a case mismatch when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. The comparison should be case-insensitive to account for variations in table name cases.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing them.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is performed in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
