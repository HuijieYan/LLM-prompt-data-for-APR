### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity in the comparison of table names.
3. The bug occurs when the table name in the database is in a different case (capitalized or lowercase) than the one provided to the function for checking. The function does a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
5. The bug was reported on GitHub, and the suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now satisfies the expected input/output values and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
