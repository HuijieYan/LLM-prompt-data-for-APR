## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a specific database or if a partition exists for a table in a given database.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking table names.
3. The bug arises from the fact that the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, which causes case sensitivity issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

## Revised Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By implementing the suggested fix, the function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence, addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
