### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check whether a table exists in a database with an optional partition.
2. The bug arises when there is a case sensitivity issue between the table name and the output from Hive. The function does not handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to incorrect results.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when checking for tables with names that differ in case, as the comparison is case sensitive. The expected behavior should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive.

### Updated Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the function now performs a case-insensitive check, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
