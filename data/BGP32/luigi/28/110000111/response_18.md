### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. The bug occurs because the function does a case-sensitive check on the table name.
2. The buggy function checks if the table name exists in the output of the command run on Hive. The issue arises when there is a case mismatch between the table name and the output from Hive.
3. The bug manifests itself when a table name provided with mixed cases is compared against the output received from Hive, which is in lowercase. This discrepancy leads to false negatives in table existence checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the Hive output is case-insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function will convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout is not None
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that the check for table existence is now case-insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and aligns with the expected input/output values specified for the function.
