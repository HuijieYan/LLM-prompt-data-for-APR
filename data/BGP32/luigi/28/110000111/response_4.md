### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive.
2. There is a case sensitivity issue where the function compares the table name directly with the content from Hive, leading to failures for tables with different cases.
3. The bug stems from the direct comparison of the table name with the content from Hive without considering case sensitivity. The issue on GitHub suggests checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the content from Hive to lowercase for comparison.
5. The corrected version will involve converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
