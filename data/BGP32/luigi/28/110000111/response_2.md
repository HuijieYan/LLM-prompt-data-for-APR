### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function**: The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug arises from case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the stdout.
   
2. **Buggy class**: The class `HiveCommandClient` utilizes Hive invocations to retrieve information.
   
3. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - The function should check if a specific table exists in a given database.
   - For cases with partitions, it needs to handle the partition specifics.

4. **GitHub Issue**:
   The issue describes the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive as Hive is case insensitive while returning table names.

### Bug Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name with the stdout is case sensitive, leading to failing tests when table names are different cases.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual table names.

### Bug Cause:
The `table_exists` function directly checks for an exact match between the provided table name and the table names in the stdout returned by Hive. Since Hive is case insensitive, this direct comparison fails when the cases do not match, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the input table name and the table names obtained from Hive stdout. By converting both names to lowercase, we can achieve a consistent comparison method regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the input `table` name and the table names obtained from Hive to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
