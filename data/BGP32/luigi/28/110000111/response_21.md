### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a specified database with an optional partition.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the provided table name without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug arises from comparing the table name directly with `stdout` without considering case differences. This leads to failures when the table name casing does not match exactly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make the function case insensitive.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now performs a case-insensitive check. This solution addresses the bug causing incorrect outcomes due to case sensitivity issues.
