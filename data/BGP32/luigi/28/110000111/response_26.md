### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. The bug arises when the function compares the table name from `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
2. The bug occurs when checking for table existence with case-sensitive table names.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout`, which treats the comparison as case-sensitive. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, Hive is case insensitive, so the comparison should be made in a case-insensitive manner.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and `stdout` to be case-insensitive by converting both to lower case before comparison.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lower case before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database.
