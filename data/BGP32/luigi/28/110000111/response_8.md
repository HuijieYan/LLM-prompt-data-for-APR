### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to properly handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. This leads to incorrect results when comparing table names against the output from Hive queries, causing test failures and issues accessing tables defined with different casing.

### Identified Error Location:
1. The function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output from Hive queries.
2. The function does not handle different casing scenarios for table names during comparison, leading to inconsistencies in table existence checks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function not considering case sensitivity when checking for table existence. It directly compares the provided table name without converting it to a consistent case for comparison with the output from Hive queries.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the output from Hive queries to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison. This approach will ensure that case differences do not affect the table existence checks.

### Correction of the Buggy Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output from Hive queries are converted to lowercase before comparison. This approach ensures that case sensitivity issues are avoided, and table existence checks are performed reliably.

By making this adjustment, the function now aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
