### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**: The function `table_exists()` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class which is used for interacting with Hive invocations to find information.
   
2. **Expected Input/Output Values**:
   - Input Parameters: `table`, `database`, `partition`
   - Expected Output: `stdout` containing the result of the Hive command, which is checked for table existence
   
3. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The issue indicates that table names are case-insensitive in Hive, leading to failures if table names are not in lower case.
   
### Identified Bug:
The bug is in the comparison of the table name contained in `stdout` with the input table name. Since Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, direct comparison may fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both `table` and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive. This aligns with the suggestions provided in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

The corrected version modifies the condition to check for the lowercase version of the input table name in the lowercase `stdout`. This change enables a case-insensitive comparison in line with the suggestion from the GitHub issue.
