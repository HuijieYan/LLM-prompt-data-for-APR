### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the specified database. However, there is a bug where the comparison is case-sensitive which causes issues when the table name is in a different case than expected.
2. The bug occurs when checking `table in stdout` without converting either `table` or `stdout` to a consistent case.
3. The bug is highlighted in the GitHub issue where it's mentioned that the function should be case-insensitive. This is because Hive is case-insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, making the check case-insensitive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.
2. Update the function to perform a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This corrected version of the function addresses the bug described and aligns with the expected input/output values and the resolution proposed in the GitHub issue.
