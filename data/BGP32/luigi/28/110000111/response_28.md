### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for table existence in Hive by running queries and analyzing the output.
2. The potential error lies in the comparison of the table name with the output, especially considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug arises when the table names provided have different cases (uppercase/lowercase) compared to the actual Hive table names, leading to failures in table existence checks due to case mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the Hive table name is case insensitive.
5. We can modify the comparison to convert both names to lowercase before comparison to resolve the case sensitivity issue.

### Correction:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the one fetched from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This modification aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue, addressing the case sensitivity problem.
