### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database.
2. The function runs a `hive` command to find information about the table.
3. The bug arises in case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `hive` command.
4. The suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the `hive` command. If the table name is in a different case than the output, the comparison will fail.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly identify the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
