### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
- The bug seems to be in the if-else block where the condition to check the existence of a table in a database is not working as expected.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if stdout:` may not correctly capture the existence of a table in the database.
2. The return statements may not be returning the correct values based on the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if stdout:` in the else block does not properly handle the check for table existence with a partition. The function assumes that any non-empty string indicates table existence, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need a more robust check to accurately determine table existence with or without partitions. We can modify the condition to check for specific patterns in the output to confirm the existence of a table. Additionally, we should ensure that the function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            # Check for specific patterns in stdout to confirm table existence with partition
            return any(partition_key in stdout for partition_key in partition.keys())
```

### Result:
By incorporating the suggested changes, the corrected function should now accurately check for the existence of a table with or without a partition, fixing the bug identified in the original implementation.
