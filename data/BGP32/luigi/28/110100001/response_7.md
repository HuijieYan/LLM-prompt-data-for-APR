### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run commands and check for the existence of a table with optional partition.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking if the table exists.
- The test function `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and testing the behavior of the `table_exists` function.
- The buggy function fails the test cases due to incorrect handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic where it checks if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function assumes that if the table name is present in the output, then the table exists, which is incorrect.
- Specifically, in the else block of the function, when checking for partitioned tables, the logic only checks if there is any output (`stdout`) from the command execution and not whether the specific partition exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `table_exists` function to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- Check if the table exists in the case of no partition and verify if the specific partition exists when partition information is provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.strip().split('\n')
``` 

### Updated Test Function:
Include the corrected version of the function in the `HiveCommandClient` class and run the test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
