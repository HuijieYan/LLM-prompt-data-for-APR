## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is trying to determine if a table exists in a Hive database by running specific Hive commands.
- The function checks if a partition is specified and then runs different commands accordingly.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output from the Hive commands and determines if the table exists or not.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The bug could be occurring in the condition where the function checks if `stdout` is a truthy value to decide if the table exists or not.
- The bug could also be related to how the Hive command is constructed when checking for partitions.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug seems to be caused by not properly handling the output from the Hive commands in the `table_exists` function. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not accurately determine if the table exists based on the output of the Hive command.
- The second condition where the function checks for partitions may also have issues in constructing the Hive command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the function to properly parse the output of the Hive command to accurately determine if the table exists or not.
- Check the construction of the Hive command when checking for partitions to ensure it is correctly formed.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

By incorporating the correct parsing logic for the output of the Hive commands and adjusting the condition to check for table existence, the bug in the `table_exists` function should be fixed.
