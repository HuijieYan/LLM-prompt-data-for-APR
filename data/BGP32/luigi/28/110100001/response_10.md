## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking whether a given table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine the existence of a table.
3. The bug occurs when checking for the table existence with a specific partition. The partition information is not being processed correctly, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the partition information is correctly included in the Hive command when checking for a table with a partition.

## Updated Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # The corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2};""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

After making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle table existence checks with partitions as well.

## Fixed Test Function:
No changes are needed in the test function as the function uses a mock instance to test the behavior of the corrected `table_exists` function.
