### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
- It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine the existence of the table.
- The buggy function fails the test cases provided because it does not handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when the table exists. It checks for the presence of the table name in the output without considering the actual format of the output.
- In the case where the table exists, the output from `run_hive_cmd` contains the table name followed by a newline character, which the current implementation of the function does not account for.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- We should check if the table name is present in the output, accounting for the possibility of the table name being followed by a newline character.
- We can also refactor the function to make it more readable and handle the partition case more effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1};".format(database, table))
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            return any(partition_spec in line for line in stdout.split("\n"))
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function now splits the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters and checks for the table name or partition specs accordingly. This should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
