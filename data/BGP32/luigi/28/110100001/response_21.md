### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a given database with optional partition. The buggy function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run the Hive command which retrieves information about tables or partitions.

### Error Location:
1. The conditional statement `return stdout and table in stdout` will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty and `table` is in `stdout`.
2. The potential error is in the use of the `and` operator, which may not evaluate correctly for this condition.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is checking for table existence by performing a logical `and` operation between the result of the `run_hive_cmd` and the presence of the table in the result. If the result contains the table name within another string, the condition may evaluate incorrectly.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is a whole word in the list of tables retrieved, rather than just a part of it. We can split the `stdout` by newline characters and check each entry to ensure that the table name is an exact match.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking each entry for an exact match, we can ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of the table in the database. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
