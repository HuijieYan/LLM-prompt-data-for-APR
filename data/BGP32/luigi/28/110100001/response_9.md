## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The function has two branches, one for checking without a partition and the other for checking with a partition.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The failing test checks for table existence without a partition first and then with a partition, and the function fails in both cases.
5. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the function correctly parses and validates the stdout from `run_hive_cmd`.

## Bug:
The bug is in how the function `table_exists` processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not correctly handle the case where the stdout contains the table name.

## Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly process the stdout by splitting it and checking for the table name. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return True if stdout else False
```

With this correction, the function now correctly splits the stdout and checks if the table name exists in the output.

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
