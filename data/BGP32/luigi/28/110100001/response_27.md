### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the specified database. The bug occurs in the `if` condition where it checks if the `stdout` is not empty and the table is in `stdout`, and in the else condition where it checks if `stdout` is not empty. The logic for checking the existence of the table is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to always return `True` when a partition is provided, and there is data in `stdout`. This behavior is incorrect as it does not accurately check if the table exists based on the provided conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, the logic for checking the existence of the table needs to be revised. We need to properly handle cases where a partition is provided and ensure that the check is done correctly to return `True` only if the table exists according to the specified conditions.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout != ""
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue with incorrect table existence checking should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test.
