### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic inside the function where it checks for the presence of the table in the stdout output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug likely causes the function to always return `True` even if the table does not exist, leading to failing test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly checks the stdout output to determine if the table exists or not.


### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return "OK" in stdout
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to return `"OK" in stdout` when checking for partitions, it ensures that the function checks if "OK" exists in the stdout output, which indicates the table/partition exists. This modification will address the bug and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test cases.
