The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is incorrectly checking the presence of a table in the output obtained from running a Hive command. The issue lies in the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable. 

In the first case where `partition` is None, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`, but it fails to strip the whitespace from the `stdout`, leading to a false negative in the test case.

In the second case where `partition` is provided, the function generates a partition-specific command but does not actually check for the existence of the table in the output as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the output from the Hive command by stripping whitespace and checking the presence of the table in the output correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() and table in stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly strips whitespace from the `stdout` and checks the presence of the table as expected.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases for `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists`.
