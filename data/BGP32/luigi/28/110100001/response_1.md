### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
- The function checks if a table exists in a database using `hive` invocations.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug seems to be in the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function.
- The function currently returns `True` if there is any output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, even if the table name is not found in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the function only returns `True` if the table name is explicitly found in the output.
- We should also handle cases where the table name might have mixed case or additional whitespace.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking if the `table` exists in those lines, we ensure that the function only returns `True` if the table name is found in the output. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
