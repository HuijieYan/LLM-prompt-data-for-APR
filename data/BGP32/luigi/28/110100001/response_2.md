### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks the output to determine if the table exists.
2. The bug seems to be in the handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function to return specific outputs and checks if the `table_exists` function behaves correctly. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results for certain inputs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `stdout` variable based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to accurately determine if the table exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `table_exists` function to incorrectly determine whether a table exists or not based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not process the output correctly when checking for the table's existence.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. We can split the `stdout` based on newlines and check if the table name is present in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
```

By splitting the `stdout` based on newlines and checking if the table name is present in the output, the corrected version ensures accurate detection of whether the table exists or not.
