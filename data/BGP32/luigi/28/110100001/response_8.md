## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the logic of checking if a table exists in the correct way. Specifically, the condition to check if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is incorrect. The function should return `True` if the table is found in the output, but the existing implementation is inaccurate.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `table_exists` function. The function is returning the result of the condition `stdout and table in stdout`, which might not always evaluate to the correct outcome. This can cause the test cases to fail when they are asserting the existence of a table.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately check if the table exists in the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`. It should return `True` if the table is found and `False` if not.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1};".format(database, table))
        return table in stdout

```

By correcting the condition to simply check if the table is in the stdout output, the function should now accurately determine the existence of a table. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
