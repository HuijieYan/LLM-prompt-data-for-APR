The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the way it checks for the existence of a table in the database. The bug is related to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being processed in the `table_exists` function.

When the `run_hive_cmd` function returns a non-empty string in the first case (no partition), the function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` by simply using `table in stdout`. However, this logic is incorrect because the `table` might be a substring of another table name present in the `stdout`.

In the second case (when there is a partition), the function checks for the existence of a table with a specific partition. However, this logic is flawed as it does not consider the entire partition spec and only checks for the presence of the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of both cases to accurately check for the existence of the table in the database.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split("\n")
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});')
            partitions = stdout.split("\n")
            return bool(partitions)
```

In the corrected version:
- In the case where there is no partition, we split the `stdout` by newline character and then check if the `table` exists in the list of tables.
- In the case where there is a partition, we split the `stdout` by newline character and then check if any partitions exist for the specific table and partition spec.

This corrected version should now properly handle checking for the existence of tables in the database and address the bug identified in the failing test.
