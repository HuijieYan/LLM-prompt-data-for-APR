The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it is not correctly checking if a table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug is in the conditional statements where it returns `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout` variable.

The issue arises in the `if stdout:` check, where it only checks if `stdout` exists and not if the table name is actually present in the output. The correct logic should be to split the `stdout` by newline and then check if the table name is in the list of tables.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline and then checks if the `table` is in the list. It simplifies the return statements based on the presence of `stdout` in the partitioned case.

By using this corrected function, the failing test cases should pass as the function now correctly checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
