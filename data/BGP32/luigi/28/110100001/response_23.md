### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
3. The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table with a specified partition. The condition to check for the existence of a partition is incorrect.
4. The bug causes the function to always return False when checking for a partitioned table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of a partitioned table needs to be corrected to properly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function returns `False` only when there is no output indicating the presence of the table with the specified partition.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            # Handling the case when table exists but partition does not
            if partition and ("partition not found" in stdout or "No partition" in stdout):
                return False
            return bool(stdout)
```

By correcting the condition to handle the cases where the table exists but the partition does not, we ensure that the function returns the correct result when checking for the existence of a partitioned table.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases related to table existence checks, including partitioned tables.
