## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function has two branches - one for handling partitions and one for regular table existence checks.
3. The bug occurs in the else branch where it is checking for partitions.
4. The bug lies in the formatting of the query in the `run_hive_cmd` call, which is not correctly constructing the query for checking partitions.
5. The current logic in the buggy function returns `True` if the command runs successfully but always returns `False` otherwise when it should only return `False` if the table or partition does not exist.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the query construction in the `run_hive_cmd` call to correctly check for partitions.
2. Modify the logic to return `False` only if the command fails or the table/partition does not exist.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Fix the buggy function table_exists
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return "No Partitions" not in stdout
```

Now, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function correctly constructs the query for checking partitions and returns `False` only if the table/partition does not exist. This version should pass the failing test.
