The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking if a table exists in the specified database with optional partition. The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the Hive command invocations in the function.

The bug can be identified in the `table_exists` function where the `stdout` variable is assigned incorrectly, leading to incorrect checks for table existence and partition.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly, and the stdout value is processed accurately to determine the existence of the table and partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_values = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_values))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the Hive command invocations are correctly formatted, ensuring that the table and partition checks are performed accurately. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected, passing the provided failing test cases.
