The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class contains an issue with the conditional logic for checking if a table exists in the specified database. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that the function checks if the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function is not empty to determine if the table exists. However, the function may return other information along with the table name, causing the check to be inaccurate.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly check if the table name is present in the response, regardless of any additional information. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.splitlines()
        return any(table == t.strip() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.splitlines()
        return any(partition == p.strip() for p in partitions)
```

This corrected version splits the response from `run_hive_cmd` into lines and checks if the specified table or partition exists in those lines. This approach ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of the table in the database.

After applying this fix and running the failing test, the corrected `table_exists` function should pass all the test cases successfully.
