The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable. In the first part of the function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not work as intended if the `stdout` string is not exactly equal to the table name. In the second part, the check `if stdout` might not accurately detect the existence of the table/partition due to how the Hive command output is parsed.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to directly check if the table/partition name is present in the `stdout` output, rather than relying on specific string comparisons. Additionally, we can handle any case sensitivity issues if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        return partition_str in stdout.split('\n')
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking if the table/partition name is in the resulting list, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table/partition. This fix should satisfy all the expected input/output values provided.
