The bug in the provided function stems from the fact that the `table` variable in the first case is expected to be case-sensitive, while the comparison being made between `table` and `stdout` is case-insensitive. This means that the function may return incorrect results when checking for table existence.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to be case-sensitive by using the `lower()` function on both `table` and `stdout`. Additionally, we can remove unnecessary `else` statements to simplify the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures the function compares table names in a case-sensitive manner, addressing the bug described above.
