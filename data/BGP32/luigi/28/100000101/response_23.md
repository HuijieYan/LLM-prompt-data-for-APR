### Explanation:
The buggy function has an issue in the condition checks for whether the table exists or not. In the first part, it checks if the table exists by searching for the table name in the output string. This can lead to false positives if the table name is present in other parts of the output.

In the second part, when checking for the existence of partitions, the condition check is incorrect. It only checks if the `stdout` is present, which might not be a correct indicator of whether the partitions exist or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. For checking the existence of the table, a more robust approach would be to split the `stdout` into lines and check if the table name exists in any of the lines independently.
2. When checking for the existence of partitions, the function should look specifically for the partition key-value pairs to ensure the correct presence of partitions.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected function file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return all(elem in stdout for elem in self.partition_spec(partition).split(','))

``` 

By using the `any()` function in the first part to iterate over the lines of `stdout` and checking if the table name matches exactly, we can accurately determine the existence of the table.

In the second part, using the `all()` function, we check if all the key-value pairs of the partition specification are present in the output, providing a more accurate confirmation of partition existence.
