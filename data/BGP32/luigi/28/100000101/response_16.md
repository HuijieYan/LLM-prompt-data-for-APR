The bug in the given function lies in the condition check for the presence of the table or partition in the stdout. The current implementation checks if the stdout variable is non-empty but doesn't accurately verify if the table or partition actually exists in the stdout.

To fix this bug, we need to parse the stdout output to check if the table/partition exists in it. Additionally, we need to normalize the case of the table name before comparing it to the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.lower() != 'OK'
```

By normalizing the case and including proper checks for the presence of the table/partition in the output, the corrected function should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the test cases provided.
