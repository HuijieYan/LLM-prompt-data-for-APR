The bug in the provided function lies in the condition checking for the existence of a table. The bug is caused by an incorrect check on the `stdout` variable. The function assumes that if `stdout` is not empty, the table exists, which might not be correct. 

To fix this bug, we should explicitly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable, considering that the output might contain additional information.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return table in stdout  # check if the table name is present in the stdout
        else:
            return False
```

By explicitly checking if the table name appears in the `stdout` variable, we ensure more accuracy in determining the existence of the table. This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values listed in the cases provided.
