## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` has two main branches based on whether a `partition` is provided or not. In the first branch (when `partition is None`), the function runs a Hive command to check if a table exists in a particular database. In the second branch (when `partition is not None`), the function runs a Hive command to check if a partition exists for a specific table in a database.

There seem to be issues with how the function handles the return values from the `run_hive_cmd` function and how it checks for existence. The function currently returns `stdout and table in stdout`, but the expected behavior should be more explicit in handling the output.

## Bug
The bug occurs in how the function does not accurately handle the output from the Hive commands. It simply checks if `stdout` exists or not and does not perform a robust check to confirm if the table or partition actually exists in the output.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table or partition exists in the output. We should handle cases where the table or partition name might be included in unwanted results.

## Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
        
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.strip()
        
        return any(partition_spec in partitions for partition_spec in self.partition_spec(partition))
```
