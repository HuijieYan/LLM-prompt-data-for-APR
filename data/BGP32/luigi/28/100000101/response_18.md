### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` currently has issues with the `run_hive_cmd` and the comparison of the output to determine if a table exists. The function is not handling the stdout output correctly, which leads to incorrect decisions about table existence.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is not processing the output properly and, as a result, the comparison to determine table existence is failing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is called correctly and the stdout output is processed accurately to determine table existence. We should also handle potential edge cases where the table name might be present in the output but in a different form (e.g., case sensitivity).

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the function to handle case sensitivity by converting both the table names and the names in stdout to lowercase, we can ensure a more reliable comparison for table existence. The function now returns True if the table is found in the stdout, indicating that the table exists, and False otherwise.
