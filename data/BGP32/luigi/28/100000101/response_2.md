The bug in the provided function is related to the comparison of the `table` variable with the output `stdout`. The function is checking if the `table` is in the `stdout` list, which can lead to incorrect results due to case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` and elements in `stdout` is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the `table` and elements in `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function ensures that the comparison between the `table` and elements in `stdout` is case-insensitive, therefore satisfying all the expected input/output values in the provided test cases.
