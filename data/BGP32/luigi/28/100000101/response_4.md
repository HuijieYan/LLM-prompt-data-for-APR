The buggy function has an issue with the condition checking the existence of a table in a database. In the first if-else block, the function uses the `show tables` Hive command to check for table existence, while in the second block, it uses `show partitions`. The bug is likely related to the different outputs of these two commands and how the function handles those outputs.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to standardize the output checking process for both cases. We can check for the presence of the table name in the output of the commands and return `True` if found, and `False` otherwise.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
``` 

The corrected function now checks if the table name is present in the output from both `show tables` and `show partitions` commands before returning the result as `True` or `False`.

This revised implementation should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
