The bug in the provided function is that the condition to check if `stdout` contains the table name is not correctly implemented. The function is currently returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which will not work as intended. Additionally, there is a bug in the formatting of the Hive command query when `partition` is not None.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the condition to check if the table exists in the `stdout` properly.
2. Fix the formatting of the Hive command query when `partition` is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # check if stdout is not empty

```

The corrected version rectifies the two issues outlined above to ensure that the function behaves correctly according to the expected input/output values provided.
