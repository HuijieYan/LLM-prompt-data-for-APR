The bug in the provided function lies in the condition used to check the existence of a table based on the stdout variable. The function returns the output of the command and checks if the table is in the output, but it fails to consider the case where the table name is part of another table name resulting in a false positive.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check for an exact match of the table name in the output instead of just checking for its presence. We can also simplify the logic within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

This corrected version ensures that the function only returns True if the exact table name is found in the output and otherwise returns False as expected.
