The bug in the provided function is related to the comparison of the 'table' variable in the 'stdout'. The function is not handling the case where the table names might differ based on the case sensitivity. In the buggy function, the condition `table in stdout` does not consider case sensitivity, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can convert both the 'table' and 'stdout' to lowercase before comparing them. This way, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both 'table' and 'stdout' to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the table exists in the database irrespective of the case. This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values outlined for the failing test cases.
