The buggy function is attempting to check if a table exists in a database using Hive queries. There are two main potential error locations in the function:

1. In the `table_exists` function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is problematic because if `stdout` is an empty string (`''`), the condition will evaluate to `False`, incorrectly indicating that the table does not exist.

2. In the `else` part of the function, the condition `if stdout` will return `True` even if the stdout contains columns of partitions, not the actual table existence status.

To fix the bugs, we need to modify the conditions to properly handle the output of the Hive queries and check for the existence of the table correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version modifies the return conditions to properly check for the existence of the table in the database based on the stdout output from the Hive queries. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces from the stdout to ensure accurate comparison.
