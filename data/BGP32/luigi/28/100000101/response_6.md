Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, the bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name with the output received from the Hive commands. The bug occurs because the table name is case-sensitive, but the comparison in the buggy function does not account for case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the function case-insensitive. This approach aligns with the expected input/output values provided in the cases.
