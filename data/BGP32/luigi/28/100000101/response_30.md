Looking at the buggy function, the potential error lies in the conditional checks for the presence of `stdout` value. The function is not handling the case where `stdout` might contain unwanted characters like newline characters `\n`, thus impacting the accurate check if the table exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks and ensure that `table` is checked within the trimmed `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() and table in [t.strip() for t in stdout.split('\n')]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By adding the `.strip()` method to both `stdout` and the table names being checked against it, we ensure that any leading or trailing whitespaces, including newline characters, are removed before the comparison. This modification aligns the function with the expected behavior in all provided test cases.
