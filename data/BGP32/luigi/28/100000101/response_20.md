### Analysis
The buggy function currently has issues with the formatting of the Hive commands it executes for checking table existence. The primary problem lies in the way the commands are being constructed and executed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first `if` block (when `partition is None`), the Hive command being executed is `use {database}; show tables like "{table}";`. The issue here is that the `show tables` command in Hive outputs a list of tables in lowercase, but the function is checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. Therefore, it may return incorrect results when the input table name has a different case.

2. In the `else` block (when `partition` is not None), the Hive command being executed is `use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)`. The problem here is with the string formatting for the command. The `%s` placeholders should be used directly in the command string, but currently, the function is trying to format the command using the `%` operator later on, causing syntax errors in the Hive query execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the table names are checked in a case-insensitive manner by converting them to lowercase before comparison.
2. Fix the string formatting in the `else` block to correctly insert the database name, table name, and partition specification in the Hive command.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = [t.lower() for t in stdout.strip().split()]
        return table.lower() in tables
    else:
        formatted_partition = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, formatted_partition))
        return True if stdout else False
``` 

By converting the table names to lowercase when checking for their existence and fixing the string formatting to correctly insert variables in the Hive commands, the corrected function aligns with the expected input/output values in all given test cases.
