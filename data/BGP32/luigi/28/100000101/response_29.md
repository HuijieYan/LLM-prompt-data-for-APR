The bug in the given function lies in how the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to check if a table or partition exists in the database. The issue is that the function does not handle the case where the output of `run_hive_cmd` might not directly match the table or partition name being checked.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` to check if the table or partition exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});')

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We have used the `strip()` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the `stdout` before comparing it with the table name.
- We have modified the return statement in the first case to directly compare `stdout.strip()` with the table name.
- In the second case, we return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, meaning that there are partitions matching the partition specification.

This corrected version should now handle the cases provided and return the expected values as specified.
