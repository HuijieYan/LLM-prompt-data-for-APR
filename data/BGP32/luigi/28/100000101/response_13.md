The buggy function has a logical error in the condition checking for the existence of a table. In the first `if` block, the function checks whether the `table` is in the `stdout` result of the `show tables` command. However, in the second `else` block, the function checks only if the `stdout` result exists and does not actually check if the `partition` exists, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of the table in both cases, with or without partitions. We will modify the function to return `True` if the `table` is in the `stdout` result, and `False` otherwise in both cases.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
```

This corrected version will now correctly check for the existence of the table in both scenarios, with or without partitions, ensuring consistency in the function's behavior across different cases.
