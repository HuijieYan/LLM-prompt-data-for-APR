The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison between the `table` and the output `stdout`. The function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` output after running the hive command. However, in some cases, the comparison does not handle the case sensitivity properly, which causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, so it should pass all the test cases provided.
