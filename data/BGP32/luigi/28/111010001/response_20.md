1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. It does this by running a Hive command based on whether a partition is provided or not. The `run_hive_cmd` function is used to execute the Hive command.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the condition checking for the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly processing the output of the Hive command. The function is returning the boolean result of containing the table name in the output, which may not always be accurate due to how the output is structured.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function processes the stdout from the Hive command to accurately determine if the table exists or not.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, partition))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- When `partition` is `None`, it runs a Hive command to show tables in the specified database, and the function checks if the table exists in the output.
- When `partition` is not `None`, it runs a Hive command with a specific partition and checks if the table exists in the output.

This corrected version should accurately determine if the table exists based on the Hive command output, fixing the bug reported in the failing tests.
