### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the table existence check is incorrect.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the output of `run_hive_cmd` with the table name.
4. The bug is likely occurring due to improper parsing of the stdout output from `run_hive_cmd`.
5. The bug can be fixed by modifying the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout and len(stdout.split("\n")) > 1:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Why this fix works:
The corrected version now checks if the stdout contains more than one line after splitting it by newline characters. If the table exists, the stdout should contain more than one line (the table name being part of the output) which indicates that the table exists. This fix corrects the comparison logic and should make the function work as intended.
