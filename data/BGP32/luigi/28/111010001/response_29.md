### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the class `HiveCommandClient` in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. It uses another function `run_hive_cmd` from the same file to execute Hive commands.
2. The error occurs when trying to check if a table exists. The function should return True if the table is found in the output of the Hive command execution, and False otherwise.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing because even though the table exists in the output, the function is returning False instead of True.
4. The bug is likely in how the function is checking the existence of the table in the output of the Hive command. It seems that the function is not correctly parsing the output.
5. The bug can be fixed by properly checking if the table name exists in the stdout obtained from the Hive command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the output from the Hive command and verify if the table name exists in it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # The following line properly checks if the table name exists in the stdout
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} partition ({3});".format(database, database, table, partition_output))
            # The following line properly checks if output is not empty
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we have made adjustments to correctly parse the stdout from the Hive command, check if the table name exists in the output, and also ensure that the function returns True when there is non-empty stdout in the case of a partitioned table.
