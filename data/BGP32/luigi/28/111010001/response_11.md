1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is attempting to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. It utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function defined outside the class to execute Hive commands and check the stdout for table existence. The issue is related to the condition for checking table existence and the handling of stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

2. The bug is specifically in the condition where the function checks if the table exists based on the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

3. The bug occurs because the condition `stdout and table in stdout` will evaluate to `True` even if `table` is not found in `stdout` (e.g., when `stdout` is an empty string). This leads to incorrect results being returned by the function when determining if a table exists.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout`. We should only return `True` if the table name is found in the stdout output.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.splitlines() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we use `splitlines()` to extract lines from the `stdout` and then check if the `table` exists in those lines. This way, we ensure that we only return `True` if the table name is found in the list of tables returned by `show tables` command.
