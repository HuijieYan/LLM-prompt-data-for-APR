### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking for the existence of a table.
- The function calls `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
- There are two branches in the function based on whether a partition is specified or not.
- The first branch checks for the existence of a table by running a Hive command, but the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is causing issues.
- The second branch fetches the partition details and tries to validate if the table exists, but this logic is also incorrect.

### Bug:
The bug in the code is that the function is not correctly checking the output of the Hive commands to determine the existence of a table. The condition checks are faulty in both branches.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the condition to check if the output of the Hive command contains the table name in a more robust way.
- Make sure to handle both cases where the Hive command output contains the table name, and where it doesn't.
- Handle the check for case insensitivity as mentioned in the test case to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}'.format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return stdout.lower() == partition_spec.lower()
```

In the corrected version:
- Added `in` operator to check if the table name is present in the output of the Hive command or not, ignoring case sensitivity.
- Corrected the command construction for fetching partition details and comparing it with the actual partition spec.
- Used `.lower()` to make comparisons case insensitive.
- Removed unnecessary checks and simplified the logic for table existence validation.
