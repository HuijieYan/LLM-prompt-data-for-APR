### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The function is using an `if-else` block to handle the case when the partition is not `None`.
3. The bug in the function is leading to incorrect results in the test cases. The error messages indicate that the function is returning an incorrect result when checking if a table exists.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect formatting of the Hive command strings when constructing them based on input parameters.
  
### Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect formatting of the Hive command strings used to check for the existence of tables. This leads to incorrect results when checking if a table exists, causing the test cases to fail.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command strings are constructed correctly with the provided input parameters. Specifically, we need to format the strings correctly, especially when dealing with partitions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partitions = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        cmd = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partitions)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)
        return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, we construct the Hive command string by iterating over the key-value pairs in the `partition` dictionary to format the partition specification correctly. This ensures that the Hive commands are properly formatted and executed, fixing the bug in the `table_exists` function.
