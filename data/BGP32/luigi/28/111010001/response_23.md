1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The issue seems to be related to the conditions checking for the existence of a table and returning the correct value based on the output of the Hive command.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are the conditional statements that check if the table exists in the Hive database and return the corresponding boolean value.

3. The bug is likely caused by the return value not being properly processed from the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not, but the comparison logic is incorrect.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statements to properly check if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and return the boolean value accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        # Edited the condition to properly check for output containing the partition
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Check if the table exists based on the output
        return table in stdout
```

With this corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it should now correctly return `True` if the table exists in the Hive database and `False` otherwise, passing the failing tests.
