### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The function is checking whether a table exists in the specified database. It does this by running a Hive command and checking if the table name appears in the output.
3. The bug is likely in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command.
4. The failing test asserts that the function should return `True` when the table exists but it is returning `False` instead.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the output contains the table name, but it doesn't handle the cases where the table name appears within another word or string in the output. For example, if the output contains `mytable_custom`, the function would incorrectly detect it as the existence of `mytable`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to ensure that we are correctly matching the table name in the output. We should also consider handling case insensitivity for table names to make the function more robust.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())

``` 

By splitting the stdout into a list of words and comparing each word individually with the table name, we ensure a more accurate check for table existence. Additionally, converting both words to lowercase before comparison makes the check case-insensitive.
