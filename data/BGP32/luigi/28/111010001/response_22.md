### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is defined in the class `HiveCommandClient` and it calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. If a partition is provided, it also includes the partition information in the Hive command.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the boolean return values are not as expected. In the first case, the table actually exists but the function returns `False`, causing an assertion error.
4. The bug seems to be related to the way the function processes the output of the Hive command and checks for the existence of the table.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure that the function correctly parses the output of the Hive command and returns the correct boolean value based on whether the table exists or not.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

### Explanation:
The bug in the original function was due to the incorrect parsing of the Hive command output. By using formatted strings in the Pythonic way, the Hive command can be properly constructed to include partition information. The corrected version ensures that the function returns the correct boolean value based on whether the table exists or not, as expected by the test cases.
