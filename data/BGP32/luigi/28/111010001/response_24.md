### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug occurs when the function checks whether a table exists in the database by running a Hive command. There are issues related to handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The error occurs because the function is not checking the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly. It should return `True` if the table exists in the database based on the output and `False` otherwise. The failing tests are expecting the correct behavior based on the output of the `run_command` mock.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine whether the table exists or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition for checking if the table exists based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to correctly identify whether the table exists in the database.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

By splitting the output of `stdout` and checking if the `table` is in the list of tables returned, we can accurately determine if the table exists in the database. Additionally, for the case where a partition is specified, we can simply check if the `stdout` is not an empty string to determine if the table exists.

After applying these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing tests.
