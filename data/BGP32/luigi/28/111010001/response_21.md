### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class tries to determine if a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The error message indicates that for test cases where the table name is provided in different cases (e.g., "mytable" and "MyTable"), the function is returning a wrong result.
4. The bug occurs because the function is not case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the output of the Hive command.
5. To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function to use a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table name exists in the output of the Hive command.
2. By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.
3. Update the `table_exists` function to accommodate this change.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the case-insensitive comparison should now work correctly, ensuring that the function returns the expected results for tables with names in different cases.
