### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` which is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. The `table_exists` function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The buggy function has a bug in the `if` condition where it checks if the table exists based on the stdout of the Hive command. The bug might be related to how the output of the Hive command is checked.
4. The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the function is not correctly identifying the presence of the table in the stdout of the Hive command.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves checking the stdout of the Hive command accurately to determine if the table exists.

### Correction:
Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout

        else:
            partition_str = ','.join(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, partition_str))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The correction includes joining the partition keys into a string in case there are multiple partitions, and then checking for the presence of the table in the stdout.

After this correction, the function should accurately determine whether the table exists based on the Hive command output.
