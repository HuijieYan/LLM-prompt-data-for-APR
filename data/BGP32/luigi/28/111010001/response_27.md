### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the class `HiveCommandClient` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database with optional partition.
2. The function utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is failing to correctly determine whether a table exists.
4. The issue lies in the way the command is being executed and checked for existence in the Hive database.
5. The current implementation does not properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and does not account for case sensitivity.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the output of the Hive command when checking for existence of a table. It also does not consider the case sensitivity of the table name.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the output from `run_hive_cmd` is properly processed.
2. Check for case insensitivity when comparing table names.
3. Improve the conditional checks in the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partitions});')

            return stdout != ""

```

In the corrected version, the function now compares table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before comparison. Additionally, the conditional checks are improved to ensure whether the table exists in the Hive database.
