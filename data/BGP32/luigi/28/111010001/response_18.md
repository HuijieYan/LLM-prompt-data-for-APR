### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The function is checking for the existence of a table in a database either with or without a specific partition.
3. The issue seems to be related to the condition check on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The error message indicates that the function is returning `False` when it should have returned `True`.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The buggy function should correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and properly check if the table exists based on that output.
2. The correct condition should ensure that the table name exists in the output returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Check if the table name exists in the stdout
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_syntax = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} PARTITION ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_syntax))
            # Check if the stdout contains any result
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version correctly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for the existence of the table based on the generated output. Now the function should pass the failing test cases.
