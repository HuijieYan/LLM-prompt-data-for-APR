1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue with the logic of the `table_exists` function.

2. The potential error lies in the condition check of the function where it compares the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function with the table name for existence.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is checking for the presence of the table in the output from `run_hive_cmd` without considering multiple tables in the output separately. When the function receives output with multiple tables, it checks if the entire output contains the table name, leading to incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, we need to split the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters and check each line separately for the table name. This way, we can accurately determine the existence of the table in the Hive database.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Split the output by newlines and check each line
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` and checking each line separately, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
