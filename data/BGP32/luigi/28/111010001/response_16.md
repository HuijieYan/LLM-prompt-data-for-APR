### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class calls the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute Hive commands.
2. The first test expects the function to return false if the table is not found in the output of the Hive command.
3. The second test expects the function to return true if the table is found in the output.
4. The error is due to the function not correctly handling the output of the Hive command when the table is present.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is likely in the conditional statements that check the output of the Hive command. The function incorrectly handles multi-line output from the Hive command, causing it to return false even when the table is present.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the function checks for the presence of the table in the output of the Hive command. When the table is present, the function doesn't correctly process the multi-line output, leading to a false result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to process the multi-line output from the Hive command correctly. Specifically, it should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table is present in any of the lines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" %
                                  (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
```

Now, the function correctly splits the stdout by newline characters and checks if the table exists in any of the lines. This should fix the bug and make the function return the correct result based on the presence of the table in the output.
