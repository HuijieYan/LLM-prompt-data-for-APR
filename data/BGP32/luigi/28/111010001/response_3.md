### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command based on the parameters passed.
2. The test cases are failing because the logic inside the `table_exists` function is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise, but it's not doing so correctly.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails when the table exists, which means the conditional check inside the function is not behaving as expected.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is processed and checked.
5. The current implementation of the function does not handle the case where the table name is present in the output correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic inside the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Check if the table name is present in the output to determine if the table exists or not.
3. Adjust the conditional statements to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.
4. Ensure that the function handles both cases when a table exists and when it doesn't exist properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            # Check if the table name is in the output
            return "OK" in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            # Check if the command was successful
            return "OK" in stdout
```

By modifying the logic of the `table_exists` function to check if the output contains the "OK" string to determine table existence, the corrected version should address the bug and resolve the failing test cases.
