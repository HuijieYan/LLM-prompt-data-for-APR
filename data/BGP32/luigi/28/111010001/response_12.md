## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly handling the case where the table name is retrieved from the `stdout` of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` based on certain conditions and checks if the table name is in the output of the command.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is returning incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table.
4. The bug is likely due to how the function handles the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function correctly parses the `stdout` to identify the existence of the table.
2. Update the logic so that it correctly distinguishes between the cases where the table name is present in the output and where it is not.
   
## Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show tables in %s like '%s' partition (%s)""" % (database, table, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- The query in the `else` block is updated to correctly use the `table` variable for showing tables and checking for partitions.
- The return statement is simplified to directly check if the table name is in the `stdout`.
- This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
