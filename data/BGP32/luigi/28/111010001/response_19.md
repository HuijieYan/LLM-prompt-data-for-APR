1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive queries. The function checks if a given table exists in a specified database with an optional partition. The error occurs due to the logic used in determining the existence of the table.

2. The potential error locations are:
   - The conditional statements for checking the existence of the table.
   - The formatted strings used in constructing Hive commands.
   - The usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. When the table does not exist, the function should return False, which it currently fails to do.

4. **Strategy for fixing the bug**:
   - Modify the conditional statements to correctly check the response from `run_hive_cmd`.
   - Ensure that the function returns False if the table does not exist in the database.
   - Refactor the formatting of Hive queries to ensure consistency and correctness.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

With the corrected version of the function, it handles the response from `run_hive_cmd` appropriately and ensures that the function returns the expected boolean values based on the existence of the table in the database.
