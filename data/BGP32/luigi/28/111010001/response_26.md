1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function defined outside the class to run Hive commands. The function checks for the existence of a table in a database, and if a partition is provided, it also checks for the existence of that partition.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect formatting of the Hive command strings using `%` operator.
   - Inconsistent handling of the return value of `run_hive_cmd`.
  
3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the Hive command string in the else block of the `table_exists` function. The usage of `%` for string formatting can lead to formatting issues if not done properly. This could result in the Hive command not being executed correctly, leading to the test failures.

4. To fix the bug, we should use the `.format()` method for string formatting, as it is more robust and less error-prone than the `%` operator. Additionally, we should ensure that the return value of `run_hive_cmd` is correctly checked and handled in both branches of the if-else statement.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By utilizing the `.format()` method for string formatting, the corrected version of the function should now correctly execute the Hive commands and handle their output, fixing the bug that caused the failing tests.
