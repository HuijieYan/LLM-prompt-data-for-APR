### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is incorrectly checking the existence of a table in the Hive database by executing Hive commands.
- The error message indicates that for certain test cases, the function is returning incorrect results. This is due to the logic in the `table_exists` function failing to correctly parse the output of the Hive command.
- The `run_hive_cmd` function is used within the `table_exists` function to execute Hive commands and capture the output. There could be an issue with the handling of the command output or the comparison logic.
- The `table_exists` function should return `True` if the table exists in the database, and `False` otherwise. The incorrect results are causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be with the logic where it is determining the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive commands it runs. The function could be incorrectly parsing the output or not handling the cases where the table exists properly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to properly handle the output of the Hive commands.
2. Ensure that the function returns `True` if the table exists in the database and `False` if it does not.
3. Possibly adjust the conditions for checking the table's existence to accurately reflect the actual presence of the table in the database.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        # Check if the table exists in the stdout
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        # Check if the table exists in the stdout, and it's not an empty string
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

### Correction Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, the logic to check if the table exists has been simplified to directly compare the table name with the output from the Hive command.
2. For the case where the partition is not None, the function now checks if the table exists in the `stdout`, and also ensures that the `stdout` is not an empty string.
3. By making these changes, the function should now accurately determine whether the table exists in the Hive database and return the correct results for the test cases.
