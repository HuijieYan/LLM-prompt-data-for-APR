### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database with an optional partition. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name.
2. The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of case sensitivity in table names compared to the output of the Hive queries.
3. The issue reported on GitHub points out that Hive is case insensitive, but the function in Luigi does a direct case-sensitive comparison, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands is case insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the case sensitivity issue is addressed. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue recommendation to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
