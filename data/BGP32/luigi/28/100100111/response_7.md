### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing table names in the `stdout`.
2. The failing test cases in `hive_test.py` reveal the issue when comparing table names with different cases.
3. The bug is caused by the function not converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, leading to case-sensitive checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function now handles case insensitivity properly. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function passes all the expected test cases.
