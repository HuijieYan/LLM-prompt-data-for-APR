### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing table names. The function is expected to check if a table exists in Hive, but it fails to do so correctly in the test cases provided.

The test cases in `hive_test.py` provide various scenarios where the expected behavior is not met due to the case sensitivity issue.

### Error location:
The main error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive in a case-sensitive manner.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is the direct comparison of the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failures in scenarios where the table names have different cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures case insensitivity and allows the function to correctly identify if a table exists in Hive.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison.

With this correction, the function will now be able to correctly identify if a table exists in Hive by considering case insensitivity.
