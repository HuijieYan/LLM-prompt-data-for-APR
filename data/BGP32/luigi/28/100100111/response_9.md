After analyzing the buggy function and failing test, it's evident that the bug arises from case sensitivity in comparing table names. The function is not handling case-insensitive comparisons correctly, leading to failing tests. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and stdout is done case-insensitively.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive match, which addresses the issue reported in GitHub.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and resolve the problem with case sensitivity in table name comparisons.
