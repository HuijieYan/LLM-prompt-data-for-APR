### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database. However, there is a bug related to case sensitivity causing the test to fail.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the table exists, leading to failures in the provided test cases.
3. The bug is related to case sensitivity in the comparison of table names. The test expects case-insensitive behavior, but the function `table_exists` does not handle it correctly, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the tables in the database needs to be case-insensitive. Changing the comparison to lower-case will resolve the issue.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables in the database to lower-case before comparison, the function `table_exists` will now be case-insensitive and pass the provided test cases.
