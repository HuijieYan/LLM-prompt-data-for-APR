### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is checking if a table exists in a database in Hive. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names.
2. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name from the database with the input table name.
3. The bug causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases than expected due to the case sensitivity issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name from the database and the input table name to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
5. The updated function below addresses the case sensitivity issue and should resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly checks for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner. Therefore, it should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue regarding case sensitivity in table names.
