### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, with an option to specify a partition. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing table names.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands, leading to test failures related to case sensitivity.
3. The bug is confirmed by the failing test cases where the table names are shown in different cases in the output compared to the input, causing the function to return incorrect results. The GitHub issue confirms that the function should be case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands is case insensitive.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.split())
```

By converting both the table name and the output table names to lowercase during comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive, as required by the GitHub issue. This will fix the bug and make the function behave correctly in all test cases.
