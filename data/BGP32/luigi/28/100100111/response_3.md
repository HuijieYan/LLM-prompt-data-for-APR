**Analysis:**

1. **Bug Description:** The current `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. This causes the test cases to fail when trying to match table names in different cases.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. The function needs to account for case insensitivity.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
    - In the failing test case, the function is not handling the case insensitivity of table names in Hive.
    - The function directly compares the table name with the stdout from Hive without considering case differences.
    - This issue was reported in the GitHub issue stating that table names are returned in lowercase while the function checks in the original case.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
    - Modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case insensitive.
    - Use lowercase comparison between the table name and the output to ensure a match irrespective of case.
    - Update the function to handle case differences appropriately.
  
5. **Corrected Version of the Function**:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
This corrected version of the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
