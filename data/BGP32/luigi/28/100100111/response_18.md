### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file doesn't handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
2. The failing test in `hive_test.py` checks for the behavior when the table name has different cases, but the function doesn't return the expected results.
3. The issue on GitHub (#896) confirms the problem and provides a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
4. The bug occurs due to a mismatch between the table name case and the case of names returned from Hive.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug exists in the `table_exists` function because it doesn't consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive query. In scenarios where the table names have different cases between the input and the output, the function fails to return the correct result. This results in failing tests when the table name is checked with different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version of the function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
