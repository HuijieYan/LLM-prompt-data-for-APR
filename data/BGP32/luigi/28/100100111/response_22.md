### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command and analyzing the output. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names. According to the GitHub issue, Hive is case insensitive, so the function should also be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Error location
The error is likely due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names returned from Hive with the input table names.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table names. Hive is case insensitive, so table names might be returned in a different case than provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the table names in the Hive command output is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the table names in the output to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases provided.
