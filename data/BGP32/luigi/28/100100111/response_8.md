### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database. However, the current implementation does not handle case-insensitive comparisons properly, leading to test failures.
2. The failing test case aims to verify the behavior of the `table_exists` function for different scenarios involving table names with varying cases.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command not being case-insensitive, leading to inconsistencies when checking for table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output to be case-insensitive using lowercase conversion for both strings before comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to handle both scenarios of partitioned and non-partitioned tables with case-insensitive comparisons.
3. Ensure that the corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
4. Update the function to return `True` when the table exists in the case-insensitive comparison and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive (using `lower()`), the corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
