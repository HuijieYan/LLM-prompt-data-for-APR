### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in the specified database with optional partition information in Hive. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name (case sensitive) with the table names retrieved from the Hive command's output (potentially case insensitive).
3. The bug is causing the test cases to fail when comparing table names with different cases, leading to incorrect results. The expected output should be insensitive to the case of the table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.
5. We need to modify the `table_exists` function to ensure the case-insensitive comparison.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the table names from the Hive command's output to lowercase, it ensures a case-insensitive comparison. This change should address the bug and make the function behavior consistent with the expected results.
