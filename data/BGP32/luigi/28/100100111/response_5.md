### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database in Hive. The bug arises from the case sensitivity during the comparison of table names which causes the test cases to fail.

### Identifying potential error locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. In the first `if` block where `table` is compared with `stdout`.
2. In the second `if` block where `stdout` is directly returned as a boolean result.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table names without considering case sensitivity. As a result, when the table names in the actual output (`stdout`) and the table being checked (`table`) have different cases, the comparison fails and returns incorrect results. 

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table names case insensitive. We should convert both the `table` and the names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is done regardless of case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive with `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we address the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports. The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases by handling case sensitivity correctly.
