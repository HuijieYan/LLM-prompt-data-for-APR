### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has an issue where the comparison of table names is case sensitive, causing test failures in the test cases provided in `hive_test.py`. The GitHub issues #896 and related discussions indicate that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence using Hive commands.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The comparison of `table` in `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to test failures when the table names are in different cases.
2. The logic for comparison might not handle different cases of table names correctly.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` performs a direct comparison of the table name with the output received from the Hive command, which leads to case sensitivity issues. When the table names are not in the exact case as expected in the `stdout`, the function fails to recognize the table's existence.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it case insensitive. This approach will ensure that the function can correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of the case used in the input parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method. This modification makes the comparison case insensitive, enabling the function to correctly identify the table's existence in Hive.

By incorporating this adjustment, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined previously.
