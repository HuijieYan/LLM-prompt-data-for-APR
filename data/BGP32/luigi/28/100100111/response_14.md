### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command, but it has a bug related to case sensitivity comparison.
2. The bug is caused by not handling case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the stdout from the Hive command.
3. The failing test cases are related to different scenarios of checking table existence with varying case sensitivity in the table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison to handle case insensitivity correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function to handle both partitioned and non-partitioned table existence checking.
3. Use the updated function to satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issues #896 and the related discussion.
