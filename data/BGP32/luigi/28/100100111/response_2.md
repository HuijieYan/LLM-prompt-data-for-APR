### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`
2. The function checks if a table exists in a Hive database based on the provided parameters.
3. The bug arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the stdout from the Hive command.
4. The failing test cases indicate that the function is failing due to case differences between the table names.
5. The issue on GitHub (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing the table name in lowercase.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name. The function is looking for an exact match of the table name in the stdout from the Hive command, leading to failures in cases where the table names differ in case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code uses `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for case-insensitive comparison. This modification ensures that the function can handle case differences in table names correctly.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will pass all the test cases and meet the expectations outlined for each case. It also addresses the GitHub issue (#896) about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
