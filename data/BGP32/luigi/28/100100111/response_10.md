### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a logic issue where it does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The failing test functions in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` check whether the `table_exists` function correctly handles different scenarios related to table existence and case sensitivity.
3. The failing test cases show that the function fails when dealing with different capitalization of table names due to the case sensitivity issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the function not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. As a result, the function fails to correctly identify the table's existence in certain scenarios where the table name capitalization differs.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `if` conditions in the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
