### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
2. The function has two conditional blocks based on the presence of the `partition` parameter.
3. The bug may be related to case sensitivity while comparing table names in different cases.
4. The failing test case expects case insensitivity in table name comparison.
5. The provided GitHub issue (Fix #896) also mentions making `table_exists` case insensitive.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises when comparing the table name in the `stdout` (result of the Hive command) with the provided table name. If the table name in `stdout` is in a different case than the table name provided, the comparison fails. This is not desirable behavior, as Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the comparison of table names is case insensitive.
2. Convert both the table name in `stdout` and the provided table name to lowercase before comparison.
3. Modify the `table_exists` function to make the table name comparison case insensitive as per the suggestion in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected code ensures that both the provided table name and the table names in stdout are compared in a case-insensitive manner by converting them to lowercase before the comparison. This modification aligns with the expected behavior as per the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
