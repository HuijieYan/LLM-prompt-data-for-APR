### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug causes issues due to case sensitivity in table names, leading to failing tests. The `stdout` output is compared with the table name directly without considering case sensitivity. The failing test cases reflect different scenarios where the bug is causing failures.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `table` variable is not converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout`, leading to case sensitivity issues. In Case 2 and Case 5, the table names are in different cases causing the bug to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` variable is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout`. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and address the failing test cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting the `table` variable to lowercase before comparing it with `stdout`, the corrected code ensures case-insensitive comparison, fixing the bug and passing the failing test cases.
