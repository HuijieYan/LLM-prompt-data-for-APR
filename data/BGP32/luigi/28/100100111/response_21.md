### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. The bug occurs in the comparison of table names, specifically due to case sensitivity. The failing test cases are designed to cover scenarios where the case of the table names might cause the function to return incorrect results.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the comparison of `table` variable with the contents of `stdout`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison should be done after converting both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function is performing a case-sensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output of the Hive command, without considering the case-insensitivity of Hive itself. This causes the function to sometimes return incorrect results when the cases do not match.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison operation to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output of the command to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive through the use of `lower()` on both the `table` and `stdout`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
