### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it is not handling case sensitivity correctly and causing the tests to fail.
2. The bug is related to comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is expecting case-insensitive behavior while checking table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case insensitive. The function should convert both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide case-insensitive table existence checking as expected.
