### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file fails to handle case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table. This results in failing test cases provided in the `hive_test.py` file.

### Identified Error Locations:
The bug occurs in the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout, as the table name is not converted to lowercase for accurate comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function does not consider case sensitivity when checking if a table exists. This issue is mentioned in GitHub issues #896 and requests for a fix to make the `table_exists()` function case insensitive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, as requested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout
``` 

By converting both the table name and the tables listed in stdout to lowercase for comparison, the corrected function now performs case-insensitive checks for table existence. The provided test cases will now pass as expected.
