The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not case insensitive when checking for existing tables in Hive. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases. The missing case insensitivity check needs to be added to ensure the function correctly identifies tables regardless of case.

### Error locations:
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
2. The function does not account for possible case differences in the table names returned by Hive.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug stems from the function directly comparing the provided table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures in scenarios where the table names are different only in case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By adjusting the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both table names to lowercase before comparing them, the corrected function now addresses the bug and should pass the failing test cases.
