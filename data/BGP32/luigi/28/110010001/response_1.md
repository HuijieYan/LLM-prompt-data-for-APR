### Analysis:
The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of a table. The function checks if the output from the command contains the table name to determine whether the table exists or not.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The formatting of the Hive command strings might be incorrect.
2. The condition to check for the existence of the table in the output might be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be primarily related to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being processed to determine table existence. The function expects either the table name alone or the table name followed by a newline in the output to consider the table as existing. However, in the failing tests, the output does not match these expectations, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly and modify the conditions for determining table existence based on the actual output format. We should also ensure that the Hive commands are correctly formatted for the checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. For checking table existence in the default database, we use the command `show tables in {database};` instead of `show tables like "{table}";`. This ensures that the exact match with the table name is verified.
2. We split the stdout by newline character to check if the table name exists in the list of tables returned.
3. For partitions, we construct the command string using f-strings and check if stdout is empty (indicating no partitions found).

With these corrections, the function should now correctly detect the existence of tables and partitions based on the output of the Hive commands.
