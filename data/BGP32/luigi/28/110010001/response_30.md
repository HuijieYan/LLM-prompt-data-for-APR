## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. It utilizes a `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries.
2. The function contains two branches based on whether a partition is specified or not.
3. The failing test cases show that the function is not behaving as expected, returning `False` when it should return `True`.
4. The bug may lie in the comparison logic based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't. However, the current implementation does the opposite.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Based on the logic explained, we should return `True` when the table name is found in the stdout, and `False` otherwise.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version, I modified the return statements in both branches. The function now returns `True` if `stdout` contains the table name, and `False` otherwise. This adjustment ensures that the correct result is returned based on the existence of the table.
