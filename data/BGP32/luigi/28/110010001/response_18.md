### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class. It takes a table name, an optional database name, and an optional partition specification.
2. The function is checking if a given table exists in the database using Hive commands.
3. The error message shows that the test cases are failing with assertions based on the return values from the `table_exists` function.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False` and vice versa due to incorrect logic in evaluating the stdout.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case when the stdout contains the table name and when it does not.

### Proposed Fix:
I will update the logic to properly handle the stdout to determine if the table exists in the database.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return bool(stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should correctly determine if the table exists in the database based on the stdout received from the Hive commands.
