### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `table_exists` is a method within the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if a table exists.
3. The error message indicates that the function is returning incorrect values when checking if a table exists.
4. The bug seems to be related to the way the function is determining the existence of the table and handling the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function:
    - The function checks if 'table in stdout' to determine if the table exists, but it does not handle the multiple lines responses correctly.
    - When there are multiple tables or partitions in the response, the function does not accurately determine the existence of the specific table provided as input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The function should split the output by newline characters and then check for the table existence in each line.
- Additionally, the function should return `False` if the search fails for all the tables in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.splitlines()
        
        return any(table in line for line in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Just return bool value
        
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` by lines and checking for table existence in each line, the corrected function should accurately determine if a specific table exists in the Hive database.
