### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is trying to check if a given table exists in a specified database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of a table. There are issues with how the output of the Hive command is being processed to determine table existence.
3. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the correct results for table existence, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly captures the output of the Hive command and correctly identifies the existence of a table.
5. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function is presented below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))

        # Remove unnecessary characters and white spaces from the output
        stdout = stdout.strip()

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, indicating table exists
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})"""
                              .format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        # Remove unnecessary characters and white spaces from the output
        stdout = stdout.strip()
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, indicating table exists
```

By properly handling the output of the Hive commands, trimming unnecessary characters and white spaces before checking for table existence, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases.
