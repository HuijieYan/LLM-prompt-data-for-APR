#### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database.
- The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute `hive` commands and obtain the stdout response.
- The function then checks if the table name is present in the stdout response to determine if the table exists.
- The failing tests show that the function is returning incorrect results when checking for table existence.
- The tests are mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function to simulate different stdout responses from `hive` commands.

#### Error:
- The bug in the function lies in the logic where it checks for the existence of a table in the stdout response.
- The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when determining if a table exists or not.
- The function fails to handle the presence of a newline character in the stdout response, leading to incorrect comparisons.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly handle cases where the table name is present in the stdout response.
- Account for the newline character in the stdout response to ensure accurate comparison when checking for table existence.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:   
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

#### Explanation:
- In the corrected version of the function, the `strip()` method is applied to the stdout response in the case of no partition to remove any leading or trailing whitespace including newline characters.
- The function uses f-string formatting for the hive command to handle the partition case and also correctly calls the `partition_spec()` method to generate the partition specification.
- The function then checks if the stdout is not empty to determine the existence of the table.

By using these modifications, the corrected function should now accurately determine whether a table exists in the specified database and pass the failing tests.
