### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run hive commands and check if a table exists.
2. The error message indicates that the test cases are failing due to incorrect return values from the `table_exists` function.
3. The first test case expects `False`, but the actual return value is `True`.
4. The bug is caused by the condition check at the end of the function. If `stdout` is not empty (which means the table exists), it should return True, but in the current implementation, it's returning the opposite.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the return values in the `table_exists` function.

### Bug fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the return values in the `table_exists` function. If `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists, we should return `True`. Otherwise, we should return `False`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By correcting the return values based on the presence of `stdout`, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
