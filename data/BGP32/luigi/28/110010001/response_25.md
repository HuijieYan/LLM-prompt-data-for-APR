### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists()` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a specific table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The error messages are indicating that the test cases are failing because the function is not returning the expected values.
4. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison or parsing of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect evaluation of table existence.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` by checking if the table exists in the output. The comparison logic should be improved to correctly parse and evaluate the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. In the `if` block, `stdout` is checked if `table` is in the output. The returned value is now parsed correctly by splitting the output on newlines.
2. In the `else` block, the function now directly returns a boolean value based on whether `stdout` is truthy or not.

By making these changes, the corrected function now properly evaluates the table existence based on the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which should fix the failing test cases.
