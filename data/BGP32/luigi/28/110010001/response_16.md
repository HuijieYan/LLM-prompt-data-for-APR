### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists.
3. The error messages indicate that the tests are failing when the function is expected to return `True`, but it is returning `False`.
4. The bug is likely due to issues with parsing the output of the Hive commands and checking for the existence of the table.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for the existence of the table in the Hive output. The function needs to properly parse the output returned by the Hive commands to accurately determine if the table exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to properly parse and handle the output of the Hive command invocation.
2. Modify the condition for checking the existence of the table to ensure it accurately determines if the table exists based on the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Check the table name in stdout and return True if found
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            # Check for the existence of partitions specified in stdout
            return "No partitions" not in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- In the `if` block, the function splits the `stdout` by spaces and then checks if the `table` is in the split output to determine if the table exists.
- In the `else` block, the function checks if the stdout contains the message "No partitions" to determine if the table doesn't have any partitions.

By making these modifications, the function should now properly handle the Hive command output and accurately determine the existence of the table.
