1. Analysis:
- The function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using `hive` invocations.

2. Potential error locations:
- The condition for checking if a table exists may not be correctly implemented.
- The function `run_hive_cmd` is being used to execute hive commands, which might not be returning the expected output.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The failing test is asserting `True` for table existence, but the current implementation of `table_exists` is returning `False` for existing tables due to the check logic.
- The output from the `run_hive_cmd` function might not be structured as expected, leading to incorrect evaluations in the `table_exists` function.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to properly check for the existence of the table.
- Ensure that the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is correctly processed to determine if the table exists.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout)  # Check for non-empty stdout for table existence
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
        if stdout and table in stdout:
            return True
    return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The query to show tables is modified to `show tables in {table}` to list all tables in the database.
- The logic for checking table existence is revised to return `True` if the table is found in the output and `False` otherwise.
- The `bool(stdout)` check ensures that an empty string in `stdout` is treated as `False`.

With these changes, the function should correctly determine the existence of tables in the database.
