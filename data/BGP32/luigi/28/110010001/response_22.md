1. Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. The function is intended to check if a specified table exists in a given database. The function uses the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine table existence.

2. Error Location:
The potential error locations in the code are:
- The formatting of the Hive command strings might be incorrect.
- The logic to check if the table exists based on the output of `run_hive_cmd` might be flawed.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the logic in the `table_exists` function. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is used to check if the table exists based on the output, but it might not be handling the different cases properly, leading to incorrect results.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks the output of `run_hive_cmd` for table existence. We should modify the logic to handle different cases and conditions properly.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

By making the above changes, the function now explicitly checks if `stdout` is not `None` before evaluating the table existence condition correctly. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
