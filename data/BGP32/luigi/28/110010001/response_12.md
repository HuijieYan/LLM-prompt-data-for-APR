### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` uses the `run_hive_cmd()` function to execute Hive commands to check if a table exists in a database.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command and examining the output.
3. The error messages in the failing test indicate that the function is returning incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table. The expected output is not matching the actual output.
4. The bug is likely in the condition where the function checks if the table name is present in the stdout of the Hive command output. The condition is not handling the whitespace/newline characters in the stdout correctly.
5. A strategy for fixing the bug is to strip any whitespace characters from the stdout before checking if the table name is present in it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Strip any whitespace characters from the stdout
            stdout = stdout.strip()
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            # Strip any whitespace characters from the stdout
            stdout = stdout.strip()
            return bool(stdout)
```

By adding `stdout = stdout.strip()` after getting the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd()`, we can remove any leading, trailing, or extra whitespace characters that might be causing the incorrect comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison of the table name in the stdout is done accurately.
