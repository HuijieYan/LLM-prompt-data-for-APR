### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a database by using `hive` invocations.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not correctly identifying whether a table exists or not.
4. The bug may be related to how the function processes the output of the `hive` commands and determines if a table exists or not.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect parsing of the output from the `hive` commands.
2. The condition `if stdout:` might not be suitable for checking if a table exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The buggy function returns `True` if the `stdout` variable is not empty, which may not accurately indicate if the table exists.
2. The function does not handle the case where the table is not found correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Parse the output of the `hive` commands to properly check if the table exists.
2. Check for specific conditions in the output that indicate the existence of the table.
3. Consider updating the conditions for returning `True` or `False` based on the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if the stdout is not empty, indicating the table exists
```

By splitting the `stdout` by lines and checking if the table is in the output, the corrected function accurately determines if the table exists. Additionally, the return statement has been simplified to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty. This should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
