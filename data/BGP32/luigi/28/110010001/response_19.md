### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a given table exists in a specific database and partition.
2. The issue seems to be with how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for the existence of the table.
3. The error messages indicate that the `assertTrue` assertion fails because the function is returning `False` instead of `True` when checking if the table exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses and evaluates the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

### Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split("\n")

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show tables like '{1}' partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
```

In the corrected version:
- The `run_hive_cmd` result is split by newline character to create a list of table names returned by the command.
- The existence of the table is checked by verifying if the `table` is in the list of table names returned.
- Adjusted the query syntax to properly handle partitions when checking for table existence.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly identify whether the table exists and pass the failing test cases.
