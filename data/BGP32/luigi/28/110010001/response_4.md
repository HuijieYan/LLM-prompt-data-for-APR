### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is attempting to check whether a specified table exists in the given database.
- The function is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries and retrieve the response.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the returned value from the `table_exists` function is incorrect, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the table exists might be incorrect.
2. There could be issues in constructing the Hive query strings.
3. Handling of partitioned tables might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is likely in the condition where the function checks if the table exists.
- The buggy function is directly checking if the stdout response from the Hive query contains the table name, which can lead to false positives or negatives based on the structure of the response.
- Currently, the implementation just checks if the table name exists in the stdout response.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the function to parse the Hive query response in a more structured way.
- Check the list of tables or partitions in the response to determine if the specified table exists.
- Update the return logic to return `True` only if the exact table name is found in the response.
- Ensure the function handles partitioned tables correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return partition in partitions

# Make sure to import the necessary functions and classes for the corrected version
from luigi.contrib.hive import HiveClient, run_hive_cmd
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. The function now splits the stdout response from Hive to get a list of tables or partitions.
2. It then checks if the specified table or partition exists in that list.
3. The correct table or partition existence is checked, and the function returns `True` only if the exact table/partition is found.
4. Ensure the necessary functions and classes are imported at the correct location.
