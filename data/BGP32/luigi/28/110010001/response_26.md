### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database by executing a Hive command. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run the command and check the stdout for presence of the table name.
   
2. The potential error location in the buggy function lies in the conditional checks for the stdout value after executing the Hive commands.

3. The buggy function fails to correctly identify if a table exists due to the incorrect handling of stdout. The bug is causing the function to always return `False` regardless of the actual presence of the table. This behavior results in failing test cases where the expected outcome is not met.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Change the conditional check for stdout from `return stdout` to `return table in stdout` for the case where `partition` is `None`.
   - Modify the condition for the else block to correctly check if the table is present in the stdout obtained by running the Hive command.
   
5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```
