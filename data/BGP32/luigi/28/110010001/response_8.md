### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a given table exists in a specified database with an optional partition. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.

### Issues
1. The first issue is likely with the condition check in the `if` block where it tries to see if the table exists by checking if the table name is present in the output of the Hive command. This might not work as expected due to formatting issues with the Hive command output.

2. The second issue is with the Hive command being used in the `else` block when the partition is specified. The formatting of the command and the `partition_spec` method might cause the command to fail or not return the expected output.

### Bug Cause
The test case is failing because the logic for checking the table existence in the `table_exists` function is incorrect. This is causing the function to return incorrect values, leading to failing assertions in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the condition check logic in the first `if` block to properly handle the output of the Hive command when checking for table existence.
2. Correct the formatting issues in the Hive command used in the `else` block along with the `partition_spec` method.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
        # Check for table existence based on output format
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        # Check if any partitions found
        return 'No entries' not in stdout
```

### Explanation
1. In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the differing output formats of the Hive commands to check for table existence and partition details.
2. The condition checks are modified to accurately determine the existence of the table based on the output from the Hive commands.
3. The corrected version should address the issues identified and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test cases.
