1. Analysis:
The buggy function "table_exists" is part of the "HiveCommandClient" class in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file. This function is used to check if a table exists in a given database using hive commands. The function is supposed to return True if the table exists, otherwise False. The error message shows that the test cases are failing due to incorrect return values.

2. Potential error locations:
a. The condition checking for the existence of the table might not be working as expected.
b. The way the output from the hive command is checked and processed could be causing the issue.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely due to how the function processes the output from the hive command. The function should return True only if the output contains the name of the table, but it seems to return True even if the table name is not present in the output.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table name exists in the output from the hive command. We should ensure that the function only returns True if the table name is present in the output.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split("\n")
```

In the corrected version of the function, we split the stdout by newline character and then check if the table name exists in the resulting list. This way, we ensure that the function only returns True if the table name is explicitly present in the output.
