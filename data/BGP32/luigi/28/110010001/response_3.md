### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a given table exists in a specified database.
2. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.
3. The error message indicates that the test cases are failing because the function is returning incorrect results. It fails when the table actually exists.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks the existence of a table and processes the output from the Hive command. It does not correctly handle the case when the table exists.
   
### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to properly parse the output of the Hive command and check if the table exists.
2. Ensure that the function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not.
3. Handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` method accurately to determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions `%s` partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split()
```

In the corrected version, we split the stdout by newline character to compare against the table name, thereby checking if the table exists in the list of tables. This ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of the table and returns the expected boolean values.
