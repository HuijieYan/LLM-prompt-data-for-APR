1. Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a specific table exists in a given Hive database. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the correct result when checking for the existence of a table.

2. Potential Error Locations:
a. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` might not be evaluating as expected.
b. The construction of the Hive command in the `else` block might have issues.
c. The comparison of the `stdout` result might be incorrect.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function's logic seems to be incorrectly handling the stdout output of the Hive commands. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` could be problematic, and the construction of the Hive command in the `else` block may not be generating the expected command.

4. Bug Fixing Strategy:
a. Modify the condition containing `stdout and table in stdout` to ensure the existence check is done correctly.
b. Verify the construction of the Hive command in the `else` block to match the expected syntax for checking table existence.
c. Ensure the comparison of the `stdout` result is proper to determine the existence of the table.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- The condition `stdout and table in stdout` is modified to `stdout and table in stdout.split()` to properly check for the existence of the table in the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command.
- The construction of the Hive command in the `else` block is adjusted to match the expected syntax for showing partitions.
- The comparison of the `stdout` result is simplified by returning `bool(stdout)` to ensure proper handling of the stdout output.

These modifications should address the bug in the `table_exists` function and allow it to pass the failing tests.
