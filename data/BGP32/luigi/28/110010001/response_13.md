### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries.
3. The error message indicates that the test cases for checking table existence are failing, with the specific assertion errors indicating that False is not being correctly evaluated as true when a table exists.
4. The bug is likely related to the way the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the function correctly processes the output from `run_hive_cmd` and returns the correct results based on table existence.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # Check if the table names are present exactly in the output
        return bool(stdout) and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Check if partitions are present in the output
        return bool(stdout)

# Explanation:
# 1. Use the split function to separate the output into lines for easy comparison.
# 2. Return False if stdout is empty, otherwise check for table name existence.
# 3. For partitions, check if the output is not empty to confirm existence.
