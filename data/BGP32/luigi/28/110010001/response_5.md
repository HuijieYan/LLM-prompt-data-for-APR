### Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is designed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. However, the bug in the function seems to be related to the condition checking and return logic of the function, based on the error message from the failing test.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to be in the condition checking part of the function. The function should return `True` if the table exists according to the output of the `run_hive_cmd`, but the logic to determine this is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When the `run_hive_cmd` outputs 'OK' (without a newline character), the function is incorrectly returning `False`.
2. When the `run_hive_cmd` outputs 'OK\nmytable', the function is correctly returning `True`, but the logic can be simplified.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for checking the presence of the table in the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Simplify the return statements to make the code more readable and maintainable.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case when `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the `table` exists in the lines of `stdout` using `splitlines()` and returns `True` if found.
- For the case when `partition` is not `None`, the function checks if the `stdout` is not `None` and returns the result.

This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing tests.
