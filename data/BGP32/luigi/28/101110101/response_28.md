## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and its failing test cases, we can identify the cause of the bug in the function. The bug arises from the fact that the "stdout" variable is being checked directly for truthiness, which can lead to unexpected behavior given the variations in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to explicitly check if the table exists in the output received from `run_hive_cmd` instead of relying on truthiness of the output string.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition {self.partition_spec(partition)}')
            return True if stdout else False
```

By explicitly checking if the table exists in the output, the corrected function should now pass all the provided failing test cases. The correction ensures that the function correctly handles the output from `run_hive_cmd` and behaves as expected.
