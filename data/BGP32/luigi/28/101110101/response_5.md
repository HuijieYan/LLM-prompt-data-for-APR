## Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable. The function is expecting `stdout` to contain the table name in case of table existence, but it is directly comparing the table name with `stdout`, which is not correct.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `stdout` variable into lines and then check if the `table` exists in any of those lines. This will accurately determine the existence of the table in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly determine if a table exists based on the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases provided earlier.
