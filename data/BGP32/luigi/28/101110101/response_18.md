## Bug Fix
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the check on whether the table exists in the stdout. The implementation is flawed because it checks if the table name is within the stdout directly, which can lead to false positives in certain cases. Instead, we should split the stdout by newline characters and compare each line with the expected table name.

Additionally, the function is calling `run_hive_cmd` with incorrect formatting when querying partitions. The corrected version should pass the correct parameters to `run_hive_cmd`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        partition_query = "=".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, partition_query))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version splits the stdout by `\n` character and checks if the table name exists in the list of tables correctly. It also formats the partition query correctly when querying for partitions. 

With this corrected version, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
