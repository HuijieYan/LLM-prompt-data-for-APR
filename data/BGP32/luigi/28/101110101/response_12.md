The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to the way the stdout variable is checked for the table existence. The function expects the stdout output to contain the table name when checking for its existence. However, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not accurate. It should check if the table name is present in the lines of stdout instead.

To fix this bug, we need to check each line of the stdout separately to find the table name. If the table name is found in any line, then the table exists. Otherwise, it does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return any(t.rstrip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version checks each line of the stdout separately to find the exact match for the table name. This should resolve the issue with the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
