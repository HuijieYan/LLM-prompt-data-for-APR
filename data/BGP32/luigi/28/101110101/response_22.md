The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it handles the comparison between the expected table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation checks for the existence of the table name in the output string using a simple substring search, which can lead to false positives when the table name is part of another name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that only exact matches are considered as valid table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout string into lines and checking for an exact match with the table name, we ensure that false positives are eliminated.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases given the expected input/output values.
