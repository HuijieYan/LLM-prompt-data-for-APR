### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks whether a table exists in a database, with an optional partition specification. It relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The issue arises in the way it handles the output (`stdout`) of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Identifying the bug
1. In the first `if` block, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` after running the Hive command. However, a truthy check on `stdout` may not be sufficient, leading to incorrect evaluations.
2. In the `else` block, where there is a partition specified, the Hive command concatenation seems incorrect. It does not properly format the partition query, likely leading to failures in detecting partitions.

### Bug cause
1. In the failing test case, the `table_exists` function is not correctly evaluating the output `stdout` to check for the existence of the table. This causes a mismatch in the expectation of the test case, resulting in failures.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Adjust the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function to properly handle the `stdout` when determining table existence.
2. Ensure that the Hive command string generation for partitions is correctly formatted to successfully detect partitions.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        partition_query = ' and '.join(['{0} = \'{1}\''.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_query))
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Justification for the correction
1. In the corrected version, the function uses `split()` on `stdout` to properly separate the table names and check for exact matches when no partition is specified.
2. For the partition case, the function formats the partition key-value pairs correctly and ensures the Hive command is built accurately before execution. The `bool(stdout)` conversion handles empty response cases.

By implementing these corrections, the `table_exists` function should now correctly detect the existence of tables and partitions as expected in the tests.
