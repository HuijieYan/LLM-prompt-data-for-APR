The bug in the provided `table_exists` function lies in the condition for checking whether the table exists or not based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug is caused by incorrect logic in handling the stdout output.

The issue is that the function expects the stdout to directly contain the table name when checking if the table exists. However, in some cases, the stdout contains additional text along with the table name, leading to incorrect evaluation of the condition.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to properly parse and check the stdout for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This version splits the `stdout` string by whitespace, allowing for proper checking of tables in the stdout output.

The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned earlier.
