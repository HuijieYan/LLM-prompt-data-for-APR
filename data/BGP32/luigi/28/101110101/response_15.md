### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the stdout string with the table name. In the case where `stdout` is `OK` or `OK\nmytable`, the function checks if the table name is present in the stdout using the line `return stdout and table in stdout`. This comparison fails because the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is not evaluating as expected. As a result, the test cases fail, leading to assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how we check for the existence of the table name in the `stdout` string. We can split the `stdout` string by newlines and then check if the table name is present in any of the split lines. This will address the issue of comparison and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all test cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` string on newlines before checking if the table name is present, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly. This corrected version of the function should now pass all test cases and return the expected output values.
