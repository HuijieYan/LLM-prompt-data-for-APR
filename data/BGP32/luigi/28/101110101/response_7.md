## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` has two main issues:
1. In the first if statement, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is checking if `stdout` is not empty and if `table` is in `stdout`. This logic is incorrect because the `stdout` variable could be non-empty but may not contain the entire table name. It should be checking if the table name is in the `stdout` without considering whether `stdout` contains other information.
2. In the else block, the constructed `stdout` variable includes the output of running a Hive command that involves the `partition_spec` method. However, the `partition_spec` method is being called incorrectly with incorrect string formatting, causing the method to return unexpected values.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test case where `self.client.table_exists("MyTable")` is called, the buggy function fails to correctly identify the table due to case sensitivity. The buggy function incorrectly verifies the table's existence by checking if `table in stdout` with the given `stdout` value. This approach fails in scenarios where the table names don't match exactly due to case sensitivity.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the first if statement needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive check on the table name in the `stdout` output. Additionally, the incorrect usage of `self.partition_spec(partition)` in the else block needs to be corrected by properly using the method within the string formatting. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

With these changes, the function will perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the `stdout` output when verifying the table's existence. Also, the correct method usage will ensure the `partition_spec` method returns the expected value in the Hive command.
