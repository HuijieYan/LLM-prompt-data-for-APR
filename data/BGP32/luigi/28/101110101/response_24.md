## Revised Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
       
    # the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout

        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

The bugs in the original function were that the string formatting in the second SQL query was not correct and used a wrong placeholder. Additionally, the return logic in the if-else block was unnecessary and could be simplified for better readability.

Explanation of Bug:
The bug in the original function caused incorrect SQL queries to be constructed due to wrong string formatting. This led to incorrect output checks and caused the failing tests to produce assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the string formatting in the second SQL query.
2. Simplify the return logic to remove unnecessary if-else statements.

The revised function above addresses the issues mentioned and is expected to pass all the failing test cases provided.
