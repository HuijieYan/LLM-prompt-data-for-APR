The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it returns the opposite boolean value compared to what is expected. The function should return `True` when the table exists and `False` when it does not, but it is currently doing the opposite.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the existing `if` condition in the function. We need to change the check from `stdout and table in stdout` to `stdout and table in stdout` for the case where `partition is None`. For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we can directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and return the expected boolean values for each case.
