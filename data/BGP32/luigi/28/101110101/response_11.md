## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. The issue lies in the comparison of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function with the table name. In the first case, it checks if the table name is directly present in the output, while in the second case, it constructs a more complex query to check table existence but forgets to compare it to the table name.

### Identified Issue
1. In the else part of the function where it queries partitions, the buggy function does not check if the table name exists in the stdout after the command execution.
2. The comparison logic for table existence is flawed because it only checks for the presence of the table name without considering other outputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the else part of the function to correctly check if the table name exists in the output of the command that is executed.
2. Revise the comparison logic to ensure that the exact table name being searched for is present in the stdout.

## Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show tables in %s like '%s' partition(%s)""" % (database, table, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
```

By updating the else part of the function and properly splitting the stdout to check for the presence of the table in the result, the corrected function should now pass all the test cases and return the expected results.
