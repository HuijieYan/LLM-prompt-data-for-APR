The bug in the provided code is in the way the function `table_exists` is handling the `stdout` variable. The function is expecting `stdout` to be either a string containing the table name or partitions, but the comparison isn't correct.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, for the case where `partition` is `None`, the function splits the `stdout` by newline character `\n` and then checks if the `table` is in the list of strings obtained after splitting. This correctly handles cases where `stdout` contains multiple tables separated by newline characters.

For the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function just checks if `stdout` exists or not using `bool(stdout)`.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
