The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the function checks if the table exists. In the `table_exists` function, when checking if the table exists with the provided name, it reads the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and looks for the table name in it. This approach does not handle the cases where the table name is a substring of another table name in the output. To fix this, we should modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to ensure that the table name is matched exactly.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()  # check for exact match
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty, else False
```

This corrected version improves the table existence check by splitting the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and ensuring that the table name is matched exactly in the list of tables. Additionally, the function now returns `True` if stdout is not empty, indicating that the table exists, and `False` otherwise. This updated logic should fix the bug present in the original function implementation.
