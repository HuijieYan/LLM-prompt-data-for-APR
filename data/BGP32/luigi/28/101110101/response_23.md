### Solution:

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name. The function checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string directly, which can lead to incorrect results when there are similar table names or when the table name is a substring of another table name.

To fix this issue, we can modify the comparison by splitting the `stdout` string into lines and then checking each line for an exact match with the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            if stdout:
                return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
            else:
                return False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
- The modified version checks if the exact table name exists in any line of the `stdout` output after splitting it by lines.
- By using `any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))`, we ensure an exact match is found.
- This change addresses the issue of incorrect comparisons when dealing with multiple tables in the output.

With this corrected version, the function should now pass all the failing test cases provided. Please ensure to update the function in the specified file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` before running the tests again.
