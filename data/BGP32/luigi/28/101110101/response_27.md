## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. The problem is that when the `stdout` contains multiple lines, the `table in stdout` check will fail because it checks for an exact match of the table name in the entire `stdout` string.

In the failing test case, when `table_exists` is called with a table name `'MyTable'`, the function incorrectly returns False because it cannot find an exact match in the multi-line `stdout`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` into lines and then check if the table exists in any of those lines.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

After the correction, the `table_exists` function should handle multi-line `stdout` correctly and return True if the table exists in any line, as expected. This change ensures that the function behaves as intended in all test cases.
