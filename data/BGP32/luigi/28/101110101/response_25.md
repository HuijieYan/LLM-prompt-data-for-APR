The bug in the provided `table_exists` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable. The function is trying to check if the table exists by searching for the table name in the `stdout` output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the comparison is not working as intended, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of how we check for the existence of the table in the `stdout`. We will split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # If the stdout is not empty, consider the table exists

```

With this correction, the function should now correctly check if the table exists in the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if the table name is present in any of the lines.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
