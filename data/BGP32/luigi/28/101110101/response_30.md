After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is evident that the bug lies in the conditional checks within the `table_exists` function. The function is not correctly handling the case where the table name appears in `stdout` with additional characters or newlines.

The bug arises due to the flawed logic of checking for the exact presence of the table name in the `stdout` output, leading to inconsistent results and failing assertions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of checking for the table name in the `stdout`. Instead of exact string matching, we should check if the table name is present in `stdout` as a word, ensuring that it is not part of another word or preceded/followed by other characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By splitting the `stdout` into separate lines and checking each line for the exact table name match, we ensure a more robust validation of table existence.

This correction should make the `table_exists` function pass all the failing test cases while maintaining the expected input/output values.
