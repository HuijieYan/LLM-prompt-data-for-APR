The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of `table in stdout`. The function expects `table` to be found in `stdout` when checking if a table exists in the database. However, the comparison could fail in cases where the table name is part of another word in the `stdout` output.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison statement to check for exact matches of the table name in the output. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` into lines and then checking if any line is equal to the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` into lines using `stdout.splitlines()` and checks if the table name is present in any of the lines. It also simplifies the condition for the `else` block by directly returning the boolean value of `stdout`, which will be `True` if there is any output.

With these changes, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
