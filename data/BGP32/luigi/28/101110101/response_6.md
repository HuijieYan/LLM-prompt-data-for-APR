Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the comparison of the `table` name in the `stdout`. The function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output by using `table in stdout`. However, this direct comparison is incorrect as it may match a substring of the `table` name instead of the whole name.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `stdout` based on newline characters and then check if the `table` name exactly matches any of the entries in the split list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # other functions omitted

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # stdout is either True/False, so we can directly return it
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` output by newline `\n` character and then checks if the `table` name exists in the list of split outputs. This ensures an exact match of the `table` name.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
