The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue in the logic where it checks if a table exists. The problem lies in how the function handles the `stdout` variable after running the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should check whether the table name is in the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug occurs because the original function only checks if `stdout` is not empty, which causes some tests to fail due to the incorrect comparison. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly check if the table name exists in the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return table in stdout.split("\n") if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if the table name exists in the resulting list. This approach ensures that the function correctly determines if a table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
