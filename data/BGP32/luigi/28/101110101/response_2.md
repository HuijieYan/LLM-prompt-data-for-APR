The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it handles the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function and determines if the table exists or not. The bug is leading to failing test cases where the function is returning the opposite of the expected result.

The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function may return additional characters along with the table name, like newlines. Therefore, simply checking if the table name is in the return value of `run_hive_cmd` is not sufficient.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to properly parse the return value and check if the table name is present in a valid format.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the return value of `run_hive_cmd` by lines and checking if the table name is present in the resulting list, we can accurately determine if the table exists. This fix should make the function pass all the failing test cases.
