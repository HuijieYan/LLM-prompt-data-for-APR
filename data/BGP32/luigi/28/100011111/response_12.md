### Analyzing the bug:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the provided tests due to case sensitivity in comparing the table names.
2. The bug is causing the assertion errors in the failing tests, where the expected values are not matching the actual values due to case differences.
3. The bug arises from not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive queries.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive query is case insensitive.
5. The bug has been raised as GitHub issue #896 with a proposed solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive query. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will now compare the table name and the stdout output in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the assertion errors in the failing tests.

By incorporating this change, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify the existence of tables irrespective of case differences in their names, resolving the bug reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
