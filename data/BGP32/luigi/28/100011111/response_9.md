### Analyzing the Bug

The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `hive.py` file when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue arises when comparing the name of the table to the tables listed in the Hive database, where discrepancies in case sensitivity cause the tests to fail. The expected behavior is that the function should match the table name regardless of case.

### Error Cause

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names. When the table names are returned from Hive, they are in lowercase, resulting in test failures due to the mismatch in cases. The function only checks for an exact match, leading to assertions failing when comparing table names with different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of table names is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the tables listed in the Hive database to lowercase before comparing them. By doing so, the function will correctly identify the table's existence regardless of the case used. 

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function correctly identifies the table's existence without being affected by case sensitivity issues.
