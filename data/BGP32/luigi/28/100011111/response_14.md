### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is checking directly for the table name in the `stdout`, which may not match due to case sensitivity. The function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison of the `table` name and the `stdout`. The comparison does not take into account case sensitivity.

### Bug Explanation:
When the function compares the `table` name with the `stdout`, it does a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity. This results in a mismatch when the `table` name has a different case than the one returned in the `stdout`. The function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to ensure correct results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` to be case insensitive. The comparison should be done after converting both strings to lowercase. This way, the function will correctly identify the table existence regardless of case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug reported in the failing tests.
