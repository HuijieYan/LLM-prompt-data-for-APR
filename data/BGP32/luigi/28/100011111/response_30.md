### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function results in case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name in the stdout with the provided table name. The function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to failing tests where the table names don't match due to case differences.

### Potential error locations:
The bug is likely due to the direct comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the provided table name without considering case insensitivity.

### Explanation:
The failing tests demonstrate scenarios where the provided table name and the names in the `stdout` differ in case, leading to assertion errors. The function's direct comparison without considering case insensitivity causes the bug, leading to failed tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive. By converting both the provided table name and the names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles case insensitivity appropriately. This fix addresses the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
