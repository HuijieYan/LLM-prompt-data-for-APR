### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` fails to consider case sensitivity for table names.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function doesn't correctly handle case sensitivity for table existence checks.
3. The function currently checks if the exact table name is present in the output, leading to test failures for uppercase/lowercase variations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case sensitivity correctly, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
