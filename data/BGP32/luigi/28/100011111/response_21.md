Based on the analysis provided above, the bug in the function `table_exists` is due to the case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from Hive commands. The function needs to be modified to handle case insensitivity in table names.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function introduces lowercasing for both the table name being passed as well as the output from Hive commands to ensure case insensitivity in the comparison. This change aligns with the GitHub issue and resolves the failing tests reported.

By incorporating these adjustments, the function should now correctly check for the existence of tables in Hive in a case-insensitive manner.
