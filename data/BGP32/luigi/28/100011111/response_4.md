### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the `table_exists` function is called with a table name that has different casing than the table name returned by Hive. The function is case-sensitive in comparing the table names, leading to false failures in the tests.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the comparison between the `table` parameter and the table name in `stdout`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the `table` parameter with the `stdout` which might contain the table names returned by Hive in a different case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` parameter and the table names in `stdout` to a consistent case before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive and should pass the failing tests.
