### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is not handling the case sensitivity correctly, which causes the tests to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not considering the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug reports and should now pass the failing tests.
