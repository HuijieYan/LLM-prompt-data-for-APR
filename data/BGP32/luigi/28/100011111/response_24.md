### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from running a Hive command. This leads to test failures when the table name casing does not match the output casing.

### Error Cause:
The bug arises from the failure to consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the command output. This causes the function to incorrectly evaluate the existence of a table based on case-sensitive comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the table existence, resolving the issue and allowing the function to pass the failing tests.
