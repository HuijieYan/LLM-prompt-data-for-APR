In the provided buggy function `table_exists`, the issue seems to arise from a case sensitivity problem when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects the table name in a specific case but fails to handle cases where the table name is returned in a different case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function are converted to lowercase before comparison. This modification should address the case sensitivity issue and enable the function to correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of their case.
