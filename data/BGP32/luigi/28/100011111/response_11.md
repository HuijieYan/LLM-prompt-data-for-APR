### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests because it is case-sensitive in comparing the table names extracted from the Hive output. The issue in GitHub indicates that table names in Hive are case-insensitive, but the function is treating them as case-sensitive.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of the table names extracted from the Hive output. The function compares the table names directly without considering case-insensitivity.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of table names is case-insensitive. It can be achieved by converting both the table name and the extracted table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
```

By converting both the `table` and extracted table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive and pass the failing tests.
