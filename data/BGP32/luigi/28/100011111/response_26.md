### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from a case sensitivity issue where the function fails to consider case-insensitive matching when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The failing test cases indicate that the function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly.

In both failing test cases, the expected outcome is that the function should perform a case-insensitive check to determine if the given table exists. However, the function currently does a direct comparison which leads to the assertion failures.

The `stdout` variable contains the output from Hive queries, and the function checks if the table name exists in this output without considering the case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to ensure that it performs a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version:
1. When checking for the existence of the table, both the `table` name and `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
2. The comparison is then made between the lowercase versions, ensuring a case-insensitive check.
3. For the partition case, the function directly returns the result of the `stdout` check as it does not need additional processing.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons, satisfying the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases and resolving the GitHub issue related to the case sensitivity problem.
