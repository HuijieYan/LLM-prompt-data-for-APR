### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
- The function checks if a table exists in a specific database using Hive commands but fails to consider case sensitivity, leading to failed tests due to mismatched case between the table name passed in and the table name returned from Hive.
- The error messages indicate that the function is returning a false negative for table existence in some cases where the table names are different only in case.
- The expected behavior is that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Bug:
The current implementation of the function does not account for case sensitivity when checking for table existence, leading to failed tests due to case mismatch between the expected table name and the table name returned from Hive.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name passed in and the table name returned from Hive to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name passed in and the table name returned from Hive to lowercase before the comparison, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
