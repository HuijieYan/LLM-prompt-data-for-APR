### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The failing test is related to the case sensitivity of the table name being checked against the output from Hive commands. The issue in GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Error Location
The bug in the function is primarily centered around how it compares the table name against the output from the Hive commands. The issue arises when the table names differ in case, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the function should return `True` if the table name is `'mytable'` and the output is `'OK'`. However, the comparison is case sensitive, resulting in a failed test.
   
2. In Case 2, the function should return `True` when the table name is `'MyTable'` and the output contains `'mytable'`. The string comparison does not consider case insensitivity, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive:
- Convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.
- Modify the comparison logic in the function to check for the lowercase table name within the lowercase output.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected function now converts both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.

By making this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue outlined in the GitHub issue.
