### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is not considering the case of the table name when comparing it with the output from the Hive command. The failing test cases are expecting a case-insensitive comparison for table names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function comparing the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the table name case in the output does not match the expected case.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout output, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison, which addresses the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
