### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the input table. The function does not consider the case of the table names, leading to failed test cases.

### Error Cause:
The function is failing the test cases because it does not handle the case sensitivity of table names in the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the table names in the `stdout` case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
A corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing test cases.
