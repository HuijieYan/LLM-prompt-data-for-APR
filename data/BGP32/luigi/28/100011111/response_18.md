### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function currently checks for an exact match, causing failures when the case does not match. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the content of `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that when checking for table existence, the function does not account for case differences in the table names. As a result, the function returns incorrect results when the case of the table names in the Hive output differs from the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison operation to be case-insensitive when checking if the table name exists in the Hive output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Assessment
The corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the function is now case-insensitive when checking for table existence. This fix will address the failing tests and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
