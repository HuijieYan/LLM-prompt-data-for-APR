### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` fails in the tests due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from the `stdout` with the input table name. The function expects an exact match without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located at the comparison line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
where the input table name and the table name extracted from `stdout` are compared directly without any case insensitivity handling.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the extracted table name with the input table name.
- The tests fail because the table names may have different cases, and the direct comparison does not consider this discrepancy.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the extracted table name and the input table name to lowercase (or uppercase) for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with case insensitivity handling:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Conclusion:
By implementing case insensitivity in the comparison of table names extracted from `stdout` and the input table name, the corrected function will pass the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub. This fix ensures that the function behaves consistently regardless of the case of the table names.
