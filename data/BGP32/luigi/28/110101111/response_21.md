## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in Hive. The bug occurs when the function compares the table name with the output from Hive, causing case sensitivity issues.
2. The bug is causing the tests to fail, particularly when dealing with tables that have different cases in their names.
3. The bug is related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons. The function does not handle case differences between the table name provided and the output from Hive, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
4. A strategy to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This would ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.

## Updated Function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the corrected function addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue. This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, leading to correct results when checking for table existence in Hive.

The updated function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the reported bug.
