Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from `stdout` to the provided table name. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue. This correction should make the function pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
