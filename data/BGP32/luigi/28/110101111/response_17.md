To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue when comparing the `table` name with the output `stdout` obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should handle case-insensitive comparisons to ensure correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table` parameter is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` to handle case sensitivity.
- The comparison is now case-insensitive, ensuring that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.
- The function returns `True` when `stdout` is not empty (`bool(stdout)`) to indicate the table exists.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue of case sensitivity mentioned in the GitHub issue #896.
