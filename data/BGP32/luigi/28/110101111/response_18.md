## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is responsible for determining if a table exists in Hive.
2. The function has a bug where it is not handling case sensitivity when checking the existence of a table, leading to failing tests.
3. The failing test cases show that the function fails to correctly identify existing tables due to case sensitivity issues. The expected output of the function should consider case-insensitive table existence checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting them to lowercase before comparison.
5. By addressing the case sensitivity issue in the function, we can ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of tables regardless of case differences.

## Bug Fix
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the check case-insensitive. This modification ensures that the function behaves as expected, passing the failing tests and addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
