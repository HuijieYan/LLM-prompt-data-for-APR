After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it's evident that the issue lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command, which is case-sensitive. To resolve the problem and make the function case-insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider the lowercase versions of both strings.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to check `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive and will correctly identify the table's existence regardless of the case. This change aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue #896.

This modified function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
