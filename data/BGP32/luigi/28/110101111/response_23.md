In the buggy function provided, the `table_exists` method is failing due to case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the `stdout` result from the Hive query. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them in a case-insensitive manner.
- We update the return statement to directly return the result of `bool(stdout)` for the partitioned case.

This correction will ensure that the `table_exists` method correctly handles case sensitivity issues and passes the failing tests. It aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue #896 to make the comparison case insensitive.
