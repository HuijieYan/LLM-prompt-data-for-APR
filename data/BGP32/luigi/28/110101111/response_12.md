Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of Hive tables. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                 (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the bug and enabling the function to return the correct results for the test cases provided.
