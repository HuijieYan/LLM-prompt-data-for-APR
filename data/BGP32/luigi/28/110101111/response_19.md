Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive output. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` outputs to lowercase, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by case discrepancies. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
