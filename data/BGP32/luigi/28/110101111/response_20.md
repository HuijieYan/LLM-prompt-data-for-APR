### Identify the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly to the output from the Hive command without considering the case of the table names.

### Explanation of the Bug:
In the failing test cases, the function `table_exists` is expected to be case-insensitive when checking if a table exists. However, the current implementation compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without any case transformation, leading to false negatives for tables with different cases.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function has been updated to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

By making this change, the function will now correctly identify table existence regardless of the case of the table name, resolving the failing tests and addressing the GitHub issue regarding case insensitivity.
