To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure case-insensitive matching.

This fix ensures that the buggy function passes the failing test cases provided and addresses the issue raised in GitHub related to making `table_exists` case-insensitive.
