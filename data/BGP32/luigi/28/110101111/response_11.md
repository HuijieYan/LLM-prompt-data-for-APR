The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity in checking for table existence. The function is returning false positives/negatives when comparing tables due to case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" 
                              % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. The comparison is now case insensitive, fixing the bug related to table comparisons in the `table_exists` function.
