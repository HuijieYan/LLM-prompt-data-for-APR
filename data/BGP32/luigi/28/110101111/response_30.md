To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the function can correctly identify if a table exists regardless of case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, this function will now correctly evaluate if a table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided. Additionally, it addresses the issue raised on GitHub about making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
