The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout` output. The issue highlighted in the GitHub report suggests that the comparison should be case insensitive to handle situations where table names might be provided in different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table names in the `stdout` output to be case insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle different variations in table names.
