## Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database using a Hive command invocation.
2. The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command is case-sensitive, leading to test failures in scenarios where the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name returned by Hive.
3. The failing test cases provide different scenarios where the buggy function fails to handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to incorrect results in comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function will address the case-insensitivity issue and ensure that the tests pass as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure case-insensitive matching.
- This modification addresses the issue of case sensitivity highlighted in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
- The corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior of case-insensitive table existence checks.
