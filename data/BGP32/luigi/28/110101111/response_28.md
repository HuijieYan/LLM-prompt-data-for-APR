The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command not being case insensitive, leading to test failures when the case of the table name does not match the output. To fix this issue, we need to perform a case insensitive match between the table name and the output.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output, ensuring that the test cases pass and addresses the GitHub issue reported.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly check for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug identified in the failing tests and GitHub issue.
