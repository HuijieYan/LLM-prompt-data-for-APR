After analyzing the buggy function and its failing test cases, it is clear that the issue lies in the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison should also be case-insensitive to avoid failures.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this change, the table name and the output will be compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the test failures and aligning with the GitHub issue's proposed solution.

After implementing this corrected version, the failing tests should pass successfully without any issues.
