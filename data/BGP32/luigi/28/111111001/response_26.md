### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic. The function expects the `run_hive_cmd` function to return the table names, and then it checks if the input table is in the output. However, the check is incorrect, leading to the failing test cases.

1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function returns `True` when it should return `False` since the table name 'mytable' is not present in the output 'OK'.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the function should return `True` since the table name 'mytable' is present in the output 'OK\nmytable', but it actually returns `False`.

The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the stdout value in the comparison process.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where the function checks if the table name is in the output. Instead of just checking if the table name is present in the output, we should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name is in the list of table names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function after correction
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking if the table name is in the resulting list, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
