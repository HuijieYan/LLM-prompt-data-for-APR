### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` value returned by `run_hive_cmd`. The function is checking if the `table` is in `stdout`, but the comparison is not handling the cases where the `table` name matches partially with other strings in `stdout` leading to incorrect results. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure an exact match between the `table` name and the values in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

In the corrected version, I added `.split('\n')` after `stdout` to split the output into individual lines before checking if the `table` is in the list of tables in the `stdout`. This modification ensures that the comparison is done accurately with each table name in `stdout`. 

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests by accurately identifying whether the table exists or not in the Hive database.
