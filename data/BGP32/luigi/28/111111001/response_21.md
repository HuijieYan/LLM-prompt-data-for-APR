The issue in the buggy function `table_exists` lies in the condition checking for the table existence. The function is not correctly handling the case where the table name is in the stdout but in a different case (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable'). The comparison should be case-insensitive to support varying cases in the table name.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the function will now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug identified in the failing tests. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
