The bug in the `table_exists` function is potentially related to how the stdout is checked to determine if the table exists. The `stdout` variable is checked for truthiness and if the `table` is in it. However, in the failing test cases, the values of `stdout` do not match the expected results, leading to assertion errors.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition where we check if the `table` is in the `stdout` to properly handle cases where `stdout` contains more than just the table name. One possible approach is to split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the `table` is in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # if stdout has any content, treat as True
``` 

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the cases where `stdout` contains multiple lines and the table name is not the only content present. This should resolve the assertion errors encountered in the failing test cases.
