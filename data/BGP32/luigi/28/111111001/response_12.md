### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the case where the table name might be present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function along with other content. The function is checking if the entire output contains only the table name, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is checking for an exact match of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the failing test cases, the output contains the table name along with other content separated by a newline, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should split the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines. This approach will ensure that the function identifies the table correctly even if it is present among multiple entries in the output.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking if the `table` is present in any of the lines, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
