### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the provided `table` value. The comparison logic might not be handling the output correctly.
3. In the failing tests, we can see that the comparisons are failing at the assertion because the expected results are not being received from the `table_exists` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` value is done correctly, taking into account potential whitespace or formatting issues.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should handle the checking of table existence with partitions correctly and pass the failing test cases.
