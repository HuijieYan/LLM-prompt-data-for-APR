### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. In the correct logic, it should check if the table name exactly matches one of the lines in the `stdout`, but the current implementation only checks for the presence of the table name anywhere within the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the check for table existence to ensure that the table name exactly matches one of the lines in the `stdout`. This will provide the correct behavior and make the function pass the failing tests. Additionally, we need to adjust the string comparison to handle both upper and lower case table names to match the test case insensitivity requirement.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and any(line.strip().lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` by lines and compare each line (after stripping whitespace) with the provided table name (both converted to lowercase) to check for an exact match.
- We use the `any` function to iterate over the lines and return `True` if a match is found.
- We return `True` directly if `stdout` is not empty when checking partition existence.
