### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing tests because the function is not correctly handling the case insensitivity of table names. The function checks for the existence of a table in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it does so without considering the case sensitivity of the table name. As a result, when the function receives a table name in a different case than what is returned in the `stdout`, the comparison fails, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
