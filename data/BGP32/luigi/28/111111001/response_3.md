### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking when the function is called with a table name that exists in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is faulty because even though the `table in stdout` part correctly checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout`, the `stdout` itself might be empty (if the table doesn't exist) which causes the condition to evaluate to `False` when it should return `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because of the way the condition is structured in the `table_exists` function. When the `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty `stdout` (indicating that the table doesn't exist), the current condition doesn't handle this case correctly and returns `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `stdout` is not empty before checking if the `table` exists in it. This way, we ensure that even when no tables match the pattern in `stdout`, the condition evaluates correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By checking `bool(stdout)` directly we ensure that an empty `stdout` will return `False` as expected, fixing the bug.
