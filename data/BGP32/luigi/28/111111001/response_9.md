### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The function is currently returning `True` if `stdout` is not empty and the table name is in it. However, in the failing test cases, the `stdout` variable contains other information along with the table name, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 2 and Case 4, the `stdout` variable contains additional information along with the table name, causing the function to incorrectly return `True`.
2. The current logic of checking if the table name is in `stdout` is too lenient, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly identify if the table name exists in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should only consider the table name if it appears as a standalone word in the output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Check if the table name appears as a standalone word in the `stdout` by splitting the output by lines and comparing strip-ed lines with the table name.
2. Modified the query in the else block to correctly include the database, table, and partition for the `run_hive_cmd`.

With these changes, the function should now correctly identify the existence of a table in the `stdout` output, passing the failing test cases.
