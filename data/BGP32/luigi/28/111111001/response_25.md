### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic. In the provided function, the check for the existence of a table is incorrect, leading to failing tests. The function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is not a reliable method since the output might contain other unwanted information along with the table name. This leads to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly returns `True` because the table name 'mytable' is found in the output 'OK', which is not accurate.

2. In Case 2, the function incorrectly returns `False` due to the case sensitivity of the table name comparison.

3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False` since the provided table name 'mytable' is not found in the output 'OK'.

4. In Case 4, the function incorrectly returns `False` due to the case sensitivity of the table name comparison.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the table existence check logic. Instead of just checking if the table name is in the output string, it would be more reliable to split the output lines and check if the table name is an exact match with any line in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(tbl.strip() == table for tbl in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
                                
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(partition.strip() == self.partition_spec(partition) for partition in partitions)
```

By splitting the output lines and comparing each line individually to the provided table name, we ensure a more accurate check for the existence of the table, fixing the bug and enabling the function to pass the failing tests.
