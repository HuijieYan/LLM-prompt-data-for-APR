The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is in the conditional check for the existence of the table after running the hive command. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when the table is not present in the output of the command.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the faulty logic in the conditional check for the table existence. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout output of the hive command but fails to handle cases where the table name might be part of another string.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that the table name appears as a whole word in the stdout output. This can be achieved by splitting the stdout into lines and then checking if any line exactly matches the table name.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the conditional check to compare each line in the stdout with the table name, we ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of the table. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
