Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue lies in the condition check in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the table name is in the output obtained from running a Hive command, but the comparison is not taking into account the case sensitivity of the table names. This results in the function returning incorrect values in certain scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive when checking if the table name is present in the output. One way to achieve this is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue identified in the failing test cases.
