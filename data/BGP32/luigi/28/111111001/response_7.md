### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` fails because the condition to check if the table exists is flawed. When the function receives the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function, it checks whether the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, the buggy implementation does not properly handle the case where the table names in the `stdout` are not exact matches, leading to failing test cases where the table name case differs.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
2. The buggy function does not properly handle the case where the table name does not exactly match the expected input.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison of the table names is done in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` name and the names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the `table` and the names in the `stdout` to lowercase when checking for existence, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and should now pass the failing test cases.
