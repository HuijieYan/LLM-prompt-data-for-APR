### Bug analysis:
The issue lies in the condition checking in the `table_exists` function. The function checks whether the table is found in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but the comparison is not accurate due to the formatting of the output. The buggy function is expecting an exact match of the table name in the output, but the output includes both the table name and additional characters or newlines.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly check for the presence of the table name in the output. This can be achieved by splitting the output into lines and checking if the table name appears in any of the lines.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly check for the presence of the table name in the output, and the corrected version should pass the failing tests.
