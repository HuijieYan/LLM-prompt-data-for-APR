### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command. The issue lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which can cause failures due to case sensitivity.

The related function `run_hive_cmd` is used to execute Hive commands in the `HiveCommandClient` class.

The failing test cases check the behavior of the `table_exists` function with different input values and expected outcomes. The failing test asserts the existence of a table, but due to case sensitivity issues, the function returns an incorrect result.

### Identifying potential error locations

The bug is likely caused by the direct comparison between the `table` parameter and the output `stdout` from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

### Explanation of the bug

- In the failing test cases, the output from the Hive command is not being efficiently compared with the table name due to case sensitivity issues.
- The buggy function directly checks if the given table name is present in the output of the Hive command, which can fail when the case does not match.
- The failing tests reveal that the function does not handle case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, you can modify the comparison logic between the table name and the output from the Hive command. Converting both strings to lowercase before comparison can resolve the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected version of the function

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that handles case insensitivity:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- This modification will address the case sensitivity issue identified in the failing test cases.

By implementing this correction, the `table_exists` function should now return the correct results in all test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity.
