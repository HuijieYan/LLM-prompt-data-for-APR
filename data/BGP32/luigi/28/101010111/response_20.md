### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The bug arises from case sensitivity issues where the table name is compared without converting to lowercase.
2. The error occurs when the `table_exists` function is called with different table names (some capitalized and some not) and the assertions in the test fail due to case sensitivity.
3. The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name and the table names retrieved from the outputs without converting them to the same case. This leads to false negatives in the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the names retrieved from `stdout` are converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparisons.
5. The fixed function below includes converting both the `table` and the retrieved table names to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the table names retrieved from the output to lowercase, the function now correctly performs case-insensitive comparisons and ensures the test cases pass.
