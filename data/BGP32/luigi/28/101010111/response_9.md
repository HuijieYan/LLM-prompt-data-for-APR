### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The function is comparing the table name against the stdout without considering case differences, leading to test failures.
2. The issue is related to the comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity.
3. The error messages indicate that the test cases are failing due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the expected table names with the actual output from stdout.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive by converting both table names and stdout to lowercase before comparison.
5. The suggested strategy to fix the bug is to modify the comparisons in the `table_exists` function to use lowercase versions of the table names and the stdout.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert both to lowercase for case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that case sensitivity issues are addressed, passing the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output values mentioned for the relevant test cases.
