## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue arises when comparing the table name in the command output. The failing tests are indicating that the function is case-sensitive and does not correctly match the table name in the output.

The expected behavior is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.

## Bug Location

The bug is located in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable in the `table_exists` function. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when table names have different cases.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug occurs due to the function comparing the exact table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case differences. When the table names have a different case in the command output, the comparison fails, leading to test failures.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the command output is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. By doing so, we can accurately check for table existence in Hive irrespective of the case of the table names.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` variables are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the table existence check case insensitive.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing tests and correctly handle table name comparisons in Hive.
