### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in Hive based on the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises when the table names are compared without considering case sensitivity.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to assertion failures in the test cases.
3. The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name directly with the `stdout`, which may contain a different case due to Hive being case-insensitive. The bug results in assertion errors due to incorrect comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. This change will make the comparison case-insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)

# Explanation:
# - The corrected function converts both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparison, making it case-insensitive.
# - In the case where a partition is specified, the correction simplifies the return statement to directly check the truthiness of stdout.
```

With this correction, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
