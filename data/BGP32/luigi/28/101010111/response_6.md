### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute commands in Hive. The function is designed to check if a table exists in the given database using Hive.
2. The failing test cases are checking for the existence of tables with different cases (e.g., `mytable` and `MyTable`). The bug arises because the function is case-sensitive when checking if the table exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, which may not match due to case differences. This leads to failing test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
5. The fix involves modifying the return statements to use case-insensitive comparisons.

### Updated Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly identifies the table's existence without considering the case. This fix addresses the failing test cases and aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
