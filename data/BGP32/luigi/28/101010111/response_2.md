### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the tables listed in the Hive output. The buggy function does a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures due to case mismatches.

### Identifying potential error locations
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The comparison between the table name and the tables in the Hive output is case sensitive.
2. The function does not account for case sensitivity when performing the comparison.

### Explaining the bug
The bug arises from the direct comparison between the table name and the tables obtained from the Hive output. If the table names in the Hive output are in a different case than the one provided, the comparison fails even though the table exists. This issue was highlighted in GitHub issue #896.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables in the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables in the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function's behavior becomes case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue. This correction should address the failing tests and improve the function's reliability.
