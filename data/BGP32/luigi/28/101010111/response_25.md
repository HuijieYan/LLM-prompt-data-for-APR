### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. The issue arises when the function checks for table existence where case sensitivity can be problematic.
2. The main issue causing the test failures is the case sensitivity when checking the table name against the stdout output.
3. The buggy function compares the table name directly with the output from the command. However, due to case sensitivity in Hive, this comparison fails when the table names have different cases. The test cases are failing because the checks are not case-insensitive, leading to incorrect assertions.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case-insensitive.
5. The suggested fix involves converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` function. This ensures a case-insensitive check for the table existence.
- The first `if` block in the `table_exists` function now compares `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` instead of `table in stdout`.
- The second `if` block in the function only checks the truthiness of `stdout`. It is modified for clarity and simplicity.
- This correction aligns with the suggested fix strategy and should address the failing test cases related to case sensitivity issues.
