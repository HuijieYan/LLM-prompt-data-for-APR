### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the table existence in Hive and returning a boolean value based on the presence of the table in the output.
2. The bug is causing the function to fail for table names with different cases due to a case sensitivity issue.
3. The failing test cases provide the expected input values and the corresponding stdout that the function should handle correctly. The test cases clearly show that the function is failing when dealing with different cases of table names.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to make the check case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` is comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command without considering the case sensitivity of the table names. This leads to incorrect results when table names are provided with different cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This approach will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function behaves correctly for table names with different cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the check for table existence is case insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the function behave correctly for all table name cases.
