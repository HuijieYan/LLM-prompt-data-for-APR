### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, it has a bug related to case sensitivity.
2. The bug arises when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to case-related assertion errors in the test cases.
3. The bug occurs because the function does a direct case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, without considering case-insensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase or uppercase before comparing them.
5. The correction involves modifying the comparison condition to ensure case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercase values of both the table name and the output, the function now supports case-insensitive comparisons, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
