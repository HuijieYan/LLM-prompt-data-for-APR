### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running specific Hive commands.
2. The error occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands, leading to case sensitivity issues.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function fails when the table names are not in the same case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
