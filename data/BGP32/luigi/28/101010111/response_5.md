### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. However, it has a case sensitivity issue where it directly compares the table name from the stdout without considering case differences.
2. The failing test cases provide different scenarios where the expected table name's case is not matched with the actual case in the output.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for case sensitivity in table existence check, leading to assertion errors in the tests.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner before returning the result.
5. The corrected version of the function should convert both table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the entries in `stdout` are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly in scenarios where table name cases differ.
