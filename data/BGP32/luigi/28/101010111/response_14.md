### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands like `show tables` or `show partitions`.
2. The failing tests are asserting that the function should return `True` when the table exists in Hive, but due to case sensitivity issues, the tests fail.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not consider case sensitivity when checking if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Ignore the implementation of partition_spec for now

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. The corrected function now matches the expected behavior and resolves the failing tests.
