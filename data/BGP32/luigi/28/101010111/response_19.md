### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when the case sensitivity of the table name is not handled properly.
2. The failing test cases expect the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function is not converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout, leading to failures in case-insensitive comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is converted to lowercase before checking its presence in the stdout.
5. The correction involves converting the table name to lowercase before comparison in both cases of the function.

### Solution:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles the case sensitivity issue properly. This solution addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves as expected in all test cases.
