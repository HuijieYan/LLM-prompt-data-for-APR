Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function does not handle the case where the table names may have different casing in Hive compared to what is provided as input. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.lower() == "OK"

```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase using the `lower()` function before checking for the table's existence, making the comparison case insensitive.
- In the `else` block, we compare the lowercase `stdout` value with `"OK"` directly to ensure the partition exists.

By applying these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and handle case sensitivity issues as reported in the GitHub issues #896 and #899.
