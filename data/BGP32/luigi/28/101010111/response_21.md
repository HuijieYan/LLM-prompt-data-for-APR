### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is a method in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with different queries based on the presence of a partition.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly.
4. The expected behavior is to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when comparing the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not converting the table name to lowercase when comparing it with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to case sensitivity issues and failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and handle the case sensitivity issue as described in the GitHub issue.
