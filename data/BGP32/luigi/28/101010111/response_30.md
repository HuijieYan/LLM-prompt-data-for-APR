### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity in checking table names against the output from the Hive command. The test cases involve checking table existence based on different inputs and expected outputs.

### Error Cause:
The issue arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command is case sensitive. The function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison to resolve this problem.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout received.
2. Lowercase both the table name and the stdout before the comparison to make it case insensitive.

### Code Fix:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout received from the Hive commands, ensuring that the test cases pass successfully.
