### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, with or without partition specifications.
2. The bug occurs when the function compares the table name without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures.
3. The issue on GitHub (#896) highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `table_exists` incorrectly checks for table existence by performing a direct comparison between the table name and the stdout from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failures in test cases when the case of the table names differs between the function input and the derived stdout. The expected behavior is to make the comparison case-insensitive to account for variations in table naming conventions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function to return `True` when the table is found (case-insensitive) in the stdout, and `False` otherwise.
3. Apply the suggested approach from the GitHub issue (#896) to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

from typing import Optional

# Modify the run_hive_cmd function if necessary

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table: str, database: str = 'default', partition: Optional[dict] = None) -> bool:
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the corrected `table_exists` function will compare both the table name and the stdout in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the test failures and aligning with the request in the GitHub issue.
