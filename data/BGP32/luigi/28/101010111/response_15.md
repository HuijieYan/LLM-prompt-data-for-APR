### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises due to case sensitivity in comparing the table name.
2. The error message indicates that the test case fails when trying to assert `True` for a table that should exist but fails due to case sensitivity.
3. The bug is caused by not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The function retrieves table names from Hive in lowercase, causing a mismatch during comparison. The expected values are not being handled correctly.
4. To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparing.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function `table_exists`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, this version of the function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence. The corrected function should now pass all the failing tests and address the issue raised on GitHub.
