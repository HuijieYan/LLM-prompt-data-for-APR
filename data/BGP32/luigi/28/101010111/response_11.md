### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file checks if a table exists in a database.
2. The function makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The failing test cases indicate that table existence check is case sensitive, causing assertion errors.
4. The expected input/output values for the failing test cases have been provided.
5. The related GitHub issue (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing `stdout` against lowercase table names.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The buggy function compares the `table` name directly with the `stdout`, leading to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function does not convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

### Cause of the bug:
1. When checking for table existence, the buggy function compares the `table` name as is with the `stdout`, which results in case sensitivity issues.
2. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should compare the lowercase version of both `table` and `stdout` to avoid these problems.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Corrected version of the function `table_exists`:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
