Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in Hive. To fix this bug and make the function case insensitive, we need to compare the table name in lowercase with the output of the Hive command also converted to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction in place, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name and the output from Hive in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before the comparison. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug #896, making the function more robust and avoiding failures due to case mismatch in table names.

Please ensure to test the corrected function with the provided test cases to confirm that it now passes and behaves as expected in a case-insensitive manner.
