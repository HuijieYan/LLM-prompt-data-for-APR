Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issues related to this bug, the cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a direct comparison between the table name provided and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which can lead to case sensitivity issues. The expected behavior should be case-insensitive table existence check.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we make the table existence check case-insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior of a case-insensitive table existence check.
