Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue stems from the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. The existing implementation does a direct comparison, which can lead to false results due to case differences.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive. This updated version should pass all the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
