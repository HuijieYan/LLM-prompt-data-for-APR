### Analyzing the buggy function and related functions

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a given table exists in a specified database using a particular partition. The function makes a call to the `run_hive_cmd` function which executes Hive commands and returns the output. The failing tests indicate an issue with case sensitivity during table existence checks.

The failing test cases expect the function to be case insensitive when comparing table names in the output. The bug needs to be addressed by modifying how the comparison is done between the table name and the output.

### Identifying potential error locations

The error is likely originating from the comparison logic within the `table_exists` function. Specifically, the conditional checks that compare the table name with the stdout from the Hive command execution could be causing the issue.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug arises from the fact that the function does a direct string comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command, without considering case sensitivity. When the table name and the name in the output have different cases, the comparison fails, leading to the failing test cases.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive when checking if the table name exists in the output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the function case insensitive. This change addresses the issue raised in the failing test cases.
