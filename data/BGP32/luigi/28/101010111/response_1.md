### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expected to check if a table exists in a database. However, the issue arises with the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The failing test cases indicate the discrepancy between the expected and actual behaviors of the function.
2. The bug occurs due to the mismatch in case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The failing test cases show that the function fails to correctly identify tables due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity when comparing the table name and the output from Hive.
5. A corrected version of the function will compare the lowercase of both the table name and the stdout to handle case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made
1. Lowercased both the `table` and `stdout` before comparison to achieve case insensitivity.
2. Removed the unnecessary if-else condition and simplified the return statement.

By making these changes, the corrected function will now handle case sensitivity issues properly and pass the failing test cases.
