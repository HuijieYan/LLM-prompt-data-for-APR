Based on the provided information, here is the analysis, explanation of the bug, and the corrected version of the buggy function:

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class, which checks whether a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function executes a Hive command based on the input parameters and expects specific outputs to determine the existence of the table.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.
4. The expected output values and types in different scenarios are provided for reference.

### Explanation of Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function does not handle case variations correctly, leading to assertion errors in the test cases. The failing tests demonstrate the inconsistency in handling case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output is case insensitive. By converting both to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we can eliminate the case sensitivity issue and make the function consistent in its behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the comparisons to use lowercase representations of the table name and the Hive command output. This change ensures case insensitivity in the comparison.
2. Replaced `table in stdout` with `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for case-insensitive checking.
3. Refactored the `if-else` block to ensure consistent return statements based on the stdout output.

By implementing the above corrections, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases as per the expected input/output values.
