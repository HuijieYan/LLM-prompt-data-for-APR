### Analyzing the buggy function
The `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to potential failures when comparing table names.

### Error location and cause of the bug
The bug arises from the comparison between the table name provided and the output from the Hive command, which may have different case formats. The issue on GitHub highlights this problem, indicating that Hive is case-insensitive, leading to inconsistencies in table names returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function
Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub.
