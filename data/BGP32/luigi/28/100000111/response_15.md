The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has an issue where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence in Hive. When comparing the table name with the table names listed in Hive, it does not take into account case insensitivity. This causes failures when the table names differ in case.

To resolve this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in Hive to use lowercase comparisons. We will also update the `return` statement accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fixed version ensures that both the table name and the tables listed in Hive are converted to lowercase for comparison, making the function case insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue.

By making this adjustment, the function should now accurately determine the existence of tables in Hive while handling case sensitivity correctly as described in the provided tests and GitHub issues.
