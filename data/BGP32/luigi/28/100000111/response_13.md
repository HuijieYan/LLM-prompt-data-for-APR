The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output of Hive commands, leading to test failures due to mismatched casing.

To address this issue, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison in the `return` statement, we ensure a case-insensitive check, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
