### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from the Hive command. The GitHub issue suggests that the function should be case insensitive to avoid issues related to table name casing.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case sensitive.
2. The comparison `return True` or `return False` is based on the existence of the partition, not the table itself.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to fail when comparing table names due to case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results. This is highlighted in the GitHub issue where tables defined with capitalized names are returned as lowercase by Hive, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database. Additionally, we should ensure that the function correctly determines if a table exists based on the output from the Hive command.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if any(table.lower() in p.lower() for p in stdout.splitlines()):
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation
In the corrected version:
- Check if the lowercased `table` is in the lowercased list of tables returned from Hive.
- Check if the lowercased `table` is in any partition returned from Hive.
- Use the `splitlines()` method to process multiple table names and partitions.

By making the comparisons case insensitive and adjusting the logic to correctly determine the existence of tables and partitions, the function should now work as expected and address the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
