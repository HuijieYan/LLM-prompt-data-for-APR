The buggy function `table_exists` in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file is facing an issue where the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` result is case-sensitive. This causes problems when the table names are in different cases than what is returned by Hive, resulting in test failures.

The buggy function is structured in a way that directly compares the `table` variable with the `stdout` result without considering the case sensitivity issue.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` variable and the `stdout` result to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case-insensitive and will work correctly for tables with different cases.
