The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking table existence in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the problem where capitalized table names are compared to lowercase table names returned by Hive, causing the tests to fail.

The bug occurs when comparing the `table` parameter with the `stdout` output from Hive, leading to case mismatch issues. To fix this bug, the comparison should be case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version converts both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.
