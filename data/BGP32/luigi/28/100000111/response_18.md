The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file needs to be fixed to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function fails when dealing with tables that are defined with capitalized names due to Hive's case insensitivity.

### Bug Analysis:
The bug arises from the function comparing the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, which may not match due to case differences. The function needs to account for case insensitivity while checking for table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparing them. This way, case differences will not cause the function to fail.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the function will now handle case insensitivity correctly. This will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function works as expected in all cases.
