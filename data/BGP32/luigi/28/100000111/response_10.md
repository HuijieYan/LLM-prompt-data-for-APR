### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not correctly handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The expected behavior is that the function should be case insensitive when comparing table names.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names.
2. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing with the `stdout`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names. However, the function `table_exists` does not take this into account, leading to potential failures in the tests or operations where case sensitivity matters. The function compares the table names directly without converting them to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them to ensure case insensitivity. By doing so, we can align the behavior of the function with the case insensitivity of Hive.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Corrected function to make table_exists case insensitive
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function. This modification ensures a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables listed in Hive. This fix aligns with the expected behavior in the GitHub issue and addresses the case sensitivity problem reported.
