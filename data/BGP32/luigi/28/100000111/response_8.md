### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has two main branches based on whether the `partition` parameter is `None` or not. In both branches, the function executes a Hive command and checks the output to determine if the table exists. However, the bug arises from case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name to the output. The function does not handle case insensitivity in table name comparisons, leading to failures when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison of the `table` with the output `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug has been identified due to the case sensitivity issue in table name comparisons. When the table names provided as input do not match exactly with the case in the Hive output, the function incorrectly determines the table's existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name with the stdout to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function as above, we ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the `table_exists` function more robust against case sensitivity problems in table name checks.
