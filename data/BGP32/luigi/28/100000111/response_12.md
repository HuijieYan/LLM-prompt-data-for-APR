### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file needs to be fixed to handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. Currently, it compares the table name directly with the stdout, which can lead to failures due to case sensitivity in table names.

### Identified Error
The buggy function fails to account for case sensitivity as mentioned in the GitHub issue. It directly compares the table name with the stdout, leading to potential failures when the case of the table names does not match.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the direct comparison of the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. When the table name's case does not match the case of the stdout, the function incorrectly determines table existence, leading to failures in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison. This way, we ensure case insensitivity and accurately determine table existence based on the case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This modification aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make the table existence check case insensitive. Now, the function will accurately determine the existence of tables in Hive regardless of the case of the table names.
