### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, there is a case sensitivity issue where the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command without considering case differences. This leads to incorrect results when the table names are in different cases.

1. When no partition is specified, the function runs a Hive command to show tables and checks if the desired table exists based on the command's output.
2. When a partition is specified, the function shows partitions for the given table and partition, then checks if the partitions exist based on the command's output.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the comparison between the desired table name and the output of the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table names returned by the commands may be in a different case than the input table name, leading to false negatives in the function's logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the desired table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
``` 

In the corrected version, before comparing the table names, both the `table` and the values in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This modification addresses the issue identified in the GitHub links provided.
