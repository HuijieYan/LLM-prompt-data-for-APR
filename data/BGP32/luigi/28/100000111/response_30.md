### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking if a table or partition exists in a Hive database.
- The function uses stdout from running Hive commands to determine if the table/partition exists.
- The bug arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output from Hive commands.

### Errors:
- The function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output.
- The comparison between `table` and `stdout` does not take into account case differences, leading to potential mismatches.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from Hive commands.
- Hive is case insensitive and may return table names in lowercase, causing mismatches during comparison.

### Solution:
- To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles the case insensitivity issue as raised in the GitHub issue.
