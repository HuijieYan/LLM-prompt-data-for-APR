Potential Error Locations:
1. In the first branch of the if-else statement, the comparison between the table name and stdout might not be case insensitive.
2. The second branch of the if-else statement might not handle case insensitivity properly.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the function's table existence check is case sensitive, while Hive itself is case insensitive. Hence, when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command, the case difference causes failures in the test cases.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
