### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it directly compares the table name in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. This bug leads to failing test cases when the table names have different cases. The GitHub issue highlights the necessity to make `table_exists` case insensitive for table name comparisons in Hive.

### Error locations
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity while comparing table names from the `stdout`.
2. In the else block, the function returns True if `stdout` is not empty, which doesn't consider the case sensitivity issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the direct comparison of table names in the `stdout` without considering the case sensitivity of the names. Hive is case insensitive, but Python's direct string comparison is case sensitive, leading to test failures when table names have different cases than expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
- Update the function to convert both the table name and the output from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
- Modify the return statements to use case-insensitive comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring case-insensitive checks for table existence in Hive.
