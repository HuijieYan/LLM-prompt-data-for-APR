### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not check for case insensitivity when comparing table names. This leads to issues when checking for table existence in Hive due to discrepancies in capitalization.

### Error Locations:
1. In the first condition, the function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` but does not consider case sensitivity.
2. In the second condition with partition, the similar case sensitivity issue is present.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the `table` name without converting it to lowercase. Hive is case-insensitive, so the table names returned by Hive might be in lowercase. As a result, the function fails to recognize the table's existence when the capitalization does not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This way, we can ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that the table existence check is case-insensitive and aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
