### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the provided code snippet is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a database, with an option to provide a partition. The bug arises from the fact that it does a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which leads to test failures when the table name casing does not match the actual table casing in the database.

### Identified Issue
The issue lies in the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value obtained from the Hive command output. The comparison is being done without considering the case sensitivity, leading to test failures as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug originates from the fact that the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value are not being transformed to a consistent case (either lower case or upper case) before comparison. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should consider the case-insensitive nature of the database.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to transform both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value to a consistent case (either lower case or upper case) before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, aligning with the behavior of Hive. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the function, both the `table` and `stdout` values are transformed to lowercase before the comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
