### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it doesn't handle case sensitivity properly. The function compares the table name with the output from Hive, leading to failures when there are case differences.

### Error Locations
1. The comparison `table in stdout` does not account for case differences.
2. The comparison `self.partition_spec(partition)` is not being handled correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function directly compares the table name to the Hive output without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the table names are in different cases (capitalized vs. lower case).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, I have converted both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is now case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
