1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database in Hive, optionally with a specified partition. The bug revolves around case sensitivity when matching the table name with the output.
   - The provided GitHub issue indicates that the table names in Hive may return as lowercase even if defined in a different case. The current implementation does not handle this case sensitivity issue.

2. **Error Locations**:
   - The bug lies in how the function compares the table name with the output from the Hive query when checking table existence.
   
3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The bug occurs due to a mismatch in case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may return in lowercase, causing the function to fail in matching.
   
4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison. This modification will align with the expected behavior as discussed in the GitHub issue.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from the Hive query are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case-insensitive. This modification aligns with the expectation described in the GitHub issue, addressing the case sensitivity problem.
