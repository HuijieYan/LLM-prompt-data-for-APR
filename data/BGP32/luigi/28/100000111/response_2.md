**Analysis:**

The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database. However, the issue arises when checking for table existence without considering case sensitivity. The provided cases expect the function to handle both case-sensitive and case-insensitive scenarios.

**Error:**

The bug occurs due to the strict comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive commands, which can differ in case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results and test failures.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

**Updated Corrected Function:**
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function considering the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

This corrected version ensures that the table name and the output from Hive commands are compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub threads.
