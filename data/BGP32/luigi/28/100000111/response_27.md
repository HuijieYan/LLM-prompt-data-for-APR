### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-sensitive, leading to failures when table names have different case variations. The bug needs to be fixed by performing case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the provided function, the variable `table` is being compared directly with the output stored in `stdout`, which can lead to issues due to case sensitivity.
2. The GitHub issue highlights the problem, where table names in Hive are case-insensitive, causing failures in tests when comparing table names.
3. To address the issue, the comparison needs to be made case-insensitive to handle different case variations of table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison in the function to be case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Use the `lower()` method to convert strings to lowercase for comparison to ensure case-insensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### The corrected function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
