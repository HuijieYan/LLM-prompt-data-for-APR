### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it does not compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This causes issues when checking for table existence in cases where the table names have different casing. The function should be adjusted to compare table names in a case-insensitive way.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the comparison step where `table in stdout` is used without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing the table name directly with stdout without considering the case of the table name. This results in false negatives when the table names have different casing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison step to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, before comparing the table name with the output, both the table name and the output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This way, the comparison is more robust and ensures case-insensitive matching for table existence checks.
