### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The bug causes the function to fail when the table names have different cases than expected.

### Identified Error:
The bug arises in the comparison of table names within the `stdout` variable. The function fails to account for case sensitivity, resulting in incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the content of `stdout`, which may have a different case. This results in the function incorrectly returning `False` instead of `True` when the table exists but with a different case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout content to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function can correctly identify the table irrespective of the case used.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, we convert both the `table` and the `stdout` content to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` before comparing them.
- By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function can now accurately determine the existence of the table despite differences in case.
- The return statement simplifies to returning the boolean value of `stdout` in the case where a partition is specified.

### Conclusion:
The bug causing the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file to be case-sensitive has been resolved by making the comparison case-insensitive in the corrected version provided above. This fix ensures the function behaves as expected based on the inputs and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
