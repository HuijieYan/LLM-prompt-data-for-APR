### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing issues when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity. The function does not handle case insensitivity correctly, leading to failures in certain cases.

### Error Locations:
Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. Comparing `table` with `stdout` without handling case sensitivity.
2. Incorrectly parsing the partition specification in the else block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from a lack of case insensitivity handling in comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This leads to failures when the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now compares the lowercase versions of the table name and the output, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This fix addresses the reported issue of tables being defined in capitalized format causing failures in table existence checks.
