The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner. The function checks if the table name exists in the output from the Hive command without considering the case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results, especially when dealing with tables that have different capitalization styles.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table name in the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the table name comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This change addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion and ensures that the function behaves correctly in scenarios where table names may differ in capitalization.
