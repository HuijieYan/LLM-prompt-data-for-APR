The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive for table names. 

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable, which may cause failures due to case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when comparing the `table` name with the `stdout`, the function does not handle case insensitivity. This causes the function to fail when the table names have different case variations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to introduce case insensitivity in the comparison operation between the `table` and `stdout` variables. By converting both to lower or upper case before comparison, we can ensure that the function is case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the function now converts both the `table` and `stdout` variables to lower case before comparison, making the comparison case insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves correctly for all case variations of table names.
