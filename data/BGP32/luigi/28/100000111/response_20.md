### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has an issue with case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function currently checks for an exact match between the provided table name and the tables returned by Hive. However, Hive is case insensitive, so this approach leads to failures when the table names have different casings.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for Hive's case insensitivity, leading to test failures when table names are compared without considering casing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the tables returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result irrespective of the casing used in the table name.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Justification:
The corrected function now converts both the provided table name and the tables returned by Hive to lowercase before the comparison. This modification addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue, ensuring that the function behaves correctly in case-insensitive environments.
