## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`. In the first part of the condition, `return stdout and table in stdout`, the evaluation of the condition will be based on the truthiness of `stdout`, which may not be accurate. The correct approach should be to check if the table name is present in the `stdout`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to adjust the condition for checking if the table exists in the output of the hive command properly. Instead of relying on the truthiness of the `stdout`, we should check if the exact `table` name is present in the `stdout`.

## The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Convert the stdout to a boolean value

```
