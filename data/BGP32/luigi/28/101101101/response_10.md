The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the condition where it checks whether the `stdout` has any content for determining if a table exists. This check is insufficient since an "OK" response from the `run_hive_cmd` function can also be considered as content. The function should be modified to accurately parse the output to determine table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newlines, we can ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of the table in the output.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
