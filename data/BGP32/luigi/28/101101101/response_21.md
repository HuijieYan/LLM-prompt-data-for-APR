### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the incorrect comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. In the cases where `stdout` includes multiple table names, the buggy function wrongly checks if the `table` is exactly present in `stdout`. This results in a false negative when the `table` name is present among other table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the `table` name is present in the list of tables obtained from splitting. This way, we can ensure an accurate check for the existence of the specified `table`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, the function should now pass the failing tests and accurately determine the existence of the specified table in the Hive database.
