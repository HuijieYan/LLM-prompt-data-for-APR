### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it does not handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` properly. The function is checking for the presence of the table name in the stdout output, which is causing issues when the stdout contains other information as well.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the way the function checks for the table existence in the stdout output. The function directly checks if the table name is in the stdout without considering other information that might be present in the output. This approach leads to incorrect results in some cases.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function analyzes the stdout and verifies the existence of the table name more accurately. One way to improve this is to split the stdout into lines and then check if the table name is present in one of the lines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partitions))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to split the stdout by lines and then check for the table name in each line, we improve the accuracy of the table existence check. Additionally, we handle the partition information correctly in the second part of the function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
