### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the implementation of the conditional check for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` in the first part of the function does not correctly handle the case where 'table' is a substring of 'stdout'. This leads to incorrect results and the failing of the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the conditional check for the table presence in the `stdout` needs to be modified to ensure an exact match with the table name. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` by newlines and then checking if the exact table name is present in the list of tables.

### Corrected Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly identify the table existence based on exact table names present in the output.
