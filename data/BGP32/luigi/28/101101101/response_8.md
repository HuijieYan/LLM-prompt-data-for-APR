The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the faulty condition in the `if-else` statement. The bug occurs because the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` in the first block does not handle the case where the table name is a substring of an existing table name in `stdout`, leading to incorrect evaluation.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition in the first block to check for exact table name matches in `stdout` instead of substring matches. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters and then checking for an exact match of the table name. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters to create a list of existing tables in the database. It then directly checks if the given table name matches any of the existing table names in the list, ensuring an exact match.

By using this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle table existence checks.
