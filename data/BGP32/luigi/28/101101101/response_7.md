The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to how the function determines whether a table exists or not. It checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to see if the table name is present in the output. However, the current implementation does not account for cases where the table name might be part of another string in the output, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic of how we check for the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. Instead of a simple string search, we should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name is an exact match in the list of table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking for an exact match, we ensure that we are correctly identifying the existence of the table in the output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided. 
Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to verify that it now produces the expected results.
