### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of the table or partition. In the `if` block, the function checks if the `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` exists in it, but the logic is reversed. Similarly, in the `else` block, it checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine the existence of the partition, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logical conditions in the `if` and `else` blocks. The `if` block should check if the `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` exists in it to return `True`, and the `else` block should do the same for the partition existence.

### Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
```

By correcting the logical conditions, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
