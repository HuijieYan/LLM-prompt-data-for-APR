### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks if the table exists in the result obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug arises from the comparison `table in stdout`, which does not handle the case-sensitive nature of table names in Hive. This comparison fails when the case of the table name does not match exactly with the case in the stdout.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (either lowercase or uppercase) before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the difference in case.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles the case-insensitive nature of table names and should pass the failing test cases.
