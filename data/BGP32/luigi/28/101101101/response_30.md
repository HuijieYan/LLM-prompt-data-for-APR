### Bug in the Buggy Function
The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug in the logic where it checks if a table exists in a given database. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results in some cases, failing the provided test cases. The bug arises from how the function processes the stdout output from `run_hive_cmd` when checking for table existence.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function checks if the table exists by looking for an exact match of the table name in the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` command. In cases where the stdout contains multiple lines (e.g., when listing tables in the database), the function incorrectly matches only the table name without considering the entire line. This results in incorrect identification of table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should match the table name against each line in the stdout output rather than looking for an exact match in the entire output. This way, it can accurately determine if a table exists in the database based on the complete line from the stdout.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split("\n"))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the stdout into lines and then check if the table name exists in any line to ensure an accurate match.
- We return a boolean value based on the existence of stdout in the partition check.

This corrected version addresses the bug in the original function by properly checking for table existence.
