The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. This condition wrongly returns `True` when the table is not found in the output string `stdout`.

The issue occurs because `stdout` is not parsed correctly from the `run_hive_cmd` output, leading to incorrect evaluation in the condition.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the parsing logic for `stdout` to correctly check for the presence of the table name. We should split the `stdout` string by newlines and then check if any line exactly matches the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version properly splits the `stdout` string into a list of tables and then checks if the table is in that list. It also strips the newline characters to enhance comparison accuracy.

The updated function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
