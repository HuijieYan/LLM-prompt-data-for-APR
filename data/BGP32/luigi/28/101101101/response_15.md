### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statements for checking the existence of a table. In the first part of the conditional, when there is no partition specified, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the comparison should be done with the split output of `stdout` rather than `stdout` as a whole. In the second part of the conditional, when a partition is specified, the function checks if the `stdout` is a truthy value to determine the existence of the table, which is incorrect. It should directly return the boolean value of `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Split the `stdout` by newline character ('\n') in both parts of the conditional statement for accurate comparison with the `table`.
2. Modify the second part of the conditional to return the boolean value of `stdout` directly.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making these adjustments in the `table_exists` function, it should now correctly handle the comparison of tables with the output and return the expected boolean values, thus passing the failing test cases.
