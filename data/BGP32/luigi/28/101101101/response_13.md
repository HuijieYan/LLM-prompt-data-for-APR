The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is not handling the case where the table name is included in other strings returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to false positives.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition check when parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that the table name is properly isolated.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now correctly parses the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks if the table name is a standalone entry in the returned string.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases mentioned.
