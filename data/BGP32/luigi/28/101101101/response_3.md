### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `table in stdout` where `stdout` contains both the table name and additional text. This comparison fails because the table name is not an exact match due to the presence of additional characters in `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check for the presence of the exact table name within the `stdout`. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` based on newlines and then checking each line for an exact match with the table name without any extra characters.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newlines in the `else` block, we can accurately check if the table name exists in the result without additional characters causing a mismatch. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
