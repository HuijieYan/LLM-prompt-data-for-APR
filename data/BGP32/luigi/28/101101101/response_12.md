### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statement where the function checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists. The issue is that in the current implementation, it only checks whether the table name is in the `stdout` string, which can lead to false positives in cases where the table name is a substring of another table name in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table exists in the `stdout`. Instead of just checking if the table name is present in the output, we should split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the exact table name matches any line in the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` string by newline characters before checking for the table name, we ensure that we are comparing the exact table name instead of a substring, thus fixing the bug in the `table_exists` function.
