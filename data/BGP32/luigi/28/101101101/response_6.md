The bug in the provided `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of the table by using the `in` operator on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without splitting the result. This leads to incorrect results as it only checks if the table name is present in the entire output string.

To fix the bug, we need to split the stdout string into lines and then check if the table name is present in any of those lines. Additionally, for the case where a partition is provided, we need to properly format the query string to include the partition specification.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
from typing import Dict

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        partition_spec_str = " ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_spec_str))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We split the stdout string using `splitlines()` in the first case to ensure we check each line individually for the existence of the table name.
- For the case with a partition, we properly format the partition specification string using a dictionary comprehension to construct key-value pairs and join them with spaces. Then, we include the partition specification in the command string sent to `run_hive_cmd`.
- We return `bool(stdout)` directly to ensure consistency and proper handling of the return value.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly check for the existence of the table in both cases and pass the failing test cases.
