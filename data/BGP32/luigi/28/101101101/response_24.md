### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a problem in handling the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns a string containing the table name. The function is checking for an exact match of the table name in the output, which can cause issues in scenarios where the table name appears as part of a larger string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does a direct string comparison to check if the table exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. This can lead to false negatives if the table name is part of a larger string in the output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the buggy function to ensure that the table name is a standalone word in the output. One effective way to do this is by using regular expressions to match the table name in the output string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(re.escape(table)), stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using regular expressions with word boundaries (`\b`), we ensure that the table name is matched as a standalone word in the output. This correction should make the function more robust and pass the failing tests.
