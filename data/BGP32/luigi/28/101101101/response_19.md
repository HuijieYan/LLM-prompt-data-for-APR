In the provided buggy function `table_exists`, the issue lies in the condition checking part where it verifies if the table exists in the stdout. The bug occurs due to the partial match check in the condition. If the table name is a substring of another table name, the condition might incorrectly return True.

To fix this bug, a better approach would be to split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the exact table name exists in the list of tables.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` and checking for an exact match with the table name, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table, fixing the bug.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases described above.
