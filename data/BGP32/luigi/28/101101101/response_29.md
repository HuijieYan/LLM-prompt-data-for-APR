The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the conditional check on the `stdout` variable. The function checks if `stdout` has a truthy value to determine if the table exists, which may not be accurate in all cases.

To fix this bug, we should explicitly check if the table name exists in the `stdout` variable, regardless of its truthiness. This way, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the table existence based on the content of `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By making this slight modification to the function, it now explicitly checks if the table name exists in the `stdout` variable, ensuring the correct behavior. It should now pass the failing unit tests.
