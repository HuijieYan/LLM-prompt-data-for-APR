The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the check for table existence in the `stdout` output. The function checks if the table name is directly in the `stdout` string, which can lead to incorrect results if the table name appears as part of another word. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the table name is matched exactly in the `stdout` string. We can modify the code to split the `stdout` string by line and then check if any line exactly matches the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            for t in tables:
                if t == table:
                    return True
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by splitting the `stdout` string by lines and then checking for an exact table name match in each line. This ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of the table.
