### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it checks for the presence of a table or partition in Hive. In the first case, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect as it will be True even if the `table` substring is found within `stdout`. The function should explicitly handle this case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking the presence of a table in `stdout`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the partition information is correctly processed in the case where a partition is provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table == stdout.strip()
    else:
        partition_str = ", ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that the table or partition presence is accurately checked based on the provided conditions in the function.
