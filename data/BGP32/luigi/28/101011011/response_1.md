### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is checking whether the given `table` exists in the `stdout` string returned from a Hive command. The checks are case sensitive, leading to failures when the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with the `stdout`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison check `table in stdout`. The comparison should be made case-insensitive to accommodate the scenarios where the table names might differ in case.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the case-sensitive comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` string, leading to false negatives in the validation of table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` string is case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both strings to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparison to make it case-insensitive.
- The comparison in the `if` block now checks for `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.

This corrected version ensures that the function properly matches the table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing tests and addressing the reported GitHub issue.
