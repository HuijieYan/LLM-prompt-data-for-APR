### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison between the table name and the contents of `stdout` might be case-sensitive.
2. The check for table existence in `stdout` might not correctly handle case insensitivity.
3. The implementation of the `table_exists` function might not consider case insensitivity for table names.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does a direct string comparison between the `table` name and the contents of `stdout`. This comparison is case-sensitive, causing the function to fail when the case of the table names in `table` and `stdout` does not match. This behavior is not aligned with the expected case-insensitive behavior for checking table existence, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the contents of `stdout` needs to be made case-insensitive. One approach is to convert both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This modification will ensure that the function correctly identifies table existence irrespective of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the table name and the contents of `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This modification ensures that the function handles table existence checks in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
