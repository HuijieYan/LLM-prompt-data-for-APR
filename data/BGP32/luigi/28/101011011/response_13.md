### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class is failing due to case sensitivity issues. The function checks if a table exists in Hive by running a command and comparing the output.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that tables with names in different cases can fail due to Hive being case-insensitive, but the function is case-sensitive.
3. The failing test cases show that the function fails when comparing table names with different cases like `'mytable'` and `'MyTable'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function `table_exists` to convert both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be case-insensitive and resolve the failing tests.
