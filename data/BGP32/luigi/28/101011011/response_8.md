### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the table name in the `stdout` output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It fails to account for case sensitivity, leading to test failures as indicated by the error messages.
2. The `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` might not match the case of the input `table` parameter, causing the comparison to fail.
3. The related GitHub issues (#896 and proposed fix) suggest making the comparison case insensitive to handle discrepancies between table names due to case.
4. To fix the bug, modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.
5. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table` parameter is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the lines in `stdout`.
- The lines in `stdout` are also converted to lowercase to make the comparison case insensitive.
- By making both sides of the comparison lowercase, the function can properly determine table existence irrespective of case differences.
