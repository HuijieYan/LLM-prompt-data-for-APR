### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout is case-sensitive. When checking for table existence, the function compares the provided table name with the tables listed in the stdout without considering case differences, leading to incorrect results.

The failing tests demonstrate this issue by showing that the function does not handle case differences between the provided table name and the tables listed in the stdout correctly, resulting in failed assertions.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the provided table name and the tables listed in the stdout to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with the bug fixed:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the provided table name and the tables listed in the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.
