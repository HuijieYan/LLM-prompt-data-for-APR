### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking table names against the output obtained from Hive commands.
2. The failing test cases are checking for table names like "mytable" and "MyTable" which should be considered equal irrespective of case.
3. The stdout value retrieved from the Hive command needs to be compared after converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive to handle such scenarios.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Modify the buggy function `table_exists` to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
2. Update the `if` condition to compare lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout`.
3. Ensure the corrected version passes the failing tests.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the `table_exists` function as mentioned above, the case sensitivity issues should be resolved, and the function should now be able to handle table names in a case-insensitive manner, passing the failing tests.
