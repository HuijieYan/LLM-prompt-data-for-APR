### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is failing because it compares the table name directly with the `stdout` variable, which might not have the correct case.
2. The issue on GitHub suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the `stdout`.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate the failure due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Correction Rationale:
- The corrected code converts both the table name and the `stdout` value to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison to make it case-insensitive.
- By comparing the lowercase versions, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters in the table names, resolving the issue identified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now accurately check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the reported bug and the failing tests.
