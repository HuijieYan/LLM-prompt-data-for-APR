### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases since the comparison between the table name and the content of stdout is case-sensitive. This causes discrepancies when the table name's case doesn't match with the case returned in stdout. The issue is related to table name case insensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function `table_exists` compares the table name directly with the content of stdout, leading to case-sensitive mismatches.
- When the table name and the name in stdout have different casing, the comparison fails.
- The failing tests highlight this issue, as they expect case-insensitive table existence checks.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout content to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for a case-insensitive match.
- This change ensures that both the table name and the content of stdout are converted to lowercase for comparison, fixing the case sensitivity issue.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function will pass the failing tests and align with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
