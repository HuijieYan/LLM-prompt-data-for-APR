### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs due to a case-sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the table name is present in the output received from a Hive command by running a check with `table in stdout`. However, this operation is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the table names do not match in case.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the comparison `table in stdout` where it does not account for case differences, causing the test failures when matching table names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the failing tests as the function checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the Hive command, leading to false negatives when cases do not match. This behavior triggers the assertion failures in the test cases provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. By converting both strings to lowercase or uppercase before comparison, we can avoid the case-sensitivity issue and improve the function's behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, resolving the bug and making the function more robust as required by the open GitHub issues #896.
