### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests due to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The tests are returning incorrect results, leading to assertions failing.

#### Identified issue:
The bug arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the standard output (`stdout`) is case-sensitive. This causes issues when checking for the existence of tables with different capitalizations.

#### Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Utilize the `lower()` method on both the `table` and the `stdout` strings for a case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in Hive. By converting both the table name and the tables listed in the output to lowercase before comparison, the bug is fixed, and the failing tests pass. This solution aligns with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896, making the `table_exists` function more robust.
