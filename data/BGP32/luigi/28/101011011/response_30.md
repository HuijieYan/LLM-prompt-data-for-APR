### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to correctly check for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly when comparing the provided table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The failing tests show discrepancies in behavior when the table names are capitalized in the test cases, resulting in assertions failing due to case mismatches.
4. The GitHub issue #896 and the detailed description provide context on the expected behavior of making `table_exists` case insensitive and checking stdout against the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug:
The bug is within the comparison logic of the `table_exists` function, particularly when comparing the returned `stdout` with the provided `table` parameter. The function is failing to account for case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the comparison between the `table` and the `stdout` needs to be done after converting both to lowercase. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the table names. 

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, resolving the failing test cases and aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
