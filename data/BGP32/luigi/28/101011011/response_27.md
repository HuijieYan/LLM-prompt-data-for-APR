### Identify the Bug
The bug is related to the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The issue arises because the table name is not being converted to lowercase for comparison.

### Cause of the Bug
1. In the failing test cases, the table name provided is not converted to lowercase, while the `stdout` output from Hive is in lowercase.
2. Since the comparison is done without any case transformation, it leads to failures when comparing the table names.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the table name is converted to lowercase for comparison with the `stdout` output. This way, the comparison will be case-insensitive.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Compare in lowercase
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
        return bool(stdout)  # No need to perform additional comparison
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the function will be case-insensitive as intended. This corrected version addresses the bug and should pass the failing test cases.
