### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function where it checks for the existence of a table but doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly. The function should be case insensitive when comparing the table names with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Error Cause:
1. In the first case, with `table="mytable"` and `stdout="OK"`, the function wrongly considers the table name case-sensitive resulting in a false outcome.
2. In the second case, the same issue arises as the function fails to handle case insensitivity correctly.
3. The third and fourth cases showcase the incorrect handling of case sensitivity when comparing table names in `stdout` causing test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Updated to be case insensitive
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return True if stdout else False
```

### Corrections Made:
- Updated the comparison in the `if` block to be case insensitive by using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.
- Refactored the return statements for readability and consistency.

This corrected version should resolve the issue of case sensitivity and pass the failing tests.
