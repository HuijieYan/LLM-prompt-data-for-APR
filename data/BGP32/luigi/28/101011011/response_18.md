### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists()` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Hive is case insensitive, so the comparison between the table name and the output should be done without case sensitivity considerations.

When the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` are compared directly, the case sensitivity causes the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive. This change addresses the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub discussion related to the case sensitivity problem in `table_exists`.
