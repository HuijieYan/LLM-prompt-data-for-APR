### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues. The function should perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name to the table names retrieved from the Hive commands.
2. The output from the Hive commands may contain different casing than the input table name, causing the equality check to fail.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is failing because the output is not matching the expected table name with the correct case.
4. To resolve this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from the Hive commands.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before performing the comparison in both branches of the `if` statement.
2. Compare the lowercase version of the table name with the converted table names from the Hive commands to ensure a case-insensitive match.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By adopting this corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the bug causing case sensitivity issues will be resolved, and the failing tests will pass.
