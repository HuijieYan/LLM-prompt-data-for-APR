### Analyze and Identify the Bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function exists due to a case sensitivity issue where the function does not account for the case of the table names when comparing against the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This leads to test failures, especially when the table names have different cases.

### Explanation of Bug Cause
- The function compares the table name without considering the case sensitivity when checking if the table exists by directly checking against the `stdout`.
- As a result, when the tested table name and the one returned from `stdout` have different cases, the comparison fails, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the returned table names from `stdout` is case insensitive. This can be done by converting both names to lowercase for comparison.

### Correction of the Buggy Function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the returned table names from `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the corrected function now ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
