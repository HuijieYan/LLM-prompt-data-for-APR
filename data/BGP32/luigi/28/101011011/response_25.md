### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function when comparing the table name with the content of `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises because this comparison is case-sensitive. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` compares the table name with the `stdout` content directly without considering case insensitivity. This causes the function to fail when the case of the table name and `stdout` do not match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` data to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison. By doing so, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
