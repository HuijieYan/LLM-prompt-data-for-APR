### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue arises because the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is case-sensitive.
2. The function is designed to return `True` if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, otherwise `False`.
3. The error occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to failures when the case of the table name is different in the output.
4. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase when checking for table existence, the function will be case-insensitive and match without issues regardless of the case discrepancies. This corrected version should resolve the failing test cases mentioned.
