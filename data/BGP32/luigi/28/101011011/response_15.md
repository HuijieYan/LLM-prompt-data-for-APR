### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `table` parameter with the `stdout` result from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In cases where the table name has different cases (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable'), the comparison fails due to case sensitivity.

The failing test cases highlighted this issue by showing that the function returns incorrect results when comparing table names with different cases.

To address this problem, the comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` result should be made case-insensitive.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison of `table` and `stdout` to be case-insensitive. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence irrespective of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` result to lowercase during comparison, the function ensures that case differences do not affect the outcome. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue (#896) and resolves the failing test cases.
