### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a specified database. If a partition is given, it also checks for the existence of the partition. The bug seems to be related to how the partition check is executed when a partition is provided. `self.partition_spec(partition)` is called to construct the partition specification, but it might not be returning the expected format, potentially causing issues in the command execution.

### Bug:
When a partition is provided, the function `table_exists` constructs a command using `self.partition_spec(partition)`. If `self.partition_spec(partition)` does not return the expected string representation of the partition, the command execution might fail or return incorrect results, leading to incorrect output.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.partition_spec(partition)` returns the correct string representation of the partition to be included in the Hive command. Additionally, we should handle the case where no partition is provided more explicitly for better readability.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ''
        if isinstance(partition, dict):
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the partition specification is properly constructed before executing the Hive command. The partition is now represented as key-value pairs matching the expected format in the command. The `if isinstance(partition, dict)` condition helps handle dictionary type partitions effectively.
