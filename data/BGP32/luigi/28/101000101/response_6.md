### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional checks for the existence of a specific table or partition. The function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table or partition exists.

In the case where `partition` is `None`, the function runs a query and checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`. However, the `stdout` may not contain only the table name, resulting in incorrect evaluations.

In the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function constructs a command to show partitions and uses the `self.partition_spec(partition)` method to get the partition specification. If the output is not empty, the function returns `True`, but this may not accurately reflect the existence of the partition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly processes the output of the commands it runs. Instead of simply checking if the table or partition name is present in the `stdout`, we should parse the output more accurately to confirm the existence.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return any(partition == line.strip().split('=')[1] for line in stdout.split('/'))

``` 

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and processing them more accurately according to the expected format, the corrected function will now properly identify the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive environment.
