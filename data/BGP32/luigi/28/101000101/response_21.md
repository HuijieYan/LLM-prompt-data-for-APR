### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a given table exists in a specific database with an optional partition. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. In the case where a partition is provided, the function also calls `self.partition_spec` to generate the partition string.

The bug occurs in the else block, where the Hive command is executed with a partition. The current implementation of the code is not handling the response correctly, leading to incorrect return values. The issue lies in the logic that checks `stdout` for a truthy value, which may not accurately determine the existence of a table with a given partition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to accurately check for the existence of both tables with and without partitions. We should update the conditional statements to incorporate proper checks for the presence of the table in the Hive output.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Import the required modules
from typing import Optional

# This function remains as it is
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Body of this function remains the same

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # The method partition_spec is assumed to be defined elsewhere

    def table_exists(self, table: str, database='default', partition: Optional[dict] = None) -> bool:
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))
            return table in stdout

# Update the buggy function with the corrected version
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to check the `table` existence in the `stdout` appropriately, we can ensure the corrected function meets the expected input/output values for all test cases.
