The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database along with an optional partition. The issue lies in the conditional check on the `stdout` variable after running the `run_hive_cmd` function in both cases.

#### Bug Cause:
1. In the first case, the bug occurs when checking `table in stdout`, where the check doesn't cover scenarios where the table name is mixed case or the stdout contains other characters besides the table name. This can happen if multiple tables are returned in the result.
2. In the second case, the same issue occurs due to the same reason where the check is being performed on the entire stdout string including multiple tables.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly parse the `stdout` and check for the specific table name.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by newline characters and checks if the table/partition exists in any of the lines returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This way, it will handle cases where multiple tables/partitions are returned, ensuring a more accurate check.
