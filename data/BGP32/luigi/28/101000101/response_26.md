### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute queries against the Hive database. There are two main branches in the function:
1. When `partition` is `None`, it runs a query to check if the table exists in the database.
2. When `partition` is provided, it constructs a query to show partitions for the specific table and partition.

The bug in the function is related to the conditions in the if statements where it checks the truthiness of `stdout`. It doesn't correctly handle the empty string or None values returned by `run_hive_cmd`, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function arises from the way it checks the `stdout` variable. In Python, an empty string (`""`) is considered falsy, which is different from `None`. If `run_hive_cmd` returns an empty string, the logical check `stdout and table in stdout` or `if stdout` will not work as expected, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check for `None` in addition to empty strings in the `stdout` variable. This will ensure that we cover all cases where the query execution may return an empty result.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout and len(stdout) > 0
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and len(stdout) > 0
``` 

### Justification
In the corrected version of the function, we added an explicit check for `len(stdout) > 0` in addition to `stdout` in both branches of the if statements. This ensures that we handle both `None` and empty string cases properly, providing a more robust check for the existence of the table.
