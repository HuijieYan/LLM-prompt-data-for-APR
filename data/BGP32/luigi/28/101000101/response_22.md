### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. If a partition is provided, it constructs a command to check for partitions as well. The bug seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is evaluated for truthiness.

### Issues
1. In the first `if` block, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may produce unexpected results based on the contents of `stdout`.
2. In the second `else` block, the condition `if stdout` might not be sufficient to determine if the table/partition exists based on the output format of `run_hive_cmd`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Explicitly check if the `stdout` contains the table name in a more precise way.
2. Verify if the `stdout` in the `else` block contains any output indicating the existence of the table/partition.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return any(partition in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
``` 

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and then checks for the presence of the table or partition in the output. This approach ensures a more precise and accurate verification of table existence.
