The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where the function checks if `stdout` is a non-empty string. In the case where `stdout` is empty, the function incorrectly returns `False`, which is not the correct behavior according to the expected values.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check if `stdout` is not empty or None before checking if the table name is in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

By making this change, the function will correctly return `False` when `stdout` is empty or None, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior defined in the test cases.
