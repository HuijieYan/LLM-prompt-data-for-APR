### Analysis
- The function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database. It also has the option to check for existence within a specific partition.
- The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute commands in Hive.
- In the first part of the function, when `partition` is `None`, it checks the table's existence by running a Hive command and searching for the table name in the output.
- In the second part of the function, when `partition` is provided, it constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of a specific partition for the table.
- The bugs seem to arise from potential issues in constructing and executing the Hive commands.

### Bug
The primary bug in the provided function is in the second part where the Hive command is constructed to check for partition existence. The formatting of the command seems to be incorrect, likely causing issues with how Hive interprets the query.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly formulate the Hive command when checking for partition existence. Ensuring that the command is structured in a way that Hive can understand and execute successfully is crucial.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_spec_str))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version adjusts the way the partition specification is included in the Hive command by appropriately formatting the partition key-value pairs. It also ensures that a boolean value is returned based on the presence of a stdout response.
