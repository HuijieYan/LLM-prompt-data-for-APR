The bug in the provided function is related to how the `stdout` variable is checked for the existence of the table or partition. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and capture the output in `stdout`. However, the condition to check for table existence or partition existence is incorrect.

In the case where `partition` is `None`, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`. This logic is correct.

But in the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function tries to show partitions based on the partition spec and then checks if the `stdout` is not empty. This can lead to issues if the partition does not exist but the command still outputs something.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of how we check the existence of the table or partition based on the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return table in stdout.split()
```

This corrected version correctly splits the output of the `show partitions` command by newline to get the list of partitions. It then checks if the `table` is in the list of partitions. This ensures that the function correctly checks for the existence of the table or partition based on the command output.
