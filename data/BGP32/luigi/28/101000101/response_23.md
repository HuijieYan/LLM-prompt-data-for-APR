## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database or if a specific partition exists for a table in a database. The bug arises from the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with the query strings. The first query is missing the `show tables like "{1}";` part, and the second query has a formatting issue with the partition spec.

## Bug
1. The first query in the `table_exists` function does not include `show tables like "{1}";`, which is needed to check if the table exists.
2. The formatting of the second query in the `table_exists` function for checking partition existence is incorrect.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Add `show tables like "{1}";` to the first query in the `table_exists` function.
2. Fix the formatting of the second query to properly check partition existence.

## The corrected version of the function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = ', '.join(['%s=%s' % (k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_query))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
