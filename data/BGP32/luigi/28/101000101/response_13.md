### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table or a partition in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the Hive commands are constructed and executed.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the case of checking for a table without a partition:
   - The function constructs a Hive command using `run_hive_cmd` to check if the table exists in the specified database.
   - The bug lies in how the `stdout` from the Hive command is checked. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not work as expected, especially when the list of tables returned includes additional unwanted characters.
   
2. In the case of checking for a table with a partition:
   - The function constructs a more complex Hive command using the `partition_spec` method. This command should show partitions for a specific table in the database with the specified partition.
   - Similar to the previous case, the bug lies in how the `stdout` from the Hive command is checked. The current implementation simply checks for the existence of the `stdout`, which may not accurately determine the existence of the table with the specified partition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition for checking the existence of the table in `stdout`. Instead of a simple substring check, it would be better to parse the `stdout` more accurately to ensure that the table name is an exact match.
   
2. In the case of checking for a table with a partition, the `stdout` should be parsed more accurately to determine if the specified partition exists for the table.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        def parse_table_list(table_list):
            return [row.strip() for row in table_list.split('\n') if row.strip()]

        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = parse_table_list(stdout)
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = parse_table_list(stdout)
            partition_str = '/'.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            return partition_str in partitions
```

The corrected version of the function now accurately checks for the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive database by parsing the output more effectively. It splits the `stdout` into rows and then checks for the exact table name or partition spec to determine existence.
