The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue related to the way it checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The primary problem lies in the comparison of the table name within the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The buggy function does not handle the case where the table name might be part of a larger string in the output.

To fix this issue, we can split the stdout string on newline characters and then check if any of the lines exactly match the table name. This will ensure that we correctly identify the table's existence from the output of the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)

```

This corrected version handles the case where the table name might be part of a larger string by splitting the output on newline characters and then checking for an exact match. This ensures that the function behaves correctly for all the expected cases mentioned.
