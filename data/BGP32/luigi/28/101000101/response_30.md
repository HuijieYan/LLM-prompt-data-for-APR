The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where the condition checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue lies in the `stdout` variable check for truthiness, which might not work as expected in all cases.

1. The bug arises when checking for the presence of the table name in stdout by using `stdout and table in stdout`. This can lead to incorrect results if the stdout contains any string that evaluates to `False`. Instead of this, we can check explicitly against `None`.

2. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to explicitly check for `None` for `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

This fix addresses the issue of checking stdout against None explicitly, ensuring a reliable check for the existence of the table.
