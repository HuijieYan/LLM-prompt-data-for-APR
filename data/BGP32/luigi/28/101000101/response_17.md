The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the conditional checks for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout` variable. The issue arises due to the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called to retrieve the output, which might not always return a direct match to the table name, hence leading to incorrect results in the checks.

To fix this bug, we should modify the conditional checks to ensure that the table name is extracted correctly from the `stdout` output. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` string appropriately based on the output format of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)

```

By splitting the `stdout` string and using the `strip` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces, we can accurately check for the presence of the table name in the output. This fix ensures that the function returns the correct results based on the expected input/output values provided.
