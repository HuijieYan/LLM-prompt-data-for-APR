### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table (with or without partition) exists in a specified database by using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. In the cases where a partition is provided, the `partition_spec` method is called to format the partition information.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the commands are constructed and executed using `run_hive_cmd`.
4. The function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if not.

### Bug:
The bug is located in the construction of the Hive commands in the `table_exists` function. The command used to check for table existence in the presence of partitions is not correctly formatted. This leads to incorrect results being returned.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the formatting of the Hive commands passed to `run_hive_cmd`. Specifically, in the case where a partition is provided, the command needs to be constructed correctly to check for the existence of the table with the given partition details.

### Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            part_string = ','.join([f"{key}='{value}'" for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, part_string))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By adjusting the construction of the Hive commands, specifically when checking for table existence with partitions, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table with the given partition details.
