The bug in the provided function `table_exists` arises due to the incorrect formatting of the query that is executed to determine the existence of a table or partition in Hive. The bug can be attributed to the `run_hive_cmd` function call with incorrect query strings.

The strategy to fix this bug involves modifying the query strings in the `run_hive_cmd` calls to correctly check the existence of tables and partitions in Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now properly check for the existence of tables as well as partitions in Hive and return the expected results as defined in the test cases.
