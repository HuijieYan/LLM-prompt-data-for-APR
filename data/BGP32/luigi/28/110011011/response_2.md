### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity while comparing the table name extracted from the Hive command output.
2. The failing tests are showing that the function does not correctly identify the table name due to case sensitivity issues.
3. The failing scenarios reveal that the comparison of the `table` parameter with the table names extracted from the Hive command output is not taking into account case differences, leading to assertions failure during testing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive by converting both the `table` parameter and the table names extracted from the command output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the extracted table names to lowercase during comparison, the `table_exists` function now handles case sensitivity correctly. This modification ensures that the function can accurately check for the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner as desired in the GitHub issue.
