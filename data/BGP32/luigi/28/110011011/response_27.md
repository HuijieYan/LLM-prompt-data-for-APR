### Analyzing the Bug

1. **Buggy Function Relation with Class**:
   - The `table_exists` function is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class that utilizes `hive` invocations to find information in the HiveClient.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - The bug might be occurring in the comparison logic where the `table_exists` function checks if the returned table name matches the input table name.
   - The case sensitivity issue arises from a direct equality check without considering the case of the table names.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug originates from the `table_exists` function's comparison logic, which directly checks for equality between the provided table name and the table name obtained from the `stdout`.
   - Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison fails when there are differences in case between the input table name and the table name returned by Hive. This discrepancy causes the tests to fail.

4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - To resolve the bug, modify the comparison logic to make it case-insensitive by converting both the input table name and the table name from `stdout` to a consistent case before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            return True if stdout else False
```

### Correction Explanation:
- Two modifications were made in the corrected version:
   1. Converted both `table` and the table name obtained from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it case-insensitive.
   2. Improved formatting by using f-strings for string interpolation in Python.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and handle the case sensitivity issue as described in the GitHub issue.
