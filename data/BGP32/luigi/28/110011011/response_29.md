The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is causing the tests to fail because it does not handle case sensitivity properly when comparing the table names. The function currently checks if the table name exists in the output of the Hive command without considering the case of the table names.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue #896.

This correction should now pass the failing tests, resolve the issue raised in GitHub, and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
