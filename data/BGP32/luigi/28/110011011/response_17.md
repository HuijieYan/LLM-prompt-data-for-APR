### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands and check if a table exists. However, the function doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.
2. The bug arises from comparing the table name directly without considering case sensitivity, causing discrepancies between the expected and actual results.
3. The failing test cases provide inputs and outputs where the case of the table names doesn't match with what is returned by Hive, leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of table names is case insensitive, by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to a consistent case before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Correction Explanation:
1. The corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that both the `table` name and the `stdout` response from Hive are converted to lowercase for case insensitive comparison.
2. By converting both strings to lowercase, we eliminate the issue related to case sensitivity and ensure consistent behavior across different table name formats.
3. The `in` comparison now checks if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase stdout response, addressing the bug highlighted by the failing tests.
4. The bug fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity correctly and pass the failing tests.
