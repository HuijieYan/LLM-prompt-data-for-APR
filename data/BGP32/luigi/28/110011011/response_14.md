### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly. The function currently checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the Hive command, leading to test failures when the case of table names doesn't match the case of the output.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the function compares the table name directly with the output string from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. If the case of the table name and the output don't match, the function incorrectly determines the table doesn't exist, leading to the test failures observed.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the output string from the Hive command to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case of the table name or the output.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` string are converted to lower case before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This modification aligns with the suggested fix on GitHub issue #896.

By using this corrected implementation, the function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle case sensitivity in table existence checks.
