### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The bug arises when comparing the table name extracted from `stdout` against the input table name without considering case differences.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table names in `stdout` and the input table name mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name from `stdout` and the input table name to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code in the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name in `stdout` and the input table name to lowercase before comparison.
2. This adjustment will ensure that the function behaves as expected, irrespective of the casing differences in table names.
3. By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function should pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue regarding case sensitivity.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By updating the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class with the corrected code, the case sensitivity issue should be resolved, and the tests should pass as expected.
