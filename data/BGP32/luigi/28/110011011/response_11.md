### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The failing test cases are checking for table existence with different letter cases, leading to assertions failures.
3. The bug is related to the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive query. The function does not handle case insensitivity correctly, causing incorrect evaluations.
4. A strategy to fix the bug is to ensure case insensitivity by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive query to a consistent case (lowercase or uppercase) before comparison.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- Convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- Simplify the partition query string construction using `f-strings`.
- Return `bool(stdout)` directly, as it already represents the existence check result.

By making these corrections, the function will handle case insensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
