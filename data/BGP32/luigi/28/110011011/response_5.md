### Analyzing the Bug:
The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. The function is not handling case insensitivity properly, leading to the tests failing.

### Error Cause:
- The buggy function does not convert both the table name and the output from Hive commands to a consistent case, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

```

### Changes Made:
- Added lowercase conversion to both `table` and `stdout` values in the `return` statement for case insensitivity.
- Modified the return statement for the `else` block to simplify with `bool()` to ensure a logical return based on `stdout`.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle case insensitivity for table existence checks, passing the failing tests.
