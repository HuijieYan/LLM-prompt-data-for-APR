### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in the Hive environment.
2. The failing tests are based on whether the function correctly identifies if a table exists or not, regardless of the case of the table name.
3. The bug arises from the fact that the function compares the exact table name with the output from the Hive query, which can be in a different case due to Hive's case-insensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive query needs to be case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check between the table name and the output from the Hive query.
2. Use lowercase versions of both the table name and the output from the query for comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

```

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive query is now done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
