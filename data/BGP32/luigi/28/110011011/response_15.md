### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists()` is responsible for checking whether a table exists in the Hive database. The issue arises when the function compares the table name with the output from the Hive command, leading to case sensitivity problems.
2. The buggy function fails to account for case differences in table names, causing the tests to fail when the case of the table names doesn't match the output from Hive.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the direct comparison of the table name with the case-sensitive output from Hive. This results in false negatives when the case doesn't match, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.
4. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lower case before checking for existence.
5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
