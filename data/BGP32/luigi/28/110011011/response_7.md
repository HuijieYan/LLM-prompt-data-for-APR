### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to arise due to a case-sensitivity issue where the table name in the `stdout` variable is not being compared with the lowercase version of the input table name.
3. The failing test cases provide input parameter values and the `stdout` variable for different scenarios, showing that the function fails to correctly identify table existence due to case differences.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output is case-insensitive.
5. The proposed fix involves converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase during comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive table existence checks, passing the failing tests and resolving the GitHub issue.
