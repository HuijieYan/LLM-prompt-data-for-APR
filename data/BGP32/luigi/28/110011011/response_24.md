### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function is case sensitive, causing mismatches between the expected and actual table names.
4. The suggestion from the GitHub issue is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting table names to lower case for comparison.
   
### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive commands to lower case before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will be case insensitive and should pass the failing tests.
