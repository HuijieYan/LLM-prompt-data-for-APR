### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Error Message

The `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The function is comparing the table names without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table name case differs in the `stdout` result. The test cases are failing because the function is performing a direct comparison without considering the case. The error message highlights this failure, as the function is returning `False` instead of considering the correct table existence due to case mismatch.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The potential error locations in the function are the comparison points between the table name and the content of `stdout`. The function should account for case insensitivity when checking if the table exists in the Hive.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug

The cause of the bug is due to the function not handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function directly compares the table name with the `stdout`, leading to failures when the case does not match. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should have been designed to handle this appropriately.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` needs to be case insensitive. Converting both the table name and the `stdout` content to lowercase before comparison will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` content to lowercase before comparison, the function will now accurately determine the existence of the table in Hive, irrespective of the case.
