Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison with `table` in `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
2. The partition case is not handled properly in the function.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the comparison between the table name (`table`) and the output from the Hive command (`stdout`) is case-sensitive. This leads to false failures in tests where the case of the table name differs between what is stored in Hive and what is passed to the `table_exists` function. The fix involves making the comparison case-insensitive to align it with Hive's behavior.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and fulfill the GitHub issue, modify the function `table_exists` to perform a case-insensitive string comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This modification ensures that the check is consistent with Hive's case-insensitive behavior and resolves the failing tests.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive (using `lower()`), the corrected function will align with Hive's case-insensitive behavior. This adjustment ensures that the function's output matches the expected behavior and resolves the failing tests related to table existence checks in Hive.
