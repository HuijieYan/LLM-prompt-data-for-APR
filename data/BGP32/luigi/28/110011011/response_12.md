### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database by performing a Hive command. The issue arises when the table names are case-sensitive, leading to failing tests due to case mismatch.
2. The potential error lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` which may not match due to case sensitivity.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `table` name and the names returned by Hive are case-sensitive, resulting in failed assertions due to mismatch. The failing test cases provide inputs where the case of the table name causes the function to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the names returned by Hive to lowercase before the comparison.
5. To correct the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and should allow the function to pass the failing tests.
