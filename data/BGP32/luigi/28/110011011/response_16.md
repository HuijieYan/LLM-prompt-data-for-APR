### Analyzing the Buggy Function

#### 1. Relationship with Buggy Class
The `table_exists` function is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which inherits from `HiveClient`.

#### 2. Corresponding Error Message
The error message indicates that the test cases are failing due to the function not returning the expected values.

#### 3. Runtime Input/Output Values
In all failing test cases, the function fails to correctly determine if a table exists based on the returned stdout from the `run_hive_cmd`.

#### 4. GitHub Issue
The GitHub issue highlights the problem with case sensitivity in table existence checks, which is exactly the issue reflected in failing tests.

### Potential Error Locations
The issue seems to be with how the function compares the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the function not handling case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function directly compares the `table` name without considering case differences in the returned output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` needs to be made case-insensitive. Converting both strings to lowercase before comparison should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
