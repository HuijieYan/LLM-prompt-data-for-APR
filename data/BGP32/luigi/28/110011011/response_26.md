### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in a given database by executing Hive commands. The bug seems to stem from case sensitivity issues, where the table names are not matched correctly due to case differences.
2. The bug occurs when the table name case doesn't match the case of the table in the Hive database causing the test to fail.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function checks the exact match of the table name from the Hive command output, leading to case sensitivity errors. The tests are failing because of the incorrect comparison of the table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive so that the function can correctly identify the table existence regardless of the case.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to make the check case-insensitive. This modification allows for a proper detection of the table existence in various cases.
