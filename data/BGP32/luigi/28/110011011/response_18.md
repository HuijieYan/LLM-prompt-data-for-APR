### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a particular table exists in a database by running Hive commands. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, leading to inconsistencies due to case sensitivity.
2. The bug is related to the incorrect handling of case sensitivity in table names when comparing with the Hive command output.
3. The error occurs because the function does a direct string comparison between the table name and the content of the Hive command output, leading to failures when the cases do not match. This inconsistency causes the failing tests due to unexpected case sensitivity.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output content to lowercase before comparison, we can resolve the issue and make the function more robust.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output content to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, resolving the issue reported in the failing tests.
