### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive.
2. The bug occurs at the point of comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when checking for tables that have different cases than expected due to case insensitivity of Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the table name and output tables to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- The output from Hive is split by newline characters to handle multiple table names.
- We use `map` to apply `str.lower` to each table name in the output for comparison.
- The if condition checks for the existence of the table in the processed list of tables.

This correction addresses the issue of case sensitivity when checking for table existence, in line with the GitHub issues reported and the failing test cases.
