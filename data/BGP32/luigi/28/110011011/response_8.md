### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a given table exists in a specific database. The bug arises from potential case sensitivity issues as reported in GitHub issues #896 and #897.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison between the `table` argument and the tables in the standard output (`stdout`).
2. In the second part of the function where partitions are checked.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug stems from the case sensitivity of comparing the table names. Since Hive is not case-sensitive, comparing the table name to a lowercased version of tables in `stdout` can lead to false negatives.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables in `stdout` is case-insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # No need to check explicitly True/False

```

### Changes Made
1. Converted `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
2. Removed unnecessary conditional checks in the return statements for partitions.

By applying these modifications, the function now ensures the correct identification of table existence in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issues.
