### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity.
2. The function uses outputs from hive commands to determine table existence. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output from the command.
3. The cause of the bug is that the table name comparison is case-sensitive, while Hive is case-insensitive. This causes the function to fail when checking for table existence with different casing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the command to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the outputs to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now handle the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing tests.
