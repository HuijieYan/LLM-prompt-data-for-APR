### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly while checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The issue arises when the table exists, but due to differences in case between the input table name and the actual table name in Hive, the function fails to return the correct result.
3. By analyzing the issue on GitHub, it is clear that the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to properly determine if a table exists.
4. The bug can be fixed by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})'
        )

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity and should return the expected results for the provided test cases.
