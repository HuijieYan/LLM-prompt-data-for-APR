### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check whether a table exists in the specified Hive database. The bug appears to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
2. The error occurred during testing because the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from `stdout`.
3. The input table names are not handled consistently, leading to failures when comparing them with the expected output. The issue discussed on GitHub suggests making the comparison case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the names retrieved from `stdout` is done in a case-insensitive manner.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the retrieved names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of a table. This modification aligns with the suggestion in the GitHub issue and should resolve the failing test cases.
