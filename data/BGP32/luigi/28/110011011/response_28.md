### Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity properly. The function checks if the table exists by directly matching the table name with the tables in the database, leading to issues with case-sensitive comparisons. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling uppercase and lowercase table names correctly.

The provided runtime values show that the function receives the correct parameters but fails to handle case sensitivity in the database table names, causing the tests to fail.

The corresponding GitHub issue #896 highlights this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve this issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not performing a case-insensitive comparison when checking table existence based on the standard output (stdout) of Hive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables in the database. By using lower-case versions for comparison purposes, we can ensure that the function correctly detects the existence of tables irrespective of their case.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the suggested fix in GitHub issue #896.
