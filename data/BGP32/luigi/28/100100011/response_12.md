## Corrections to the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has been identified to have a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue described in the GitHub report indicates that the function should be case insensitive while comparing the table name.

### Analysis of the Bug:
- The bug lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` variable, where case sensitivity is not handled.
- The function does not convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- The failing test case reveals the issue when trying to verify table existence using different case variations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- Update the `table_exists` function to handle case variations when checking for table existence in Hive.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` variables are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to table existence checks in Hive.
