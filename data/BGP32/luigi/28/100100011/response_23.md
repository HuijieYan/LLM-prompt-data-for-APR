Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. The function currently compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue (#896) and addresses the failing test scenario where the table names have different cases.
