Based on the analysis of the buggy function, test code, and GitHub issue, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity. The function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the function, we are using the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the result from Hive to lowercase for comparison. This modification will ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

By implementing this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of table existence checks in Hive.
