The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function does not handle case insensitivity properly, leading to test failures when comparing table names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the issue with the failing test cases mentioned in the GitHub issue. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and handle case sensitivity properly in Hive table existence checks.
