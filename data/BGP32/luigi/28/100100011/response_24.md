### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names when doing the comparison. The failing test is checking for table existence based on different cases of table names, and the function is not handling this properly.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison of the table name with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. 

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function is directly comparing the table name with the stdout without taking into account any case sensitivity, causing the test cases with different table name cases to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and allow the function to correctly determine if a table exists regardless of the case of the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding case insensitivity in table existence checks.
