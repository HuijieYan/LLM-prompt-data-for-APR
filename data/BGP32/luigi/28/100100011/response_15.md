## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `contrib/hive.py` file is not handling the case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` is designed to test this functionality but currently fails due to case sensitivity issues.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists.
2. The comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is not case insensitive.
3. The function does not account for the table names being returned in lowercase by Hive.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the lack of case insensitivity handling in the `table_exists` function. Hive returns table names in lower case, leading to failures when comparing them with the input table name in the function. This discrepancy causes the failing test cases in `hive_test.py`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to convert both the input table name and the Hive output table names to lowercase before comparing them. By doing this, we can ensure case insensitivity during the table existence check, enabling the function to correctly identify tables regardless of their case.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

In the corrected version, both the input `table` and the `stdout` from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison. This modification ensures case insensitivity, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
