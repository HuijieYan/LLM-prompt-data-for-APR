## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in Hive, optionally in a specified database and partition.
- The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where table names are case-sensitive in the code but are returned as lowercase by Hive, causing test failures.
- The failing test checks for both case-sensitive and case-insensitive scenarios, revealing the bug in handling table names.
- The function currently compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The comparison between the `table` and `stdout` values does not account for case differences.
- The return logic based on the presence of stdout might not handle all scenarios properly.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the direct comparison between the `table` name provided to the function and the table names retrieved from Hive, which are lowercase.
- This leads to inconsistent behavior where the function fails when checking for tables with mixed cases.
  
## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison to make the check case insensitive.
2. Update the return logic to include the case-insensitive comparison to determine if a table exists.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before the comparison, the corrected function now handles the case sensitivity issue identified in the GitHub issue.
