### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a database. The function determines table existence based on the output of a Hive command.
2. The bug occurs in the function due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the retrieved output.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function with different scenarios including case sensitivity.
4. The bug is confirmed to be caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command.
5. To resolve the bug, a case-insensitive comparison should be applied when checking if the table name exists in the Hive command output.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function to compare the lowercased versions of the table name and the output from the Hive command, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue stated in GitHub. This correction allows the `table_exists` function to pass the failing test scenarios related to case sensitivity.
