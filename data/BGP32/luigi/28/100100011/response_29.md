## Analysis:
- The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
- The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing table names.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` demonstrates the issue where table names are not being compared in a case-insensitive manner.
- The GitHub issue titled `hive table_exists should be case insensitive?` and `Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive` provide additional context and suggest a solution to make the comparison case-insensitive.

## Error Locations:
- The error occurs in the condition where the table name is checked against the output.
- The comparison should take into account case-insensitivity to handle different cases of table names.

## Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing table names in the `table_exists` function, leading to test failures for table names with different cases.
- Hive is case-insensitive, so the table names should be compared case-insensitively to ensure correct behavior.
- The failing test cases in the test function highlight the issue and the need for a case-insensitive comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
- By using case-insensitive checks, the function will work correctly for table names regardless of their case.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.
