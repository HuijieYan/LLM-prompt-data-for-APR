## Correction:

Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing table names. The function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity properly, leading to failing tests when table names are not in the correct case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to make it case-insensitive when comparing the table names in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert all table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them with the lowercase version of the table name in the `table` variable.

This modification makes the comparison case-insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub issue and ensuring that the failing test for case sensitivity passes.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases.
