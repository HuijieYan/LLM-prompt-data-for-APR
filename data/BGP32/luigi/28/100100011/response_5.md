To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the check. This change will ensure that the function can correctly identify tables regardless of their case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase versions of both the table name and the stdout, we ensure that the function can pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub discussions (#896). This change makes the function case-insensitive and should resolve the reported bug.
