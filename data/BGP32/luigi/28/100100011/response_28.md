### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not handling case sensitivity properly. The issue raised on GitHub indicates that the table_exists function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. In the if block of the `table_exists` function, comparison of the table name with the output is case sensitive.
2. The same case sensitivity issue exists in the else block of the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function only checks for an exact match of the table name, leading to test failures when the case of the table name does not match the case in the Hive output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the function can correctly identify table existence regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version, the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking table existence in Hive, resolving the issue raised on GitHub. Now, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and handle case insensitivity correctly.
