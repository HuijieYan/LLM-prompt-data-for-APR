### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not handling case sensitivity correctly, as indicated by the failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`. The issue on GitHub also confirms that this is a known problem and suggests a fix to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. The comparison of `table` with `stdout` is case sensitive.
2. The `table` parameter is not transformed to lowercase before comparison.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. Due to case differences, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, implement a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the `table` parameter and the output from Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        # Case-insensitive comparison
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Case-insensitive comparison
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive and ensuring that both the `table` and the output are converted to lowercase, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
