### Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `SHOW TABLES` or `SHOW PARTITIONS` command in Hive.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output obtained from Hive commands. This leads to incorrect results when checking if a table exists, especially when the case of the table name does not match the case of the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output obtained from Hive commands. We can convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# this is the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()  # Convert table name to lowercase
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table_lower in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
- We convert the `table` name to lowercase using `table_lower = table.lower()`.
- We perform a case-insensitive check by converting both the `table` name and the entries in `stdout` to lowercase using `map(str.lower, ...)`.
- We compare the lowercase `table` name with the lowercase entries in `stdout` to determine if the table exists.

By making these modifications, the function should now be able to correctly check for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner as suggested in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
