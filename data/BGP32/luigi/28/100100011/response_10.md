Based on the information provided in the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue. The function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and can correctly determine if the table exists in Hive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue of case sensitivity mentioned in the GitHub issue.
