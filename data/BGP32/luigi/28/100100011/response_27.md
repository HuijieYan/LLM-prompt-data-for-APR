## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue reported in GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive due to differences in table naming conventions between uppercase and lowercase in Hive.

The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function in various scenarios, including case sensitivity.

## Bug Locations:
1. The function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for a table's existence.
2. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase for comparison with the output from Hive.

## Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the fact that the `table_exists` function does not consider the case insensitivity of table names in Hive. Therefore, when comparing the table name provided by the user with the actual table name in Hive, it fails in cases where there is a case mismatch.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing with the output from Hive.
2. Ensure that the comparison is done using lowercase table names to make it case insensitive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and Hive table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will become case insensitive and address the issue reported in GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the case insensitivity problem.
