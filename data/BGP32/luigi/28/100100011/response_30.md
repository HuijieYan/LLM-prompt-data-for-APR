## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the `luigi/contrib` directory has a bug that causes it to fail the test cases related to table existence checks.

2. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity properly when comparing the table name obtained from the Hive commands with the table name provided as input.

3. The failing test cases demonstrate that when the table name is provided in different cases (e.g., "mytable" vs. "MyTable"), the function fails to correctly identify the table existence due to case mismatch.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case insensitive, allowing for correct identification of table existence regardless of the case used in the input.

## Correction:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name when checking for table existence in the Hive commands' output, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This correction aligns with the suggested fix in GitHub issue #896.
