After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, the main issue is that the `table_exists` function is case sensitive, causing failures when comparing table names. The issue in GitHub suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking both the table name and the output in lowercase.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive and can correctly identify table existence regardless of the case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now be case insensitive and pass the failing test cases mentioned in the GitHub issue.
