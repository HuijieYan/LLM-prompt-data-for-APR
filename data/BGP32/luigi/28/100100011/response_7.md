Looking at the provided buggy function `table_exists` and the failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py`, the issue seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The failing test cases such as `test_table_exists` are failing because the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly.

The bug occurs because when comparing the table name with the output received from Hive, the function is not handling the case sensitivity properly. For example, when the table name is "mytable" but Hive returns "MyTable", the comparison fails due to case mismatch.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. Both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them in a case-insensitive manner.
2. The return condition for the case where `partition is None` has been updated to correctly check if the table exists in the stdout.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue of case sensitivity mentioned in the GitHub issue.
