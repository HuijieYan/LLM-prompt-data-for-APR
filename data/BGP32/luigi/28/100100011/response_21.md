## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file has a logic issue where it fails to handle case insensitivity. The problem arises when checking if a table exists in the database, as the function compares the table names directly without considering case differences.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity.
2. Incorrect handling of partitioned tables.
3. Inadequate return value handling from `run_hive_cmd`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence due to case mismatch. The function does not consider that Hive is case insensitive, leading to failures when comparing table names with different cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the input table name and the received table names from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this correction, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive, resolving the issue described in GitHub and ensuring that the test cases pass successfully.
