The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The test cases are failing because the function does not account for case differences in table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By performing case-insensitive comparisons in the corrected function, it should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub. The corrected function ensures that the table name is converted to lowercase before checking its existence in the output from Hive.
