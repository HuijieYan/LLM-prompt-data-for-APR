The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison between the table name and the output obtained from Hive. This comparison does not take into account case insensitivity, leading to test failures when the casing of the table name does not match the casing of the output from Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for a match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case sensitivity issues and should pass the failing test cases provided.
