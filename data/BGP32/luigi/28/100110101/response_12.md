#### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks the existence of a table. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a command and then checks whether the table exists based on the output. However, the logic within the function is incorrect, leading to failures in the test cases.

1. In the first case, the function should return `True` if the table exists in the stdout output, but the current implementation uses an 'and' condition which doesn't handle this check correctly.

2. In the second case, the function should return `True` if the table exists in the stdout output, but the logic doesn't correctly account for this condition.

3. In the third case, when checking for the existence of a table with a partition, the logic to check stdout is incorrect and does not account for the correct comparison.

4. The function does not properly handle the case when there is no stdout or an empty string as output in the last two cases.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, the logic for checking the existence of the table based on the stdout output should be corrected. The function needs to compare the table name in the stdout to determine if the table exists. Additionally, handling empty or no stdout cases should also be addressed.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_condition))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In this corrected version:
1. In the first case, the function checks if the table name exists in the `stdout` directly, returning `True` if found.
2. In the second case, a correct check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` is implemented.
3. In the third case, the function handles the partition condition comparison correctly with `self.partition_spec(partition)`.
4. The function now handles the cases of empty or no stdout properly by returning `bool(stdout)` which correctly handles truthiness.
