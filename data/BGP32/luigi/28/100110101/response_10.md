### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database with an optional partition condition.
2. In the `if partition is None` block, the query is constructed to check for table existence without a partition condition.
3. In the `else` block, the query is constructed to check for table existence with a partition condition.
4. The bug seems to be that the function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.
5. The failing tests are checking for table existence and handling case sensitivity issues as well.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is only checking if the `stdout` variable is a truthy value to determine if the table exists, which is causing incorrect evaluations.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table name is present in the output for table existence validation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return 'OK' in stdout
``` 

By checking if `'OK'` is present in the `stdout`, the function will accurately determine if the table exists. This corrected version should pass all the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
