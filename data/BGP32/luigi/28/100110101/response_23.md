### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with the comparison logic in both branches of the `if` condition. The function checks if the `stdout` contains the table name, but the comparison logic is incorrect. When `stdout` is not empty, the buggy function returns False instead of True.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` but returns the opposite of what is expected.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison logic in the function to return True when the table is found in `stdout` and False when it is not found.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout
```

By updating the comparison logic to check if the table is in the `stdout` and directly returning the value of `stdout` in the else branch, we ensure that the function works correctly based on the expected behavior.

The corrected `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
