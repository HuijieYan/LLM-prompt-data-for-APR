### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a given table exists in a database, with an optional partition condition.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the expected table existence based on the returned value from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not returning the expected results for table existence checks.
4. The bug could be due to incorrect comparison logic or parsing of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function correctly, leading to incorrect comparisons of the table existence status.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes the output from `run_hive_cmd` and compares it to determine the table existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the function to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and using `bool(stdout)` instead of direct comparisons, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
