### Analysis:
The buggy function, `table_exists`, has two main branches based on whether a partition is provided or not. In the first branch, it runs a Hive command to check if a table exists by showing tables like the input table name. In the second branch, it runs a different Hive command to check the existence of a specific partition for the table.

The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the stdout response from the Hive commands in both branches. The buggy function does not correctly evaluate the presence of the table or partition based on the stdout response.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue might be related to how the function processes the stdout variable after running the Hive commands. It compares `stdout` directly but does not handle cases where the table or partition might appear in the stdout with other text.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not correctly parsing and validating the output from the Hive command. The incorrect evaluation of the stdout variable leads to incorrect results in determining the existence of the table or partition.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Parse the `stdout` response from the Hive command to extract the relevant table names or partitions.
2. Check if the provided table or partition exists in the extracted information.
3. Update the return logic based on the correct evaluation of the table/partition existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n') if stdout else []
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n') if stdout else []
        return any(partition in partitions for partition in self.partition_spec(partition))
```

Now the corrected version of the function should correctly parse the stdout response and validate the existence of the table or partition based on the extracted information. This should ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and satisfies the expected input/output values.
