### Bug Fix

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the return value is being checked. The function is expected to return `True` only when the table exists in the stdout. However, the existing implementation is returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which is problematic because an empty string (stdout) would be considered as False and lead to incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is in stdout only without considering the truthiness of stdout. We should also make sure to consider case insensitivity when comparing table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table.lower() in stdout.lower() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will ensure that the function behaves correctly for all the provided test cases.
