The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statement that checks for the existence of the table. The function is not handling the case where the table name is in the output string but is not the only content. It simply checks if the table name is in the string without considering other potential content. This leads to incorrect evaluation in some test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional in the function to check for exact matches of the table name in the output string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version compares the stripped `stdout` string directly with the provided `table` name for an exact match. Additionally, the function always returns a boolean value based on the existence of `stdout`.

By making this change, the function should now pass all the failing test cases with the expected input/output values as described.
