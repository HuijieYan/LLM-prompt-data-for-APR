### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because of the inconsistency between the expected output and the actual behavior of the function. The function is supposed to query the hive table and return `True` if it exists and `False` if it doesn't. However, due to incorrect parsing of stdout from the hive command, the function is returning the opposite results.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of how the function handles the stdout from the hive commands. In the first part where the partition is `None`, the function checks if the table is in the `stdout` and returns the result. In the second part where the partition is provided, it checks if `stdout` is not empty and then returns `True`, hence the discrepancy.

### Fix:
We need to correct the conditional checks in the function so that it returns `True` only if the table exists in the `stdout`.
- Modify the condition to check if the table is in the `stdout` for both cases.
- Adjust the return values based on the check results.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now return the expected outcomes for the test cases.
