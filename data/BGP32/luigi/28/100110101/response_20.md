The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how it checks for the presence of a table or partition in Hive. The bug lies in the condition checking process, where the function does not correctly validate the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The issue arises from the fact that the function expects the presence of the table or partition name in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, but it does not properly handle cases where the output is not an exact match. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check for the existence of the table or partition name within it.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")  # Check if table is in the output

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(partition_name in stdout for partition_name in partition.values())  # Check if partition exists

```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the output from `run_hive_cmd` and checks for the existence of the table or partition name. This correction should make the function pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
