### Bug identification and explanation
The buggy function `table_exists` has two branches: one for when `partition` is `None`, and one for when it is not `None`. In the case where `partition` is `None`, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists. However, the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command is incorrect, leading to incorrect return values.

### Bug fix strategy
The incorrect comparison happens when checking if the table name is in the stdout from the Hive command. To fix this, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly handle the stdout format. We should split the stdout into lines and then do the comparison with the table name.

### Corrected function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

After updating the function with the corrected comparison logic, it should pass all the failing test cases mentioned.
