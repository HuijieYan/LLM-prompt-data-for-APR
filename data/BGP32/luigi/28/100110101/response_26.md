The bug in the provided function lies in the condition check for the presence of the table in the output of the Hive command. The function incorrectly checks for the presence of the whole table name instead of checking if the table name is included in the output line.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for the presence of the table name in the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(table in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

In the corrected version:
1. In the first case, we check if the table name exists in each line of the command output instead of checking for the whole table name presence in the output.
2. In the second case with partition, we split the command output lines and iterate over them to check if the table name is present in any line. This ensures that we correctly verify the table's existence in the partitioned output.

This corrected version should now pass all the provided failing test cases and match the expected input/output values.
