1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database. It runs a Hive command based on whether a partition is provided or not.

2. The potential error in the function lies in the condition when checking if the table is present in the output. The function returns True only if the table is found in the output string, leading to incorrect results when handling the output with multiple lines.

3. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks if the table name specifically matches the entire string in stdout. When multiple tables are listed in the output, it returns False as it does not find an exact match.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is present in the output line by line. This way, we can accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
