### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has issues with the logic inside the if conditions. The function returns a boolean value based on whether the table exists in the database or not. However, the conditions for checking the existence of the table are incorrect, leading to failing test cases.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition to check if the table exists:
   - In the first case, the function checks if the table name is present in the stdout received from the `run_hive_cmd`, which should indicate a successful table existence.
   - In the second case, it is trying to check if the stdout is not empty, which might not be a reliable way to determine table existence.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect logic in checking the table existence in the buggy function. In the failing test cases, the function does not handle the conditions correctly, leading to incorrect return values and failing assertions.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the if conditions to accurately determine table existence based on the stdout received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Ensure that the function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not, as expected by the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the conditions to check if the table name is in the stdout in the first case, and checking if the stdout is not empty in the second case, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected boolean results for table existence.
