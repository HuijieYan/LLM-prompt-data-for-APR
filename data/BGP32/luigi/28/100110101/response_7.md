## Analysis
The buggy function has an issue with the handling of the `table_exists` method. It fails to properly check if the table exists based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Identified Bug
The bug lies in the condition to check the existence of the table within the `stdout` variable. The function is returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which is problematic as it would only return `True` if both conditions are met, but the expected behavior is to return `True` if the table is found in the `stdout`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the table exists in the output string `stdout`. We should check if the `table` is in the `stdout` string directly and return `True` if it is, instead of relying on the truthiness of both `stdout` and the table in `stdout`.

## Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```
