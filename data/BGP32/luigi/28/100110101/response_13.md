### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` has conditional logic to check if a partition is provided or not.
2. The bug is likely due to incorrect checking of the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results based on the presence of table names in the output.
4. We need to modify the condition to correctly check if the table name is present in the output string.
5. We should also consider case insensitivity for table name comparison.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(line.strip().lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n') if line.strip())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This correction ensures that the function correctly checks for the presence of the table name in the output without considering case sensitivity. This corrected version should pass all the provided test cases.
