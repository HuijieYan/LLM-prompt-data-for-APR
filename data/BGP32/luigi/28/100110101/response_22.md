The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition used to check if a table exists in the Hive database. The function is not correctly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic to check if the table name is present in the output string obtained from `run_hive_cmd`. Let's correct the function to address this issue.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})')
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In this corrected version:
- For the case without partition, we check if the table name is in the output string.
- For the case with partition, we use the `partition_spec` method to get the partition string and then check if the output from `run_hive_cmd` is not empty.

This corrected version should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
