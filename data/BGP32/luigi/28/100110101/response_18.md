### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` receives parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`. It utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to perform a Hive query and then checks the stdout for table existence.
2. The bug seems to be in the conditional check for `stdout` after running the Hive command. The function wrongly returns based on the value in `stdout` without processing it correctly.
3. The failing test cases expect the function to correctly determine the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive commands. However, the function is not handling the stdout properly, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function parses the output from the `run_hive_cmd` correctly to determine table existence.
5. The corrected function should handle the stdout appropriately, comparing it with the table name to accurately ascertain table existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return bool(partitions)
```

By splitting the stdout on newlines and then checking for the table presence within the extracted list of tables or partitions, we ensure a more accurate detection of table existence.

This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing tests.
