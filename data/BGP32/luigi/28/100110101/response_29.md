### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `hive.py` file checks if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug appears to be related to how the stdout response from `run_hive_cmd` is handled in the function. It checks if a table is present in the stdout response but does not consider the formatting of the response.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not accurately identifying the existence of tables due to formatting issues in the stdout responses.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle the stdout responses and accurately determine if a table exists in a given database.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle the stdout responses more accurately.
2. Consider the formatting of the responses to determine table existence.
3. Update the function to return `True` only if the table is found in the stdout response, otherwise return `False`.
4. Ensure that the function handles cases where the table names are present in a formatted string.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout response on newline characters and checking if the table name is present in the resulting list, we can accurately determine if a table exists in the database. This approach ensures that the function handles different stdout formats and returns the correct boolean value based on table existence.
