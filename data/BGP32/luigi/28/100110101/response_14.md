### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with the comparison logic on whether a table exists in the database. The function checks if the table name is present in the output of a command run on the Hive database, but the comparison is not handled correctly causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function returns True if the `stdout` variable is not empty, but it should actually return True only when the table name is present in the `stdout`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable correctly.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                               ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""  # Checking if stdout is not empty
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable by newline characters and checking if the table name exists within the lines, we can ensure correct behavior for the function. Additionally, the comparison for the partition case has been updated to check if `stdout` is not empty.
