## Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the way the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness in the `if` conditions. The function is returning `stdout and table in stdout`, which evaluates to `True` when `stdout` is not empty but does not necessarily contain the table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `stdout` variable is checked and return the correct output based on the presence of the table name in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation of the correction:
- In the first `if` condition, we split the `stdout` by line breaks using `split("\n")`. Then we check if the `table` name is present in the list of tables obtained from `stdout`. This ensures that we correctly identify if the table exists.
- In the second condition, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout` to check if it is empty or not.

By making these modifications, the corrected function should now pass all the test cases with the expected input/output values defined.
