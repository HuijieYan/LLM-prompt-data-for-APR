### Analysis:
The buggy function has two main branches based on whether `partition` is `None` or not. In the first branch, it runs a Hive command to check if a table exists in a database. In the second branch, it runs a Hive command to check if a partition exists in a table.

From the failing test, it is evident that the first branch is not handling the case when the table name is present in the `stdout` variable correctly. The function should return `True` if the table is found in the `stdout` and `False` otherwise.

### Bug:
In the first branch of the `if` statement, the buggy function is not parsing the `stdout` variable correctly to determine if the table exists. It only checks if the `stdout` variable exists and if the `table` is in `stdout`. This approach doesn't handle cases where there is additional text in the `stdout`. For example, when `stdout` is `"OK\nmytable"`, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

### Correction:
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the `stdout` variable to check if the `table` exists within the text. We can split the `stdout` variable into lines and check if the `table` exists in any of these lines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" 
                             % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` variable by newline character (`\n`), we can properly check if the `table` exists in the output. This corrected version of the function should pass all the failing tests and handle the case where extra text is present in the `stdout` variable.
