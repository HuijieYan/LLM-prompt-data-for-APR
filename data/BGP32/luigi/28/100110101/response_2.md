## Correction:

The issue in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the returned stdout with the table name. The function does not handle the case where the table name is followed by a newline character, which causes the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the table name is present in the lines of stdout rather than a direct string comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable on the newline character `\n` and then checking if the table name is present in the lines, we ensure a correct comparison and fix the bug.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
