### Identified Bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This leads to failing test cases where the table name has different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of the table name with the values returned from Hive queries without considering case sensitivity. The test cases expect the function to be case-insensitive when checking for table existence, but the function is currently case-sensitive.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the values returned from Hive queries to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure a consistent and case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive through converting both the table name and the returned values to lowercase, the corrected version of the function ensures consistent behavior in verifying the existence of tables in Hive. This modification resolves the failing test cases mentioned in the GitHub issues.
