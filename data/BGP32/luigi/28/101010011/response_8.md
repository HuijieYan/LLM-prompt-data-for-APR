### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the test cases to fail due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive.

### Identified Issue:
The `table_exists` function currently compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity. This results in test failures when dealing with tables having different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The `table_exists` function directly compares the provided table name with the tables listed in Hive, leading to case sensitivity issues.
- The test cases fail because the function does not handle case differences between the given table name and the actual table names in Hive.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names case-insensitively. By converting both the provided table name and the Hive table names to lowercase, we can perform a case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with case-insensitive table name comparison:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the provided table name and the Hive table names are converted to lowercase using `lower()`.
- The comparison now checks if the lowercase table name exists in the lowercase output from Hive.
- The function returns `True` when stdout is not empty, indicating the presence of the table.

This fix ensures that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive, resolving the failing test cases.
