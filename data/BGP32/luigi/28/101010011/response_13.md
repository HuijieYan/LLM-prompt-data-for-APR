### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. The issue arises due to case sensitivity in string comparison.
   
2. The potential error location is the comparison between the table name and the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from a case sensitivity problem in the function `table_exists`. The comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function does not account for case differences. This leads to failing tests as the comparison is strict.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the comparison case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic to convert both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the failing tests.
