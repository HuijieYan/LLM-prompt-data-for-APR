### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expected to check if a table exists in the specified database. The issue arises due to case sensitivity, as the function is comparing the table name directly instead of checking in a case-insensitive manner.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function does not handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to match hive behavior accurately.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison part to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` performing a case-sensitive check on the table name against the output from the hive command. Hive is case insensitive but returns table names in lowercase. Therefore, the direct comparison results in false negatives when checking table existence.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check for the table name against the hive output. By converting both the table name and the hive output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the hive output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.
