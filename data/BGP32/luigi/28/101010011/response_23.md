### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to retrieve information about tables in a database. The function checks if the table exists by comparing the table name in the `stdout` output.
2. The failing tests indicate that the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` is case sensitive, leading to a test failure when the case of the table name differs.
3. The related GitHub issue (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address this issue.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` should be performed in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout`. When the table names have different cases, the comparison fails, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` to be case insensitive. We can convert both the table name and the `stdout` content to lower case before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Converted both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- Simplified the return statement in the `else` block to directly return a boolean value based on `stdout` presence.

By making the comparison case insensitive, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised in GitHub.
