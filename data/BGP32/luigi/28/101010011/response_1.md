### Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in the specified database with optional partition information. The issue arises when comparing the expected table name against the table names retrieved from the Hive command output. This leads to a case sensitivity problem, causing the test cases to fail.

### Identify potential error locations

The potential error location is within the comparison logic where the table names are checked against the stdout from the Hive commands. The case sensitivity of the comparison is causing the test failures.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name provided (e.g., "MyTable") against the table names retrieved from Hive commands (which are in lowercase). This difference in case leads to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not, causing the test cases to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function should be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the expected table name and the table names retrieved from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison. By ensuring case insensitivity, the function will accurately determine if the table exists regardless of the case provided in the input.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the expected table name (`table.lower()`) and the table names retrieved from stdout from Hive commands (`stdout.lower()`) are converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue causing the test failures.
