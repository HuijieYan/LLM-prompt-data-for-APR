### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case sensitive.
2. Lack of handling case insensitivity in the comparison for table names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The comparison `table in stdout` is case sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when the table name has a different case in the database compared to the provided table name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This change ensures that the comparison is now case-insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the failing test cases.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of tables in the Hive database.
