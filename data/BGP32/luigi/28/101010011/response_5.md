### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in the database by querying hive and comparing the output with the table name. The issue arises when the table names have different cases, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.
2. The error is occurring when the capitalization of the table name is not consistent with the case in the output from Hive, causing the comparisons to fail.
3. The bug is caused by the inconsistency in case sensitivity between the table name provided and the output from the Hive query. The issue raised on GitHub (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve this problem. The current implementation directly compares the table name and the output from Hive, which fails if the cases differ.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison should be case insensitive. One approach is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them in the `table_exists` function.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This makes the comparison case insensitive and ensures that table existence checks are accurate regardless of the case of the table names.

By implementing this fix, the test cases will no longer fail due to case differences in the table names, resolving the issue reported on GitHub (#896) and ensuring the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.
