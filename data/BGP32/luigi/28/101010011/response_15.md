### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` in the `if` condition.
2. The comparison `table, self.partition_spec(partition)` in the `run_hive_cmd` command string.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The `table_exists` function compares the table name to the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which can be in a different case. If the table name is in a different case compared to the output, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results.

The failing test cases are failing because the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison without considering the case of the table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive, which will resolve the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issues.
