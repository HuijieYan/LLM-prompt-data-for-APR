## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue arises from case sensitivity in comparing the table name returned from the Hive command with the input table name.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing when checking for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity.
3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the table names returned by Hive commands is case-sensitive. As a result, the comparison fails when the casing does not match, leading to the assertion error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the table names returned by Hive commands to a consistent case before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is displayed below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the comparison for table existence will be case insensitive, resolving the failed test cases related to table name matching in the test scenarios described in the GitHub issue.
