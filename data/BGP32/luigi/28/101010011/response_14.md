### **Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database. 
2. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The failing test indicates that the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence.
4. The related GitHub issue #896 suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by checking against lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive commands.
5. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when checking table existence due to case mismatch issues.

### **Bug Cause:**
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a lack of case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output from Hive commands. The function does not account for case differences, leading to false positives or negatives when determining table existence.

### **Bug Fix Strategy:**
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive commands. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure consistent behavior regardless of case differences.

### **Corrected Version:**
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive in the corrected version, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle cases where the table name and the output from Hive commands differ in case. This modification addresses the issue reported in GitHub and ensures accurate table existence checks.
