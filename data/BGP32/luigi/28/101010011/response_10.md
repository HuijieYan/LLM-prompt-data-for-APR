Based on the error messages and the GitHub issues provided, it is clear that the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is case-sensitive and needs to be made case-insensitive in order to pass the tests.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Comparing the table name directly without converting it to lowercase can cause case sensitivity issues.
2. Checking for exact match between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This results in failing tests due to mismatched case.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` should be performed in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version of the function will be case-insensitive and should pass the failing tests.
