1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is meant to check if a specified table exists in a given database and handle cases where the table names might have different cases. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are the comparisons between the table name and the results obtained from running Hive commands.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function `table_exists` is directly comparing the table name with the output obtained from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false results when the case of the table name differs from the case of the output retrieved from Hive.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison check to make it case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` before the comparison, we ensure that the function correctly handles case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the database.
