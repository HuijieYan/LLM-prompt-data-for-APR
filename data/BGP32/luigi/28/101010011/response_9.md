### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a given table exists in Hive. The issue arises when the table name in Hive is case sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for table existence.
2. The issue is related to the comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner.
3. The cause of the bug is evident in the failing test cases where the expected table names are not matching the actual table names due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the result from Hive to lowercase before the comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison to check for table existence in Hive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % 
                              (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This correction will resolve the failing test cases caused by case sensitivity issues.
