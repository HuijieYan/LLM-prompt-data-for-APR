### Analyzing the Buggy Function

- The buggy function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is `table_exists`.
- It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute SQL commands.
- The error message indicates that the function is failing when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity issues.
- The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive due to changes in behavior.

### Error Locations in the Buggy Function

- The issue arises when checking if the table is in the output of the SQL command.
- The comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` is case sensitive.

### Cause of the Bug

- The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout`.
- Hive is case insensitive, so the table name in `stdout` might be in a different case than what was provided.
- The test cases fail because they expect a case-sensitive match between the provided table name and the retrieved table name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

- To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` needs to be made case insensitive.
- Convert both the provided table name and the retrieved table name to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation of the Correction

- In the corrected version, both the provided table name (`table.lower()`) and the retrieved table names (`stdout.lower()`) are converted to lowercase before comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, aligning with the behavior of Hive.
- The correction addresses the case sensitivity issue that was causing the test cases to fail.
