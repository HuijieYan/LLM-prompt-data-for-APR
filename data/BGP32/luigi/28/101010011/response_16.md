### Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases related to table existence due to case sensitivity issues. The function is not handling the case where the table name returned by `run_hive_cmd` may have a different case than the one being checked for existence.

### Error Location

The error is likely occurring in the comparison between the `table` name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of comparing the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`. If the table name is in a different case in the Hive logs, the comparison fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to compare the table name in lowercase with the output of `run_hive_cmd` converted to lowercase as well. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the output of `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive.
