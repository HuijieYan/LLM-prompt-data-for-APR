### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions:
The buggy function `table_exists` is within the `HiveCommandClient` class, and it makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is case sensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The bug is likely caused by a case sensitivity issue in comparing the table name obtained from Hive with the table name provided as input to the function.

### Explaining the cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the function is performing a direct comparison between the provided table name and the table name obtained from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to the test failing when the case of the table names does not match.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the provided table name and the table name obtained from Hive to a consistent case (e.g., lower case or upper case) before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table name obtained from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case insensitive.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and address the issue raised on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
