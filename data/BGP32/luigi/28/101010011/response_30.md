### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises from a case sensitivity problem where the table name provided might not match the case of the table name returned from the Hive query.

### Potential Error Locations

1. Comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner.
2. Lack of handling case insensitivity for table existence check.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the comparison of the expected table name with the table names returned from the Hive query without considering case sensitivity. Hive is case insensitive, causing discrepancies when comparing the table names. This results in the test failures as observed in the error messages.

### Bug Fixing Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. By converting both the expected table name and the table names from the Hive query to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the check is consistent and successful.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of the table. This modification aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue discussions and fixes the bug reported in the failing tests.
