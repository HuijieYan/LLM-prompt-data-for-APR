### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `table` and `stdout` in the `table_exists` function could lead to case sensitivity issues.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function `table_exists` is not handling case insensitivity properly when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the function `table_exists` checking for table existence without considering case sensitivity. The failing test cases indicate that the function is failing to detect the tables due to case differences in the table name and the returned `stdout`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive:
1. Convert both `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function to ensure a successful table existence check regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- Both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- The `stdout` is checked directly for truthiness to simplify the condition.
- The function now handles case-insensitive table existence checks, resolving the failing test cases related to issue #896.
