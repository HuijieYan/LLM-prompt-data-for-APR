### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database, but the comparison is case-sensitive.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly.
3. The related GitHub issue (#896) highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
4. The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name without considering case differences.
   
### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the returned stdout to lower case during comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing tests.
