### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity. The issue reported on GitHub mentions the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the lowercase version of the table against the lowercase version of the output string.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, without considering case differences. This leads to test failures when the case of the table name and the output string do not match.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly for tables with different cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparing them, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity correctly. This change aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
