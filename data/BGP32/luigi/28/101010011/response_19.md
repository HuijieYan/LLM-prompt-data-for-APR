### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not performing a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the table existence check is failing due to case sensitivity.
3. The GitHub issue raised highlights the importance of making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid issues with table names in different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to use case-insensitive checks.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to check if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Ensure that the comparison is case insensitive to handle table names in different cases correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the comparison to check if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the lowercase version of the output.
- Ensured that the comparison is now case insensitive.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
