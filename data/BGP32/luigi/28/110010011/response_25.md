### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case insensitivity appropriately when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The failing tests are checking for table existence with different cases (`mytable`, `MyTable`) but the function is not case insensitive.
3. The error message clearly states that `False is not true` which indicates the bug is related to case sensitivity.
4. The GitHub issue provides information that the function should be made case insensitive to resolve the problem.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function directly compares the provided table name with the output from Hive without considering case differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function now handles case insensitivity properly. This modification will ensure that the function passes the failing tests and resolves the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
