### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name against the output from the Hive command.
2. The issue originates from the fact that the function doesn't convert both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase for comparison.
3. The failing test is expecting a case-insensitive comparison but is failing because the function does not perform case normalization.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not convert the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase, leading to case-sensitive comparison issues.

### Fix Strategy:
Normalize the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before comparison to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

By normalizing both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase during comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive comparison. This corrected version should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
