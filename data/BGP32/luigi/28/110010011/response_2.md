### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
2. The test cases are checking for table existence, but due to case sensitivity issues, the tests are failing.
3. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results when checking if a table exists in the database. The bug arises from the comparison of table names where the case needs to be considered.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the output from `run_hive_cmd` with the provided table name. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should also be case insensitive to determine the existence of the table accurately.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the provided table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output.
2. Update the code to handle case insensitivity by considering lowercasing both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the provided table name is converted to lowercase before checking if it exists in the stdout obtained from `run_hive_cmd`. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the bug causing the failing test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
