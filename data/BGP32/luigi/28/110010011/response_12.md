### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `HiveContrib` module of Luigi.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is case sensitive when checking for the existence of a table.
3. The bug causes the test to fail when checking for table existence using a different letter case than what is returned by the hive command. For example, `mytable` is not considered equal to `myTable`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before checking for equality.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
