### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `hive.py` file is not handling case insensitivity. The function compares the table name with the tables returned by the hive command without considering case differences, leading to failing test cases due to case sensitivity.

### Identified Error Location:
The error lies in how the function compares the table name with the tables returned by the hive command without handling case insensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not consider case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the tables returned by the hive command. Thus, when the table names have different cases, the comparison fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function by converting the table names to lowercase before comparison with the tables returned by the hive command. This will ensure case insensitivity in the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Making the comparison case insensitive
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the tables returned by the hive command to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly when dealing with table names that have different cases.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
