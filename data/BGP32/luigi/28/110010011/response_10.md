### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly. The function should compare the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output from the query to ensure case-insensitive comparison.

The failing test is checking for table existence with different cases of the table name. The current implementation of the function does not handle this case properly, leading to test failures.

The GitHub issue (#896) and the related description highlight the issue with case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function and suggest a solution by checking the lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when comparing the table name `mytable` with the output from the command, leading to case sensitivity issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case sensitivity correctly. When comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, the function does not consider the case of the table names. This results in test failures when checking for table existence with different cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the query. This approach will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the test failures.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout.lower() != 'table not found'
```

In the corrected version:
- Convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
- Check if the lowercase table name exists in the lowercase stdout when partition is `None`.
- Check if the lowercase stdout is not `'table not found'` for partitioned tables.

By making these changes, the function will handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing tests.
