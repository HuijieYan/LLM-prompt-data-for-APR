### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is currently case sensitive.
2. The failing test cases are checking for table existence in a case insensitive manner, leading to assertion errors.
3. The error occurs because the `table_exists` function compares the table names directly without considering case sensitivity, which causes the tests to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.
5. By making the comparison case insensitive, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence. This correction aligns with the intended behavior described in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
