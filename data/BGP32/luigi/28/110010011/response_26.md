## Analyzing the buggy function

In the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, there is a bug that causes the function to be case-sensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The bug stems from comparing the table name with the stdout without considering the case sensitivity of the strings.

The failing test is due to the fact that the test is trying to check the existence of a table named "MyTable" using a case-insensitive comparison, which is currently not supported by the buggy implementation.

The related GitHub issue (#896) highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive when checking for table existence due to the case sensitivity of Hive. The suggested fix is to compare the table name with stdout after converting both to lowercase.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly irrespective of the case used for the table name.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This modification ensures that the function is case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

By applying this fix, the function will now pass the failing test and align with the expectation of a case-insensitive comparison for table existence in Hive.
