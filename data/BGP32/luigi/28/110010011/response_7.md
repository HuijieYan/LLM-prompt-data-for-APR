### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to properly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The failing test cases are failing due to case sensitivity issues between the table name and the output from Hive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison operation between the table name and the output from Hive may not be handling case sensitivity correctly.
2. The way the table name is compared with the output from Hive might not be accurate.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `table_exists` function to fail when checking for the existence of a table due to case sensitivity issues. Hive is case insensitive, so when comparing the provided table name with the output from Hive, the function does not handle case differences correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can avoid case sensitivity issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification will fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases related to case sensitivity.
