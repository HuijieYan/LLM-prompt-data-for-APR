1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
   - The error message indicates that the test cases are failing because the function is case-sensitive when checking for existing tables.
   - The GitHub issue (#896) points out that the function `table_exists` should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The function compares the table name against the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

3. Bug cause:
   - The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, which can have different cases due to Hive being case-insensitive. This leads to false negatives in the test cases.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and fix the failing test cases.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now ensures that the table existence check is case-insensitive, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue #896.
