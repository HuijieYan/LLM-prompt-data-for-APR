### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case insensitivity properly when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The error message from the failing test indicates that the test is expecting case insensitivity behavior, but the current implementation does not provide that.

The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive to handle scenarios where table names are defined with different cases in Hive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the content of `stdout` is done without considering case insensitivity.
2. The function does not handle variations in case for table names.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the function compares the exact table name to the content of `stdout`, without taking into account the casing of the table name. When the table name casing mismatches with the output from Hive, the comparison fails, leading to test failures.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will handle scenarios where table names are defined with different cases.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case insensitivity correctly. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
