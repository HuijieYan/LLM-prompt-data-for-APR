### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to case sensitivity problems.
   
2. The potential error locations are where the comparison between the table name and the command output is being performed.

3. The cause of the bug is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. If the table name and the output have different cases, the comparison fails, resulting in the test failures observed in the error messages. The GitHub issue identifies the root cause and provides a solution by suggesting to check against the lowercase table name.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in case.

### Recommended Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing.
2. Update the comparison statements to check for lowercase versions of the table name in the lowercase output.
3. This approach will make the comparison case insensitive, resolving the issue identified in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function will pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
