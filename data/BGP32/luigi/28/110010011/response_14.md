### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `table_exists` function in `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. **Relation with Buggy Class**: The function is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class.
3. **Error Message**: The error message indicates an assertion failure stating that `False` is not `True`.
4. **GitHub Issue**:
   - **Title**: hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
   - **Description**: Indicates that table names may have different case in Hive and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking against lowercase table names.

### Identification of Error:
Potential errors occur in comparing the table name with the output from Hive as it may differ in case sensitivity causing the tests to fail.

### Explanation of Bug:
The bug arises because the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison of the table name with the output of Hive commands without considering case sensitivity. Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail and leading to incorrect results in tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before the comparison in the `table_exists` function, the bug causing the test failures due to case sensitivity issues should be resolved.
