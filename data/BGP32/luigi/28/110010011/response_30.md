### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing assertions to fail.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not handling case sensitivity correctly. The function compares the provided table name directly with the result from the Hive query, which may not match due to case differences.

### Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version includes the conversion of both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This fix addresses the issue reported in the failing test cases.
