### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class which is a part of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
2. The error occurs when the function does not handle case insensitivity properly when checking for table existence.
3. The error message indicates that the test fails because the function does not account for case insensitivity correctly.
4. The GitHub issues suggest that the function should be modified to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case insensitivity properly. The function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, leading to a case-sensitive check which results in test failures.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence, fixing the bug and resolving the GitHub issue.
