### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
2. The function is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database but is not handling case sensitivity correctly.
3. The error message indicates that the test case fails due to case sensitivity when checking table existence. The issue on GitHub also confirms that the function should be case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### The corrected version of the function:
- Converts the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make them case insensitive.
- Simplifies the return statement for the `stdout` check without the need for an explicit conditional check.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive and should pass the failing test case.
