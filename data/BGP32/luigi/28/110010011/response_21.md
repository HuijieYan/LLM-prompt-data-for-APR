### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue arises because the function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command, which might not match due to case differences.

### Identified Error Locations:
The bug is likely occurring in the comparison part of the function, where it checks if the table exists in the stdout without considering case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing the test cases to fail because the table name specified with different casing compared to what is returned by the Hive command. The function does not handle case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results in the comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to the same case (e.g., lower case) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them, making the table existence check case-insensitive. This fix should address the failing test cases reported in the GitHub issues.
