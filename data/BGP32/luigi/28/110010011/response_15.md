## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function, as the comparison is case-sensitive.

2. The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where the comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.

3. The bug occurs because the function is not handling case insensitivity when checking if the table exists. The `stdout` obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function may have different casing than the provided table name, leading to the function returning incorrect results.

4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

5. Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the function returns the correct result even if the casing of the table name in the database is different.
