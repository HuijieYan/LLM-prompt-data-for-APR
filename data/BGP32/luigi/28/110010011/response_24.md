### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is within the `HiveCommandClient` class, which extends `HiveClient`.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the issue arises when testing for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to prevent failures due to case mismatch.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that it checks for the exact match of the table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures when the table names are in different cases in the Hive database compared to the input table name.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to lowercase both the received table name and the table names retrieved from Hive before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and prevent test failures due to case mismatches.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table names, the corrected `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database. This change addresses the bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected.
