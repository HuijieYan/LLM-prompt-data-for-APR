### Analyze the buggy function:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug appears to be related to case sensitivity in comparing the table name. The test cases are failing due to the function not handling case sensitivity properly.

### Identify potential error locations:
The error seems to be occurring in the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from Hive. The function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.

### Explain the cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. Hive is case insensitive, so the table names are returned in lowercase, causing the direct comparison to fail.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

### Provide a corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to make it case insensitive.
- The function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty after running the Hive command, otherwise, it returns `False`.

This corrected version should address the issue of case sensitivity and enable the function to pass the failing test cases as described in the GitHub issue.
