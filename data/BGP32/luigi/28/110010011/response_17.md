### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine table existence.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates an AssertionError because the test is not handling case insensitivity properly. The issue on GitHub (#896) also mentions the same problem.
4. The bug occurs because the function is comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity.
5. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the function to convert both the `table` name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison.
2. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table_lower = table.lower()
        
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the output to lowercase for comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive. This should resolve the AssertionError and align with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue #896.
