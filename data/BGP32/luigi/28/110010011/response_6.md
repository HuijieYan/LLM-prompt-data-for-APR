### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the table existence check is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail.
3. The GitHub issue points out that tables in Hive are case-insensitive, leading to the discrepancy in table names between the query result and the input.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive when comparing the table names in the query result.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the query result to lowercase for comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the query result in the `table_exists` function. Since the table names in Hive are case-insensitive, this comparison leads to test failures when different cases are used.

### Proposed Fix:
To resolve the bug, we will modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the query result to lowercase before the comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This fix will resolve the failing tests and address the issue raised on GitHub.
