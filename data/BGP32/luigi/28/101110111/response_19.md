## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database with or without a specific partition. The bug arises when the function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
2. The failing test cases reveal that the buggy function is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking the existence of the table in the Hive output.
3. The failing assertion errors indicate that the function fails to return the correct value based on the case of the table name in the Hive response.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` response to lowercase before performing the comparison.
5. The correction will address the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the function returns the expected results.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` response to lowercase before comparison, we address the case insensitivity issue. This correction ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of the table regardless of the case of the table name.
