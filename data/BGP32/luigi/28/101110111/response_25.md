## Correction:

To address the bug in the `table_exists` function that causes the failing test cases, we need to update the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output received from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)

```

The correction involves converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable to lowercase before performing a comparison. This change ensures that the function is case-insensitive when checking for the existence of the table.

By making this modification, the corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases provided earlier.

This revised implementation also aligns with the proposed fix for GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to address the identified problem.

The corrected version of the function resolves the bug and satisfies the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
