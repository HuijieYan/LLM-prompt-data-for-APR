After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the following potential error locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the tables listed in stdout is case-sensitive, leading to failures in case-insensitive scenarios.
2. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it, causing discrepancies when checking table existence.

The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not considering case-insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. As Hive is case-insensitive, the function needs to compare lowercase versions of the table names. This discrepancy leads to failing tests where the table names differ in cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This adjustment will ensure a case-insensitive comparison and align with Hive's behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` and the `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- The function now returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists, and `False` otherwise.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and ensure correct behavior for case-insensitive comparison in Hive.
