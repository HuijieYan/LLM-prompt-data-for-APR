After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the cause of the bug. The issue lies in the table name comparison in the `table_exists` function. The function compares the table name retrieved from the output with the given table name without considering case sensitivity. However, Hive is case-insensitive, so the comparison should also be case-insensitive to avoid failures.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner, allowing the test cases to pass successfully. The corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output values and addresses the issue raised on GitHub.

Please ensure to update the codebase with this corrected version to resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
