To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive case insensitive. We will modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive. This change will fix the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.

This corrected version addresses the issue raised in GitHub and aligns with the suggested solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
