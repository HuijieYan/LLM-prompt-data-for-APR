Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case-sensitivity issue when comparing table names in the output of the Hive command. The function needs to be updated to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, the function will now be able to handle the case-insensitive nature of Hive table names properly.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected input/output values in the test cases provided and resolve the issue reported in GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
