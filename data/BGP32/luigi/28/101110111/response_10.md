To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity when comparing table names with the output from Hive commands. The current implementation of the function does not consider the case of the table names, leading to failures in case-sensitive comparisons.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of changes:
1. Modify the condition to check if the lowercase version of the table name is in the lowercase version of the output from Hive commands.
2. Removed unnecessary conditional statements for returning `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout`, as checking for the existence of `stdout` is enough.

By making these changes, the fixed function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons between table names and the output from Hive commands, addressing the issues identified in the failing tests.

The corrected function should pass all the failing test cases mentioned, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue about making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
