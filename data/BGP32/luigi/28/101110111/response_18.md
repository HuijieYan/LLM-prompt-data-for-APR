## Correction:

### Analysis:
The issue with the `table_exists` function is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name's capitalization differs from the output.

### Error Location:
The error is in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The comparison should be case-insensitive to prevent failures due to different capitalizations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a case-sensitive comparison in the table_exists function, which doesn't account for variations in letter case between provided table names and names returned by Hive.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This correction will address the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
