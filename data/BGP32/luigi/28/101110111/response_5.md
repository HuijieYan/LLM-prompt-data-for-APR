To address the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison. This will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation:
- We modified the comparison in the `if partition is None` block to compare the lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout`.
- This modification makes the comparison case-insensitive and ensures that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case.

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the given test cases and meet the expected input/output values. The correction also addresses the GitHub issue regarding making the table_exists function case-insensitive.
