To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue. We can modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence in the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking if the table exists in the database.
- For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout` after running the command.
- The function now compares the lowercase table names for case-insensitive existence checks.

This correction ensures that the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive when checking for table existence.

The corrected version should pass all the failing test cases mentioned previously and satisfy the expected input/output values.
