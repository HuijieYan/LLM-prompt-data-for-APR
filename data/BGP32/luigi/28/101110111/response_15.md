Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by a case sensitivity issue. The function compares the provided table name against the tables retrieved from Hive without considering case sensitivity, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive match between the names. This modification will address the assertion errors encountered in the failing test cases and align with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896.

The corrected function satisfies all the expected input/output values outlined for the test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to table existence and case sensitivity.
