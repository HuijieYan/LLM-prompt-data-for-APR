## Fixing the Bug

### Error:
The buggy function `table_exists()` fails to correctly check for table existence due to case sensitivity issues. It expects the table name to be case-sensitive while the `run_hive_cmd` function returns a lowercase table name. This inconsistency leads to failing test cases asserting incorrect results.

### Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `table_exists()` function is comparing the table name directly without accounting for case sensitivity. When the table name is provided in different cases (capitalized or lowercase), the function fails to recognize the table's existence correctly due to case mismatch.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` is case-insensitive. By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, we can avoid case mismatch issues and accurately determine if the table exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Description of the Fix:
- In the corrected version, the comparison `table in stdout` is replaced with `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())`. This change ensures that both the provided table name and the names listed in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.
- The usage of `str.lower` is employed to make sure case sensitivity is removed from both sides of the comparison, allowing for a successful check of table existence regardless of case differences.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists()` function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing test cases.
