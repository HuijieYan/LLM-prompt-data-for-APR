To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for existence. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation:
- In the corrected version, both the `table` name and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison.
- This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread and fixing the failing test cases.
- The corrected function should now pass all the test cases and meet the expected input/output values as outlined in the test cases.

By making this change, we ensure that the table name comparison is not affected by case sensitivity issues and aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
