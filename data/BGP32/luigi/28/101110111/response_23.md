Based on the provided information and the failing test cases, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function should be case-insensitive to match the behavior of Hive, which converts all table names to lowercase.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug exists in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. When checking if a table exists, the function compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failing test cases where the table names have different cases in the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Updated and Corrected `table_exists` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version of the function should pass all the failing test cases and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive as expected.

Make sure to update the unit test accordingly to reflect the corrected behavior of the `table_exists` function.

This approach aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue #896, where it was recommended to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
