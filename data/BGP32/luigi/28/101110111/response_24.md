To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the output of the Hive command to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name provided and the tables listed in the stdout from the Hive command.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases provided and address the issue mentioned on GitHub.
