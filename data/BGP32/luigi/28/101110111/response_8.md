## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a given database in Hive. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output for table existence.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from `run_hive_cmd`. If the table name has different cases than the output, the function incorrectly evaluates the existence of the table.
3. The failing test case is specifically testing the case sensitivity issue by checking for table names in different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is done in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def table_exists(self, table: str, database='default', partition: Union[dict, None] = None) -> bool:
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison (`table.lower() in stdout.lower()`), the function will be case-insensitive and correctly detect the existence of tables with different cases.

This correction addresses the bug reported in the failing test and aligns with the requested fix for the GitHub issue related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
