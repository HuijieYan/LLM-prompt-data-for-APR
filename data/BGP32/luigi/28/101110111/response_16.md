To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the contents of `stdout` case insensitive. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
from typing import Optional

def table_exists(self, table: str, database: str = 'default', partition: Optional[dict] = None) -> bool:
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison to avoid case sensitivity issues.
- The function now returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the test cases provided and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding case sensitivity.
