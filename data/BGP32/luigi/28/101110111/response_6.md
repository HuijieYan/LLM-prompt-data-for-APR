The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name against the output obtained from Hive. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we address the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the function behaves correctly in case-insensitive scenarios.

With this correction, the function should now pass all the test cases provided, including the ones that were failing previously due to case sensitivity issues. This change also addresses the GitHub issue #896 related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
