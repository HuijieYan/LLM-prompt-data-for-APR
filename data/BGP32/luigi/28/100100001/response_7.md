Based on the provided buggy function and failing test, the issue arises from the comparison logic within the `table_exists` function. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database, with or without a specified partition. The bug stems from the comparison of the table name within the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic to properly handle the table name and ensure that it is correctly identified within the output string. Additionally, we should make sure that the function can handle case-insensitive table name comparisons.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the issue of the table name comparison should be resolved, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
