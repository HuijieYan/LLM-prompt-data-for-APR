The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be caused by the incorrect condition checking for the presence of the table name in the output. The function currently checks if `stdout` exists and then if the table is in it, which might not work as intended.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly parses the output to check for the existence of the table name in it.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout != ""
```

By splitting the `stdout` string on the newline character and checking if the `table` is present in the list of tables returned, we can ensure that the function correctly detects the existence of the table.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
