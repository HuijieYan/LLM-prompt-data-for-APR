The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic for checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the exact match.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement in both branches to ensure that we check for an exact match rather than just a substring match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- In the first branch, we split the stdout returned from `run_hive_cmd` by whitespace and check if the exact table name is present in the list of tables, returning `True` if it is present.
- In the second branch, we directly return the boolean value of `stdout` since we are not doing any specific evaluation for the partition.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
