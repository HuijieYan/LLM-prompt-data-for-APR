### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file is checking for the presence of a table in a given database and partition. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `stdout` output with the table name.

The test case provided in the `hive_test.py` file is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and setting different return values to test the table existence function. The bug is identified when the return value contains the table name but the function fails to recognize it.

### Identified Issue:
The bug lies in the comparison condition where it checks for `table in stdout`. The function fails to handle multiple lines in the `stdout` output which results in incorrect comparison and causes the test case failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` into lines and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

After making this modification to the `table_exists` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case successfully.
