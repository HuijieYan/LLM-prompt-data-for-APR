The bug in the provided function `table_exists()` is due to the incorrect logic when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function is returning True if the table name is found in the output of the command, which is incorrect. It should return True only if the exact table name (without any extra characters) is found in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists()` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version:
- We now split the stdout by newline character to ensure that the table names are exact matches.
- We return `False` if the stdout is empty or the table name is not found.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases provided.
