### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect return values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not work correctly for all cases where the table exists.
2. The condition `if stdout:` may not properly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` when checking for table partition existence.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function not correctly handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This results in incorrect return values for table existence checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output from `run_hive_cmd` is parsed correctly to determine if the table or partition exists. We should also handle cases where the output may contain multiple lines or unexpected formats.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout != ""  # Check if any partitions exist

```
In the corrected version:
1. When checking for the existence of a table, the stdout is split into lines to properly check for the table name.
2. To determine if a partition exists, we check if stdout is not empty, indicating the presence of partitions.

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
