The bug in the provided function is that it is not handling the case sensitivity of table names properly. The function is comparing the table names directly without considering case, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison of table names case-insensitive. One way to do this is by converting both the table name and the output from hive command to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner and pass the provided test cases.
