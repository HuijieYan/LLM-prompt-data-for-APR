### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug in the way it checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The bug arises from the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, which does not account for the case where the table name is part of a larger string in the stdout. This causes the function to sometimes return incorrect results.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, where it checks if the table name is directly in the stdout without considering the context.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the table name is part of another string in the stdout. So it incorrectly concludes that the table exists when it's actually not present.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. Instead, we can split the stdout based on newline characters and then check if the table name exists as a separate line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
Now, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function splits the stdout by newline character and then checks if the table name exists as a separate line. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table.
