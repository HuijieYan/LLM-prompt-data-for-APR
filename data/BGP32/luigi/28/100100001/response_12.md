The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not correctly checking if the table exists in the Hive database. The bug is specifically in the comparison logic after running the Hive command and parsing the output.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to correctly check if the table exists in the stdout output returned by the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Simply return the boolean value of stdout
```

By modifying the logic to correctly check if the table exists in the stdout output, the corrected function should pass the failing test provided.
