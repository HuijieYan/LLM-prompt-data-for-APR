### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is returning `True` only if the stdout is not empty, which is incorrect. The function should return `True` if the table name is found in the stdout.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `return` statement where it checks for `stdout` to be present, instead of checking if the `table` name is present in the `stdout`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition in the `return` statements of the `table_exists` function. The function is returning `True` if the stdout is not empty, instead of checking if the `table` name is present in the stdout.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `return` statements of the `table_exists` function to check if the `table` name is present in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return table in stdout
        else:
            return False
```

By making this correction, the `table_exists` function should now correctly return `True` if the `table` name is found in the `stdout`, which will fix the bug and the function will pass the failing test.
