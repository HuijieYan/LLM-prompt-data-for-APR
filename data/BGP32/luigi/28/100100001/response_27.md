1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. It takes parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function could be the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being used to check for table existence, as well as the handling of the different cases when `partition` is specified.

3. The bug in the function is likely due to the way it checks for the existence of a table. The function uses the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists, but it may not be handling the output correctly. This can lead to incorrect results being returned based on the presence of the table in the output.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly parses the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to accurately determine if the table exists. Additionally, the handling of the cases when `partition` is specified should be reviewed and corrected accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')[1:]  # Skipping the first line "OK" in output

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0  # Checking if output has any content

```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and accurately check for the existence of a table in the specified database.
