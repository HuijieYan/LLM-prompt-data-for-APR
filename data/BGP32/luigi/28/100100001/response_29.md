The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with how it checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The problem lies in the logic of how the function handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The current implementation checks if the stdout is empty or not to determine if the table exists. This logic is flawed because in the case where the stdout is not empty but does not contain the table name, it incorrectly concludes that the table exists. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly parses the stdout and checks for the existence of the table name within it.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` based on newline characters and checking if the table name is present in the resulting list, we can accurately determine the existence of the table. This correction ensures that the function correctly identifies whether the table exists in Hive.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test provided for the `apacheclient` table existence check.
