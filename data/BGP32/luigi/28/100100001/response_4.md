After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the potential error location in the `table_exists` function where the condition for checking the existence of a table is incorrect. 

The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly checking for the presence of the table name in the output of the Hive command without handling case sensitivity due to the use of the `in` operator. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases where the table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check for the table name in the Hive command output. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the lines of the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split("\n"))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using the revised version of the `table_exists` function, the corrected function now performs a case-insensitive check for the table name in the Hive command output. This modification should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
