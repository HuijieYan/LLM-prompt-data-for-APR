### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file is causing test failures in the `hive_test.py` file. The issue lies in the condition check for the existence of a table in the specified database. The function is not handling the case where the table name is contained in the stdout output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition statements where the function checks for the presence of the table in the stdout output.
2. The partition checking logic in the else block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the stdout output when checking for the existence of a table. The function currently checks if the returned stdout contains the table name exactly, which is leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks so that they correctly identify the presence of the table name within the stdout output. This can be achieved by splitting the stdout into lines and checking if the table name is present in any of those lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the stdout into lines and check if the table name is present in any of those lines. Additionally, we simplify the logic in the else block to directly return the boolean evaluation of the stdout.
