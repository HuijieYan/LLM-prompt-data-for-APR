From the provided buggy function and failing test, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison logic of the `table_exists` function. The function is not handling the case when the table name is found in the output correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic of how the function checks for the existence of a table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the necessary adjustments to the comparison logic, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
