### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` fails to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue lies in the logic of checking the presence of a table in the Hive output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison of table name with stdout output.
2. Improper handling of partitioned tables.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly parse the output of the Hive command. In the if block, it checks if the table name is present in the output string without considering the format of the output. This results in incorrect handling of the table existence check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly parse the stdout output of the Hive command to determine table existence.
2. Ensure that the function handles both regular and partitioned tables correctly.
3. Modify the logic to accurately determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})')
        return bool(stdout)
```

By properly parsing the stdout of the Hive command and using the correct querying format, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine the existence of tables, both partitioned and unpartitioned.
