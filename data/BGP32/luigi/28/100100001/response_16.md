To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the issue of comparing the table name in the `stdout` output correctly. The buggy function is currently checking for an exact match of the table name in the output, but the test cases include scenarios where the table name appears in a multi-line string. We need to modify the function to correctly parse and compare the table names in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split()
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version:
- For tables without partition, we retrieve all the tables and iterate over them to check if the input table name matches. We use lowercase comparison to handle cases with different letter cases.
- For tables with partition, we keep the same logic as before.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle the comparison of the table names and pass the failing test cases.
