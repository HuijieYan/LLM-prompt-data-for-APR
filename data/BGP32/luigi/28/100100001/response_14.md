The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic of checking if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The function is not handling the case where the table name is part of a larger string in the output and is incorrectly returning `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly check if the table name appears as a separate entry in the output. We can split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name is in the list of strings.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters, we can ensure that we are correctly checking if the table name appears as a separate entry. This correction should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
