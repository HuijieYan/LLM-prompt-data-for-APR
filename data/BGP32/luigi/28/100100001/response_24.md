### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue in the `else` block where it checks for the existence of a table with a specific partition. The condition `if stdout` will return `True` for any non-empty string, even if it doesn't contain the table name. This leads to incorrect results when checking for table existence with partitions.

### Error:
The bug in the `else` block lies in the condition `if stdout`, which does not accurately check if the table exists with the specified partition.

### Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition `if stdout` only checks if the `stdout` variable has any content, and it doesn't specifically verify if the table name exists in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `else` block to correctly check if the table name with the specified partition exists in the stdout output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            for part in partitions:
                if partition in part:
                    return True
        return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newline characters and checking if the specified partition is present in each line, we can accurately determine if the table exists with the specified partition. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
