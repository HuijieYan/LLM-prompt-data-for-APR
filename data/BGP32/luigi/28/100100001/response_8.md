After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it is clear that the issue lies in how the `table_exists` function is checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The bug appears to be related to the way it handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. The function is not correctly parsing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine whether the table exists or not.

To fix this bug, we should modify how the function handles the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`, ensuring that it correctly identifies if the table exists in the given database and partition.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s;
                                show partitions %s partition (%s);""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly check for the existence of tables in Hive and pass the failing test provided.
