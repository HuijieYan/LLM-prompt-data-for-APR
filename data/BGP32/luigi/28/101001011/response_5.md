### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it checks for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner. The bug arises because the `table` variable is not being converted to lowercase for comparison, leading to failures when the table name case does not match exactly due to the case-insensitivity of Hive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive. In Case 2 and Case 4, the table names returned in stdout are lowercase, causing a mismatch with the original table name (`MyTable`). The bug is triggered by the lack of case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison should be case-insensitive. The `table` variable should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table` variable is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive, making the comparison case-insensitive. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
