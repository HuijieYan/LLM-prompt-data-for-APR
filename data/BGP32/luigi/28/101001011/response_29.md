### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does a case-sensitive check for table names, which could lead to failures when the case of the table name in the database does not match the case provided in the function call.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This can cause discrepancies, especially when the case of the table name in the database differs from the case provided in the function call.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase in the comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check and addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
