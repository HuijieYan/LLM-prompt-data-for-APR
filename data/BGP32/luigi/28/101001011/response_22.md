### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table names from the Hive output. This leads to failing tests when the case of the table name does not match the case in the Hive output.

### Bug Explanation:
In the `table_exists` function, the comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive. If the table name is capitalized in the input but returned in lowercase from Hive, the comparison fails.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, the corrected function will handle case sensitivity properly and resolve the failing tests as reported in the GitHub issues.
