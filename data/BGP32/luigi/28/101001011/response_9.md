### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database in a case-sensitive manner. The bug arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the output from the hive command does not handle case sensitivity properly. The provided runtime values and types indicate that the bug occurs due to this case insensitivity issue.

### Error Location:
The error is located in the comparison line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
This comparison is not handling case sensitivity properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the mismatch in case between the table name provided and the table names retrieved from the hive command's output. Hive is case-insensitive, so the returned table names are in lowercase while the comparison is done in the original case, leading to incorrect evaluation and causing the test failures highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the hive command output to lowercase (or uppercase) before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before the comparison. This modification will ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue and fixing the problem.
