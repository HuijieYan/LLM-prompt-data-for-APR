### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` encounters issues when comparing table names due to case sensitivity. The function compares the table name with the output obtained from a Hive command without considering case differences, leading to test failures as reported in GitHub issues.

### Bugs:
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing table names causing test failures.
2. The comparison between the table name and output `stdout` is case-sensitive.
3. The function does not conform to the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, which suggests making the comparison case insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Implement case-insensitive comparison to address the reported issue on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

The corrected version ensures that both the table name and output `stdout` are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the reported bug on GitHub.
