## Identified Bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name with the stdout retrieved from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison should also be case-insensitive to accurately determine if the table exists.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison statement to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase during comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.
