### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises from case sensitivity because Hive is case insensitive. The function compares the table name directly with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case. This leads to test failures when the case of the table names differs.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that it directly compares the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`, leading to case sensitivity issues.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by adopting a consistent case for comparison. In this case, converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison would resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing them. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
