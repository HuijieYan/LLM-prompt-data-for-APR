### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function directly checks if the table name is present in the output received from Hive, which can be problematic due to case differences between the provided table name and how Hive returns table names (usually in lowercase).

In the provided test cases, we can observe that when comparing the actual table name with the table names present in the output, case differences cause the function to incorrectly determine the table's existence.

The GitHub issues referenced highlight this problem and suggest a solution of converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To address the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In this corrected version, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` variable are converted to lowercase for the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in Hive.
