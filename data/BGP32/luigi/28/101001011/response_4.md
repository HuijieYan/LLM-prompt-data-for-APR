### Analyzing the buggy function

The function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database using a Hive command. However, there is a bug identified in the function related to case sensitivity. The GitHub issue highlighted that Hive is case-insensitive, causing discrepancies when comparing the table name.

1. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
2. The function uses the `partition_spec` method from the same class to construct the partition specification for the Hive command.
3. The function checks if a table exists in the specified database by running a Hive command and analyzing the output.

### Potential error locations
The bug lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which does not handle case sensitivity correctly.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises from the inconsistency in case sensitivity between the table name provided and the table names returned by Hive commands. As Hive is case-insensitive, comparing the exact table name might lead to false negatives.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lower case before performing the comparison.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive commands are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This modification aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, fixing the bug related to case sensitivity in table existence checks in Hive.
