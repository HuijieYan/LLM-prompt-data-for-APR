## Identification of Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it performs a case-sensitive check when verifying if a table exists in the Hive database. However, the Hive database is case-insensitive regarding table names. This results in tests failing when the table names have different cases.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The `table_exists` function constructs a Hive query to check for the existence of a table in the database. It then compares the expected table name with the output obtained from the Hive query. This comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the case of the table name does not match exactly with the output from the Hive query due to Hive being case-insensitive.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the expected table name and the output from the Hive query needs to be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the check.

## Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

## Changes Made:
1. Converted the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. Simplified the return statements to improve readability and correctness.

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now work correctly regardless of the case of the table names in the Hive database.
