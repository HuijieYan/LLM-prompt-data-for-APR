### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name retrieved from Hive against the provided table name. The function doesn't account for case differences, leading to incorrect results. This issue was highlighted in a GitHub issue where tables defined with different cases were causing failures due to case sensitivity discrepancies between Hive and the table names provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the names retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the provided table name (`table`) and the names retrieved from Hive (`stdout`) to lowercase during comparison, the function now handles case insensitivity correctly, addressing the issue reported on GitHub. This fix ensures that tables with different case variants are correctly identified by the `table_exists` function.
