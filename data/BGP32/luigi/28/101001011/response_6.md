### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from the command output with the provided table name. In the given cases, the table names in the output might be in a different case than the provided table name, leading to incorrect evaluations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison between the provided table name and the table names extracted from the command output case-insensitive. By converting both names to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the check is correct regardless of the case of the names.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Modification for case-insensitive check
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version above, the `table_exists` function now converts both the provided table name and the names extracted from the command output to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive match. This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provides a more robust check for table existence.
