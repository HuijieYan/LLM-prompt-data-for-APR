### Error Location:
The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where it checks the presence of a table in Hive using a case-sensitive comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison between the table name provided and the table names returned by Hive. Hive is case-insensitive, so comparing the tables in a case-sensitive manner leads to false negatives. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub issue where it was suggested to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and the tables returned in `stdout` are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
