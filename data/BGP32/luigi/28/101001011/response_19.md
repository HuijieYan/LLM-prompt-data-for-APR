### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of the table name with the stdout is case-sensitive.
2. The stdout may contain different case representations of the table name.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is case-sensitive. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may appear in stdout with different cases, causing the comparison to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The fixed version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Both the `table` and the content of `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.
2. The unnecessary `if-else` statement is simplified to just return a boolean value based on whether `stdout` has a value or not.
