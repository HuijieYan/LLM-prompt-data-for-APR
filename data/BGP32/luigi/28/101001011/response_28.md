### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the expected table name with the table names retrieved from the Hive command output. The function checks if the provided table name matches any table names returned by the Hive command, but the comparison is case-sensitive. This causes failures when comparing table names that are in different cases.

### Bug Location:
The root cause of the error lies in the comparison logic within the `table_exists` function. Specifically, the condition `table in stdout` or `table.lower() in stdout` is not accounting for case-insensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not consider case sensitivity when comparing the expected table name with the table names retrieved from the Hive command output. This leads to incorrect results when the names are in different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the expected table name and the names from the output to a consistent case (lowercase or uppercase) before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Correction Details:
- Modified the condition in the `if` block to check if the lowercase version of the expected table name is in the lowercase version of the stdout.
- Improved readability and maintainability by using `bool(stdout)` directly to determine if the table exists based on the stdout content.
- By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive table existence checks.
