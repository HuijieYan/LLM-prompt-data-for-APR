The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name obtained from the Hive command with the input table name. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison should also be case-insensitive to prevent failures.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly without considering case differences. As per the provided test cases, when the table name is retrieved from the Hive command output, it might be in a different case than the input table name, leading to false negatives.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command to be case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, both the input table name and the output table name from the Hive command are converted to lowercase for comparison, making it case-insensitive. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and resolves the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
