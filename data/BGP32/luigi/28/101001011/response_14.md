### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is performing a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from `stdout`. This leads to failing tests when the table names are in different cases, even though Hive is case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to return False even when the table exists, resulting in test failures. The incorrect comparison in the code makes it fail to find the table in `stdout` when the case of the table name doesn't match exactly with what is returned by Hive.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the table names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function accurately detects the table's existence irrespective of its case.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version ensures a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from Hive in `stdout`. Now, the function should accurately determine the existence of tables regardless of their case.
