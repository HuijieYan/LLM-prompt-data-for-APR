### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` might fail if the case of `table` and the table name in the database does not match due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The partition specification may not be formatted correctly, leading to incorrect queries.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name retrieved from the Hive query `show tables` with the table name provided as the input parameter. If the names do not match due to case differences, the comparison will fail even if the table exists in the database.

### Correction Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison process to be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. This change will ensure that table names are correctly matched regardless of their case.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_query))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name comparison is now case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.
- The partition specification in the query is correctly formatted based on the actual requirements.

This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence.
