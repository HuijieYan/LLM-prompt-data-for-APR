### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue is documented in GitHub and suggests making the function case insensitive to address the problem.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. Due to Hive being case insensitive, mismatches can occur when comparing table names in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison to consider case insensitivity. Using lowercase for comparison will ensure that the check is consistent regardless of the case of the table name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparisons between the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function. This modification ensures that the function `table_exists` is now case insensitive, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
