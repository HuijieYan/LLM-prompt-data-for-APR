### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` might lead to case sensitivity issues.
2. The string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call could be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the comparison `table in stdout`, which is case sensitive. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this causes the function to incorrectly determine if the table exists or not. The GitHub issue further confirms this problem and suggests checking `stdout` against the lowercase variant of `table` to resolve the case sensitivity issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison line to make it case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By performing a case-insensitive comparison using the lowercase variants of `table` and `stdout`, we resolve the bug and align with the suggestions from the GitHub issue.
