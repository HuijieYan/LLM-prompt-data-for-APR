## Identified Bug:
The `table_exists` function is case sensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. This causes issues when the table names have different cases, as described in the GitHub issue. The function should perform a case-insensitive check on the table names.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. By following the suggestion in the GitHub issue, we can modify the comparison to use the lowercased versions of the table name and the output from Hive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now accurately determine the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner.
