### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not returning the correct value when checking if a table exists. The issue lies in the conditional statements in the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic in the `if` condition that checks if `stdout` is not empty and the table is in `stdout`.
2. The logic in the `else` condition that checks if `stdout` is not empty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the possibility of the table name being within the `stdout` output. The conditions are mistakenly negated, leading to incorrect evaluation of the existence of the table.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditions in the `if` and `else` blocks of the `table_exists` function need to be adjusted to correctly check if the table exists based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout.strip():  # Check if stdout is not empty
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for checking the existence of a table have been fixed in the `if` and `else` blocks. The `strip()` method is used to remove leading and trailing whitespaces, ensuring accurate evaluation of the `stdout` output. This correction should make the function return the correct result when checking if a table exists.
