The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing the failing test cases to fail due to incorrect evaluation of the return values. The issue lies in the condition check for returning True or False based on the presence of the table in the stdout output.

The buggy function is not handling the case where the stdout contains the table name but with additional content before or after the table name. As a result, the condition `table in stdout` is failing to match the complete table name.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to check if the table name appears in a line by itself within the stdout. We can split the stdout by newline characters and check each line for an exact match with the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
            
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will split the stdout by newline characters and check each line separately for an exact match with the table name, ensuring the correct evaluation of the table existence.

After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
