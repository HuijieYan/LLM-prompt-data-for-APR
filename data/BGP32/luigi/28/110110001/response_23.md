## Analyzing the buggy function and test code
- The buggy function is the `table_exists` method within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
- The test code is within the `test/contrib/hive_test.py` file and tries to test the `table_exists` method with various scenarios.
- The failing test checks for the case insensitivity of table names where the method should return `True`.
- The bug seems to be related to the case sensitivity when checking for table existence.

## Identifying potential error locations
1. The comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the given table in a case-sensitive manner might be causing the bug.
2. The handling of partitioned tables may not be correct, leading to incorrect return values for the method.

## Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `table_exists` method is that it directly compares the table names in a case-sensitive manner, which causes the test for case-insensitive table names to fail. Additionally, the handling of partition information is not fully implemented, resulting in incorrect return values for the method.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the method to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.
2. Correct the implementation for handling partitioned tables to ensure the method returns the correct value.

## Corrected version of the `table_exists` method
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The method now converts both the table name and the list of tables retrieved from Hive (split by newline) to lowercase before comparison.
- For partitioned tables, the method now simply checks if `stdout` is non-empty to indicate table existence.
- The corrected version should address the case sensitivity issue and provide a more accurate handling of partitioned tables.

By using this modified `table_exists` method, the failing test cases should pass successfully.
