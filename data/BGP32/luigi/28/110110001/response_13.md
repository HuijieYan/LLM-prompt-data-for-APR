## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case-insensitive table name comparison properly, leading to failing test cases.
2. In the failing test cases, the function is returning bool values based on the presence of the table in the stdout, but it is not considering case-insensitive comparisons.
3. The failing test cases provide multiple scenarios where the function is expected to return `True` but is failing due to case-insensitive table name comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the provided table name and the table names in the output is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the names in the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected `table_exists` function will now handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly and pass the failing test cases.
