### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test case due to incorrect comparison logic. The function is intended to check if a table exists in a database, and it uses a `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The error seems to be located in the `if stdout:` block where it always returns `True`, regardless of the value of `stdout`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks the truthiness of `stdout` instead of explicitly checking if the table name is present in the output. The failing test cases provide text outputs to the function and check for the expected behavior of the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `if stdout:` block to determine if the table exists in the database based on the output returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

Now, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function explicitly checks if the table name is in the output returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
