### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a database using `hive` invocations.
- The function has an issue where it is not correctly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function to return specific values and then checking if the `table_exists` function behaves correctly based on those values.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning incorrect results in the case of table existence check, leading to an assertion error.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely in how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, specifically in the condition check that verifies if the table exists.

### Cause of Bug:
- The buggy function does not handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` correctly when checking for the existence of a table. It is comparing the table name with the entire output instead of looking for the table name in the output.
- This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly check if the table name exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now returns `bool(stdout)` directly for both cases (table existence and partition check).
- The comparison for table existence is fixed to check if the table name is in the output, ensuring the function returns the correct results.
- This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
