## Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the class `HiveCommandClient` is `table_exists`.
2. The buggy function checks if a table exists in the Hive database based on the input parameters.
3. The failing test for this function asserts that the function should return True for a table that exists, but it erroneously returns False. This issue arises due to incorrect comparisons in the code.
4. The root cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database, leading to incorrect return values.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and compare the results to determine if the table exists.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            partition_filter = "WHERE"
            for key, value in partition.items():
                partition_filter += f" {key}='{value}' AND"
            partition_filter = partition_filter[:-4]  # Remove last "AND"
            
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} {partition_filter}")
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(partition["="] in partitions for partition in partition.items())
```

In the corrected version above:
- We split the output of `run_hive_cmd` to get a list of tables/partitions.
- We compare the desired table/partition existence using `in` and correct comparisons for partition filtering.
- The function now returns `True` if the table/partition exists, and `False` if it does not.

By making these corrections, the `table_exists` function should now accurately determine if a table or partition exists, fixing the bug reported in the failing test.
