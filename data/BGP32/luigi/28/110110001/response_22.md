The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is incorrectly checking the returned value from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug lies in the logic where it checks for the existence of a table in the stdout output.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is expecting the table name to appear in a specific format in the stdout output, which might not always be the case depending on how the `run_hive_cmd` is implemented. This leads to incorrect results being returned.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to check if the table name appears in any form in the stdout output, rather than matching it in a specific format. This will make the function more robust and ensure that it detects the existence of a table correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1};'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout.lower()
```

In this corrected version:
- The function now uses `run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))` to get the list of tables in the database, allowing it to check if the table exists in a more flexible way.
- It checks if the lowercase version of the table name appears in the lowercase version of any line in the stdout output when checking for table existence.
- For partitioned tables, it uses `run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1};'.format(database, table))` and checks if the partition specified exists in the stdout output. 

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
