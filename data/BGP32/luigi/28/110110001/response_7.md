## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the partition case correctly. The issue arises from how the cmd is being constructed and executed in the `else` block when a partition is provided.

## Bug:
The bug is caused by how the command is constructed in the `else` block using string formatting with `%s` placeholders. This leads to incorrect cmd execution and empty output, resulting in a `False` return statement.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly construct the command for checking table existence with partitions. We should use `str.format` instead of `%s` placeholders.

## Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using `str.format` to construct the partition command, we avoid issues related to formatting placeholders and ensure that the correct command is executed.
