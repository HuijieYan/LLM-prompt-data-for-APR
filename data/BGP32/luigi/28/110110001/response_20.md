## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is supposed to check if a table exists in the database using `hive` invocations. 
2. The bug occurs when checking if a table exists with a given name, causing the test to fail.
3. The bug is identified by the failing test case where the `table_exists` function returns `False` instead of `True` when the table actually exists. This is due to the condition of returning `True` if stdout is not empty, which is incorrect as it should return `True` if the table is found in stdout.
4. To fix the bug, the logical condition for returning the result from the function needs to be adjusted to ensure that it correctly checks whether the table exists in the output.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

## Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout  # Check if table name is in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return table in stdout  # Check if table name is in stdout
``` 

By adjusting the return condition to check if the table name is found in the stdout output, the function now correctly determines if the table exists and should pass the failing test cases.
