## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by invoking hive commands. 
- The function contains a bug in the logic when checking for the existence of a table with a given name.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` aims to validate the correctness of the `table_exists` function.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning incorrect results.
- The bug is likely due to how the function processes the stdout from the hive command output.

## Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the logic that checks the existence of a table. It incorrectly processes the stdout from the hive command, leading to incorrect evaluation.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic of how we process stdout from the hive command and accurately determine the table existence based on the output.

## Updated Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s(%s)" % (database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By fixing the logic to accurately process the stdout from the hive command output, the corrected `table_exists` function will now correctly determine the existence of a table.
