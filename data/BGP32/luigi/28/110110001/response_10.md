## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test because it is incorrectly handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expecting specific values in the stdout output, but it is not validating the output correctly.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic for checking table existence in the `stdout`.
2. Incorrect usage of string formatting in the Hive commands.
3. Potential issue with the `run_hive_cmd` function not returning expected values.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `table_exists` function tries to compare the `stdout` against the expected table name. However, the function does not correctly handle cases where the table name is in a multi-line string or when the stdout contains additional information.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the table existence check to handle multi-line output and properly validate the presence of the table name.
2. Fix the string formatting in the Hive commands to ensure correct query execution.
3. Ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the expected output for testing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` is executed with the correct Hive query syntax.
2. Table existence is checked by splitting the stdout output and searching for the table name.
3. The function returns a boolean based on whether the stdout is empty or not.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
