### Potential Error Location:
1. The conditional statement within the `table_exists` function is not properly structured to check the existence of a table in the output.
2. The string comparison method within the function might not be accurately checking for the presence of the table in the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect comparison logic between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional statement to properly check for the existence of the table in the output.
2. Modify the string comparison method to accurately identify the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return bool result of stdout presence
```

In the corrected version, the function now returns a boolean result based on the existence of the table name in the stdout output. This modification ensures that the correct comparison is made, fixing the bug.
