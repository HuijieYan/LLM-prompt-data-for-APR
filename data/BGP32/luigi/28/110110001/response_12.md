### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class from `luigi.contrib.hive` is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in a database.
2. The function has conditional logic based on whether a `partition` is specified or not.
3. The failing test is expecting that a table that exists will return `True` when checked using the `table_exists` function. However, due to the incorrect implementation in the `table_exists` function, the test fails with `AssertionError` for the case when the table actually exists.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic used to check the existence of a table within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect conditional logic in the `table_exists` function that fails to properly check for the existence of a table in the database. The function incorrectly handles the condition when a table exists in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly check for the existence of a table, regardless of whether a partition is specified or not. We should also ensure that it correctly handles the case where the table exists in the `stdout` output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False 
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show tables like "{1}";""".format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False 
```

In the corrected version above:
- We standardize the way the `stdout` is retrieved from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- We check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` and return `True` if it does, `False` otherwise for both cases where `partition` is None and when it is specified.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases provided.
