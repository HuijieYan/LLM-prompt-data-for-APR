The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking if a table exists in a specified database and partition. The bug is causing the test cases in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class to fail with assertion errors. 

The bug is located in the `table_exists` function where the logic for checking if a table exists is not correctly implemented. The function is checking for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it is not handling the case when the table name might be present within other lines in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly handle the cases when the table name is part of a larger string in the output. The function should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version will split the `stdout` by lines and check if the table name exists in any of the lines. It also simplifies the return statement at the end for the partition scenario.

After applying this corrected version, the `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
