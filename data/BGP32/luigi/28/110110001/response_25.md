## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, test code, corresponding error message:

- The buggy function `table_exists` is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `HiveClient` class.
- The test code `test_table_exists` is testing the `table_exists` method with different scenarios.
- The error message is `AssertionError: False is not true`, which indicates that the function is not returning the expected result.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

- The condition checking for the existence of a table in the `stdout` variable seems to be incorrect.
- The formatting of the command in the case where `partition is not None` might be incorrect.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:

- The first condition checks if the table is present in the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function, but the comparison is not handling the case when `stdout` is not empty.
- The second condition may not be constructing the command correctly, leading to incorrect results.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:

- Ensure that the condition to check for the table existence is handling empty `stdout` correctly.
- Review the construction of the command when a partition is provided to ensure it is accurate.

## A corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return (stdout and table in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return (stdout and partition in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version:
- The `stdout` variable is split by newlines to correctly compare table names.
- The command construction for checking partitions is updated with correct formatting and comparison.

This revised version should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
