### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database with or without a partition.
2. The bug lies in the conditional logic of the function where it checks for the truthiness of the `stdout` variable to determine if a table exists.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not returning the correct results when determining table existence. The error message clearly shows that the function is returning `False` when it should return `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function and accurately checks for table existence.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. For the non-partitioned case, split the output of `stdout` using `\n` and check if the table name exists in the resulting list.
2. For the partitioned case, split the output of `stdout` using `\n` and use the `partition_spec` function to construct the partition key. Then check if the partition key exists in the list of partitions.
3. Adjust the return statements accordingly to ensure the function correctly returns `True` if the table exists, and `False` if it doesn't.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            partition_key = self.partition_spec(partition)
            return partition_key in partitions
```

By implementing the corrected version above, the function should now correctly determine table existence in both non-partitioned and partitioned scenarios. This should ensure that the failing test cases pass successfully.
