The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case-insensitive table names correctly, which is causing the test case to fail. The function checks if the table exists by comparing the table name in the stdout result from running the "show tables" command. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, leading to the incorrect result in the test case for table names with different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the `stdout`. This can be achieved by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle tables with different cases and pass the failing test.
