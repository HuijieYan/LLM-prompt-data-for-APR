The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable when checking if a table exists. The issue arises from checking if the table name is in the output in a specific way that doesn't always work correctly.

The bug causes the test cases to fail because the function incorrectly determines whether a table exists or not based on the output of the Hive command, leading to AssertionErrors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we check if the table exists in the output of the Hive command. We should split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the resulting list of table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show tables like '{1}';""".format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

By modifying the function in this way, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies whether a table exists based on the output of the Hive command.

After making this change, the test cases should pass without any AssertionErrors.
