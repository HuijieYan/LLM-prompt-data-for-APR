### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects the table name to be an exact match with the output from the command, leading to failures when there are case differences.

The failing test clearly demonstrates the issue by providing a table name with a different case than the one in the output. The function fails to handle this case correctly, resulting in an assertion error.

The GitHub issue brings up the problem of case sensitivity and proposes a solution to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the logic to check if the lowercase table name exists in the lowercase output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making these modifications, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub.
