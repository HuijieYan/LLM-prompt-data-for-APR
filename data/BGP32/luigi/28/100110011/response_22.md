### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is intended to check if a given table exists in a Hive database, with optional partition information.
2. The buggy function fails during a test that is checking the case sensitivity of table names.
3. The function fails to account for case-insensitive comparison, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.
4. The suggested fix is to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from the Hive command to make the comparison case-insensitive.
5. Updating the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison will resolve the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is not handling case sensitivity correctly. It only performs a direct comparison between the provided table name and the output from the Hive command without considering case differences. As a result, when the table name in the command output does not match the case of the provided name, the test cases fail with assertion errors.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from the Hive command for case-insensitive matching. This will ensure that even if the case of the table name varies, the comparison will still succeed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to perform case-insensitive comparisons using lowercase versions of the table names, the bug should be fixed, and the provided test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
