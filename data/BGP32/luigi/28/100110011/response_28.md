### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file has a bug where it's not handling case insensitivity correctly while checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The failing test case in the `hive_test.py` file tests the method `table_exists` by checking different scenarios and expects the correct boolean value.
3. The error message indicates that the test cases are failing because the function is not returning the expected boolean values.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with case sensitivity in table existence checks and suggests a solution by comparing lowercase table names.
5. The bug can be fixed by ensuring the table names are converted to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file fails because it directly checks the table name without considering case insensitivity. Therefore, when the function returns the table names in lowercase, the comparison fails with the original table names provided in the test cases.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the provided table name to lowercase before comparing it with the table names in the output. This ensures case insensitivity in checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert table names to lowercase before comparison, the bug related to case insensitivity should be resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
