### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database based on the output received from the Hive command. The function has a conditional to handle tables with or without partitions.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` is checking if the table exists for different scenarios, including case sensitivity issues.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` where the test expects `True` but receives `False`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the case insensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case sensitivity properly. In the failing test, when checking for the existence of a table that differs only in case (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable'), the function does not convert the names to a consistent case for comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, it is necessary to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout strings to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the `test_table_exists` pass successfully.
