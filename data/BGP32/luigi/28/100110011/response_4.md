The buggy function `table_exists` in the luigi/contrib/hive.py file fails because it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly. The function checks if a table exists in the Hive database, but when matching the table name from the Hive output, it doesn't consider case differences, leading to test failures.

The cause of the bug is that when comparing the table name from the Hive output with the provided table name, the function doesn't account for case differences. This is evident from the failing test case where it expects the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the names in the Hive output to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we compare the table name and names in the Hive output after converting both to lowercase. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue as reported on GitHub.
