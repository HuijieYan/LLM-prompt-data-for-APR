### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with case sensitivity. It doesn't handle the case where the table names are provided in mixed cases leading to test failures.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` covers scenarios where the function should be case insensitive but fails due to a mismatch in case.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails when checking for the lowercase version of the table name.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The GitHub issue #896 provides insight into the problem and suggests a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.
2. Implement the suggestion from the GitHub issue #896 to address the case sensitivity issue.
3. Update the function to return `True` if the lowercase table name is found in the lowercase stdout.
4. Ensure that the corrected function handles table names in mixed cases correctly.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower()

```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive and able to handle mixed-case table names appropriately, resolving the issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
