### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database. The bug occurs when comparing the table name with the output in a case-sensitive manner.
2. The test function in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` reveals that the bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table with different cases (e.g., "mytable" and "MyTable").
3. The failing test case shows an Assertion Error where `self.assertTrue(returned)` fails, indicating that the comparison is not handling case insensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase for comparison in both scenarios to ensure a case-insensitive check.
5. The corrected version of the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison with `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected version will be case insensitive and pass the failing test cases. This fix aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug related to case sensitivity in table existence checks in Hive.
