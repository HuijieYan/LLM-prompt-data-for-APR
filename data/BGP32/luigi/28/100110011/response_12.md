Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for existing tables. The test case fails when trying to check if a table exists with different casing. The error message indicates that the assertion for `assertTrue` fails due to case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names. It directly compares the table name with the `stdout` without considering the case of the names. This causes the test case to fail when checking for tables with different casings.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables in `stdout` is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the tables in `stdout` to a consistent case (lowercase or uppercase) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After analyzing the bug and the suggested fix, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and (table.lower() in stdout.lower())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name (`table`) and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue of case sensitivity mentioned in the GitHub issue.
