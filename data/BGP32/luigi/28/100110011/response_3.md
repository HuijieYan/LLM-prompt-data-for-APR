## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where the case sensitivity of table names is causing the tests to fail.
2. The failing test in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is trying to check table existence for tables with different cases but the buggy function does not handle case insensitivity.
3. The error message from the failing test clearly indicates an `AssertionError` because the expected result is not being achieved due to case sensitivity.
4. The GitHub issue #896 raised by a user points out the problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking against lowercase versions of the table names in the `stdout`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not handling the case insensitivity of table names. When comparing the table name passed as an argument with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`, the function does not account for differences in case. This results in false negatives during the test cases.

## Solution:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name and the lowercase version of the `run_hive_cmd` output. This change will ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of both the table name and the `stdout`, we ensure that the function is case insensitive. This correction should enable the function to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
