### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `hive.py` file in the Luigi library.
2. The issue is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.
3. The failing test case `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` checks the case sensitivity of table names.
4. The error message indicates that the test case is expecting `True` but receiving `False`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid failures due to case differences.

### Bug Explanation:
The current implementation of the `table_exists` function compares `table` with the tables returned by the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when comparing table names with different letter cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to make the table existence check case insensitive by converting the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
- We use the `bool()` function to determine if any output was received.
- The corrected version should now pass all test cases, including those testing case sensitivity.

By making the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we ensure that table existence checks do not fail due to variations in letter casing.
