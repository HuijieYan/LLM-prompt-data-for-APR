### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given Hive database. The provided failing test `test_table_exists` in the `hive_test.py` file uses mock objects to simulate the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for table existence. The failing test aims to verify the correct behavior of the `table_exists` function by testing different scenarios.

The failing test fails when checking for the existence of a table with a different case, which leads to an assertion error. The test expects the function to be case insensitive when checking for the table name.

The corresponding GitHub issue #896 highlights the need for the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive due to potential discrepancies between table names defined in code and how they are represented in Hive.

### Error location and cause
The error in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the table name provided and the table names returned by Hive. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, the function needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison to ensure correct table existence checks.

### Bug fix strategy
To address the bug and pass the failing test, implement a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive. This can be achieved by converting both table names to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table names from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected `table_exists` function is now case insensitive, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
