### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not handling case insensitivity correctly when checking for existing tables in Hive.
2. The failing test in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is asserting for a table called "MyTable" but the function is not accounting for case insensitivity.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed because the function did not return `True` when it should have.
4. The GitHub issues highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle Hive's behavior properly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function is not converting the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the output from Hive. Therefore, when comparing the table names, the case sensitivity leads to failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This way, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
