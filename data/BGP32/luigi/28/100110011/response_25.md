The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug that causes the test cases to fail due to case sensitivity issues with table names. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case differences appropriately when checking if a table exists.

### Analysis:
1. The function checks for table existence in Hive by running a command and parsing the output.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function fails when table names are in different case formats.
3. The provided GitHub issue (#896) highlights the case sensitivity problem and suggests modifying the function to make it case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the tables listed in the output, without taking into account the case differences.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the function case-insensitive:
- Convert both the table name and the tables listed in the output to lowercase for comparison.
- Modify the function to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues and is more aligned with the expected behavior in Hive. This will resolve the failing test cases and address the case-insensitivity concern raised in the GitHub issue.
