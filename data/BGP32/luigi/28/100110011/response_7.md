### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `hive.py` is not handling the case-insensitivity of table names correctly, leading to test failures.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name with the output from Hive command without considering case differences.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` highlights the failure to recognize table names correctly due to case differences, leading to assertions errors.
4. The GitHub issues suggest that the function needs to be case-insensitive when checking table existence.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary:
The bug was fixed by ensuring that both the table name and the output from Hive command are converted to lowercase for comparison, making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. This fix will allow the function to correctly identify table existence despite case differences, resolving the test failures and addressing the GitHub issues related to case sensitivity.
