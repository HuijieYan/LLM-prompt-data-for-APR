### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name from `run_hive_cmd` output with the provided table name.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` expects that the function will handle case insensitivity and fails when it does not.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error because the expected result is not achieved due to case sensitivity in the comparison.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to prevent issues with table names being returned in lowercase.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function's case-sensitive comparison of the table name from the output of `run_hive_cmd` with the given table name. When the table names do not match in terms of case, the function returns incorrect results, leading to test failures and assertion errors.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the provided table name and the table name from the `run_hive_cmd` output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and will address the test failures and assertion errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table name from the output to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function will now handle case insensitivity properly, passing the failing test cases and resolving the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
