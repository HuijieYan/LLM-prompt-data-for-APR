### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it does not handle case-insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. This leads to failing tests.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` checks if the function can correctly identify the existence of a table irrespective of case.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` due to the function not handling the case-insensitivity issue.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive to avoid such problems in the future.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from comparing the table name without considering case differences. This leads to failed tests when there is a mismatch in case between the table name and the output from Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name ("table.lower()") and the output from Hive ("stdout.lower()") to lowercase before comparing them, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons and should pass the failing test cases.
