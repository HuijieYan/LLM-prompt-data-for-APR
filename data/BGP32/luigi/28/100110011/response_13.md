### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of `table` and `stdout` without considering case insensitivity.
2. The handling of partition specification if it is not None.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not account for case insensitivity when comparing the `table` name in the stdout returned from the Hive command. This results in test failures when trying to check if a table exists in Hive. The failing tests expect case insensitivity but are not currently handled in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout needs to be case insensitive. One approach is to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version of the function will be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
