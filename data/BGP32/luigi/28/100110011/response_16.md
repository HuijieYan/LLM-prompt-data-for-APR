## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:

1. The `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is expected to determine if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. The function has a conditional statement that checks if a partition is specified or not and then executes the appropriate Hive command.

2. The failing test, `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`, uses mock objects to simulate the behavior of running Hive commands. The test checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function for different scenarios such as table existence, case sensitivity, and partitions.

3. The failed assertion in the test indicates that the expected behavior is not achieved. The error message `AssertionError: False is not true` specifically points to a test case related to case insensitivity.

4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem of case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive, especially when dealing with tables named in different cases. The proposed solution is to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

## Bug cause and suggested fix:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the table name and the output of the Hive command not accounting for case sensitivity. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

To address the bug, we can update the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case differences.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase in the comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case insensitive, addressing the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
