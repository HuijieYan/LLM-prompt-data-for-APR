### Cause of the bug:

The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file not handling case insensitivity correctly. The function compares the table name without considering case, which leads to incorrect results and failing tests when the case of the table name differs from the case returned by Hive.

The failing test clearly demonstrates this issue by showing that the function fails when checking for table existence with a different case.

The GitHub issue #896 highlights this problem and suggests a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing the table name in lowercase with the stdout returned from Hive.

### Fixing the bug:

To address this bug, the `table_exists` function needs to be updated to compare the table name in lowercase with the stdout returned from Hive. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive and returns the correct results.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the table name in lowercase, the corrected function will now correctly handle case insensitivity and pass the failing tests.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896, ensuring that the `table_exists` function behaves correctly in scenarios where the table name is in different cases.
