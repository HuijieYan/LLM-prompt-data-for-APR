## Identification:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `hive.py` file is expected to check if a table exists in the provided database, handling cases where the table name might appear as capitalized or lowercase in the output from Hive.
2. The failure in the test case `test_table_exists` is due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive output.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError: False is not true` at line 111, suggesting that the function is not returning the expected result.
4. The GitHub issues #896 and #1062 mention the problem of the `table_exists` function being case sensitive and propose solutions to make it case insensitive.

## Explanation:
The buggy function fails because it expects the table name to match exactly the case coming from the Hive output. If there is a case mismatch, as in the mentioned test case with "mytable" and "MyTable", it causes the function to return the wrong result.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to use case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists.
2. Update the comparison logic to ensure that the table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner with the tables listed in the Hive output.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        if stdout:
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function includes:
- Using `t.lower() == table.lower()` for comparing the table names in a case-insensitive way.
- Ensure the function returns True if the table is found in the Hive output, else return False.

By making this change, the function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence in the Hive output. This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue identified in the test cases and the corresponding GitHub issues.
