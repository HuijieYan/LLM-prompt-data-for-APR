## Fixing the Bug

### Potential Error Location
The bug is likely present in the comparison statement within the `table_exists` function. The function is currently comparing the table name with the output from Hive command without case-insensitivity handling.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises because the function does not account for case-insensitive table name comparisons with the output from the Hive command. The failing test case tries to assert the existence of a table with varying cases, leading to failures due to case sensitivity.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase, we can ensure a consistent comparison that ignores case differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, we address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.

This correction should enable the function to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised on the GitHub platform.
