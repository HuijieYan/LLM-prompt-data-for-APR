### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing table names in the output against the requested table name. The function does not consider the case of the table names, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The failing test in the provided code tries to assert the existence of a table by calling the `table_exists` function for different table names, including names with varying cases. The bug occurs when the function compares the table names from the output in a case-sensitive manner, leading to AssertionErrors due to incorrect comparisons.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison in the `table_exists` function case insensitive. By converting both the provided table name and the table names in the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function accurately detects the existence of the table regardless of case differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and the table names in the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports (#896 and the case sensitivity concern).
