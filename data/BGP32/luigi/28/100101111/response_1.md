Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing tests, the main issue arises from the case sensitivity in comparing the table names. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output of the command to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check.This correction will address the issue reported on GitHub and make the `table_exists` function behave as expected in all test cases.
