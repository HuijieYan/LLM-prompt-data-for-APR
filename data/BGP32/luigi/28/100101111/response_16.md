### Bug Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The function is comparing the table name directly with the stdout without considering case differences.
3. The failing test cases are due to the inconsistency in table name case handling.
4. The `run_hive_cmd` output is being checked directly against the table name without considering case differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case insensitive.
2. Convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them to ensure consistency.
3. Update the if conditions to account for case insensitive comparisons.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the corrected function will now handle table existence checks accurately. This change resolves the GitHub issue and ensures consistency in table name handling.
