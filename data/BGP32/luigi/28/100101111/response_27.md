### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command and examining the stdout. It fails to correctly handle case insensitivity as mentioned in GitHub issue #896. The failing test case `test_table_exists` is designed to test the functionality of this method, and it reveals that the current implementation does not consider case-insensitive comparisons.

### Error:
The bug arises from the fact that the function does not convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the output from Hive commands. This leads to failing tests when the case of the table name does not match exactly.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive commands are compared in a case-insensitive manner. We will convert both to lowercase before the comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making both the table name and the stdout lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing tests. This fix addresses the issue raised in GitHub and implements the required behavior.
