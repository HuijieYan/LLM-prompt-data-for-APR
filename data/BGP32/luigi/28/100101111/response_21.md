### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the comparison logic of the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the table name is present in the stdout returned from the Hive command. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, causing issues when the table names have different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that Hive is case-insensitive when it comes to table names, but the function `table_exists` in the code is performing a case-sensitive check. This leads to inconsistent behavior depending on the case of the table name provided.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the stdout case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and stdout, we ensure that the check is case-insensitive. This correction aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug reported in the failing test.
