The buggy function `table_exists` fails to handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function does not properly compare the table name with the tables retrieved from the Hive command output.

The bug causes the test cases to fail when expecting the function to correctly detect the table's existence, irrespective of the case of the table name. The function currently compares the table name directly with the tables retrieved from Hive command output without considering case differences.

To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the tables retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the entries in `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue, resolving the bug.
