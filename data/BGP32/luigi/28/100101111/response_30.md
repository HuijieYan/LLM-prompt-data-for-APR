### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails to handle the case sensitivity issue when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
2. The test cases provided in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` demonstrate the failure scenarios due to case sensitivity in table names.
3. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output of Hive commands without considering case differences.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails the test cases because it directly compares the `table` parameter with the contents of `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failures when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the output string from Hive commands.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
