Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue reported on GitHub, and the failing test cases, the bug originates from the fact that the comparison between the existing table names and the provided table names is case-sensitive. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the existing table names and the provided table names to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table names in `stdout` and the provided `table` name to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is now case-insensitive. This change aligns with the reported issue on GitHub (#896) regarding making `table_exists` case-insensitive.

With this change, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values specified.
