### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The existing code does a direct comparison without considering case differences.
2. The failing test cases provide scenarios where the table name case does not match with the output from the Hive command, leading to test failures.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need for making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle such scenarios.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider case insensitivity when checking if the table exists.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
