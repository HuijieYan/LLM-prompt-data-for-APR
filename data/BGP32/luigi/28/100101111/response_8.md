### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks whether a specified table exists in a given database. However, it has a case sensitivity issue where it doesn't handle case differences between the table name and the output from Hive correctly.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` highlights this issue by showing how the function fails to detect the table correctly when there are case differences.
3. The runtime input/output values and expected input/output values show that the function fails to handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.
4. The GitHub issue #896 also addresses this bug and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the table name in lowercase against the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive, making the comparison case insensitive. This modification will align the function's behavior with the expected results and resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By comparing the table name and the output in lowercase, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
