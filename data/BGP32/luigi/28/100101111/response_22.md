### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is comparing the table names without converting them to lowercase, leading to case sensitivity issues.
2. The failing test cases show that the function fails when comparing table names due to case differences.
3. The expected behavior is for the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.
4. We need to modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison to address the case sensitivity problem.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is now case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This correction addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and should now pass the failing test cases.
