### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, leading to test failures.
2. The output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being compared directly with the input table name, which causes case-sensitive comparison issues.
3. The failing tests demonstrate how the current implementation fails to handle case insensitivity, leading to incorrect results when checking for table existence.
4. We can modify the buggy function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
5. By making this adjustment, we can address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

### Code Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence. This modification addresses the reported issue on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
