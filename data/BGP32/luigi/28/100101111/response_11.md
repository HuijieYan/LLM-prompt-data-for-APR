### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without considering case differences. This results in failing test cases when the table names are not matched due to case differences.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison part of the function where it checks if the table name exists in the output from the Hive query.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the direct comparison of the table name without considering case sensitivity. If the table name case is different from the case of the output from the Hive query, the function falsely returns False.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} "
                              f"partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Summary:
The bug was fixed by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive. This correction ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of a table in Hive regardless of case differences.
