### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file fails to correctly identify table existence due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The issue arises when the function compares the table name to the output of the Hive command without considering case differences.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate the failure to recognize table existence with different casing patterns, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix this bug, the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive command output.
5. By implementing a case-insensitive comparison, the function will accurately determine table existence regardless of case variations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Justification:
- In the `table_exists` function, the bug fix includes converting both the table name and the tables listed in the Hive command output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- By modifying the return statement to check if the lowercase table name is in the lowercase stdout, the function ensures accurate detection of table existence irrespective of case variations.
- Implementing this fix aligns with the reported GitHub issue (#896) and resolves the case sensitivity problem in table existence checks.
