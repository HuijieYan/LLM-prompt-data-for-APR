### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in Hive, but the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case sensitive, leading to failing test cases.
2. The buggy function needs modification to make the comparison case insensitive as specified in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly to the output string without considering case sensitivity, resulting in test failures when the cases do not match.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison to ensure it is case insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function will include converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change to the comparison logic in the function, the corrected version will now be able to handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases.
