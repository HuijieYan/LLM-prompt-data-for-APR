The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function compares the table name without handling case differences, which causes the failing test cases.

The issue is related to the fact that Hive is case insensitive, so the function should also be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the lowercase version of the input table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower()` in the comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and correctly checks for the existence of the table regardless of the case used.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to making the table existence check case insensitive.
