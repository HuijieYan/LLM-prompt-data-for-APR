### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the `luigi` module is failing test cases related to table existence checks.
2. The issue seems to be related to case sensitivity in table existence checks, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. The failing tests are not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to test failures.
4. The recommended strategy for fixing the bug is to make the table existence check case insensitive by comparing table names in lowercase.
5. By updating the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, we can address the bug.

### Bug Fix:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the table existence check to compare lowercase table names, the function becomes case insensitive and is able to pass the failing tests. This change aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Now, the corrected function should handle case sensitivity appropriately in table existence checks.
