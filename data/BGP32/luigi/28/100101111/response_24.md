### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a database in Hive.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity - the function currently does a direct comparison of the table name with the output from Hive, which causes issues with case differences.
3. The failing test cases are due to the mismatch in cases of table names causing the function to return the wrong result.
4. The solution involves making the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase.
5. The fix involves modifying the comparison in the function to be case-insensitive.

### Updated Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison, matching the expected behavior.
