### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue. The function does not handle case sensitivity, which causes the tests to fail when the table names are in different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because even if the table name matches the given `table` parameter, the function is checking for an exact match, including case. When the table names are in different cases, the function fails to recognize them as the same table.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them. This way, the comparison will be case insensitive, and the function will correctly identify existing tables regardless of the case.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation:
By converting both the table name (`table`) and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, the function can now correctly determine if the table exists irrespective of the case of the table name. This change aligns with the strategy discussed earlier.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
