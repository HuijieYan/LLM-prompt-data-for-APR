### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check the existence of a table in a Hive database, with an option to specify a partition. However, the function does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to test failures when comparing tables with different case variations.
2. The failing test cases highlight the issue where the function fails to handle case variations in table names.
3. The bug is caused by the function not performing case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to ensure that table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function will include the necessary changes to compare table names in a case-insensitive way.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert table names to lowercase before comparing them with the output from Hive commands. This will ensure case-insensitive comparisons.
2. Update the return statements to compare lowercase table names with the lowercase output from the Hive commands.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))

        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By making these changes, the function will now handle case-insensitive comparisons for table names, fixing the bug identified in the failing tests.
