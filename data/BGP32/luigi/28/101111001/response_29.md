### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from checking if the table exists in the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table name is exactly present in the `stdout`, leading to the failing test cases where the table name is found in the middle of other text in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how we check for the existence of the table in the `stdout`. Instead of looking for an exact match, we should check if the table name is present in the `stdout` regardless of its position among other text.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split("\n"))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `any(table in line for line in stdout.split("\n"))` check, we can verify if the `table` is present in any line of the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function, thus fixing the bug where the table name appears in the middle of other text in the `stdout`.
