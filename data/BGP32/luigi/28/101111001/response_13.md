The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition to check if a table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is not correctly handling the existence of the table. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is evaluating to `False` when it should be `True`. This is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout` output. We can use the `splitlines()` method to split the `stdout` by lines and then check if the `table` is in the list of tables.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, and the failing test cases should now pass.
