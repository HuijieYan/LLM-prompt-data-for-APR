### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the way the condition checking for the existence of the table is implemented. The function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the checks for the table name fail due to inconsistencies in the output format of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

In the failing test cases, the `run_hive_cmd` function is mocked to return different outputs. In Case 2, the output includes both `"OK\nmytable"` which should indicate that the table exists, but the function fails to recognize it. This discrepancy in how the table name is checked against the output causes the tests to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to handle varying formats of the output from `run_hive_cmd`. We should ensure that the function checks for the existence of the table name in a robust manner irrespective of the exact output format.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and (table.lower() in stdout.lower().split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1};'.format(database, table))

        return any(partition.items() <= dict(part.split('=') for part in line.split('/')).items() for line in stdout.split("\n"))
``` 

In the corrected version, we modify the function to consider case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table name in the output. Additionally, when handling partition information, we structure the data in a way that allows for accurate comparison to determine if the partition exists.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify the presence of tables and partitions in the Hive system, resolving the bug and making the failing tests pass.
