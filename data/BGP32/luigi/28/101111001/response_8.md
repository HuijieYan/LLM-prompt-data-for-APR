The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the given `table`. The bug is caused by not considering cases where the table names are similar but not exact matches due to case sensitivity. 

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table names to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
In the corrected version, both the `table` and the names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison to handle case sensitivity issues.

This correction should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
