### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking when `stdout` is not empty. The current implementation checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string, which is not a reliable method as the table name could be part of another string in stdout, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table name is in the `stdout` to ensure we are checking for a complete match instead of a partial match.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

After applying the above correction, the `table_exists` function will correctly check if the table name appears as a whole in the `stdout`, ensuring the accurate detection of table existence. This correction should resolve the failing tests.
