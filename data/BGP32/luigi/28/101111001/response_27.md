### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect conditional check when determining if a table exists. The function checks if the table name is in the output returned by `run_hive_cmd`, but the implementation is flawed. If the table name is found anywhere within the output string, the condition evaluates to `True`, regardless of the context in which the table name appears.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks if the table name appears as a separate word in the output. We can modify the check by using regular expressions to match the table name with word boundaries to avoid matching partial table names.

### Corrected Version:

```python
import re

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(table), stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By using `re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(table), stdout)`, we check if the table name appears as a whole word within the `stdout` string. This prevents partial matches and ensures the correct detection of table existence.
