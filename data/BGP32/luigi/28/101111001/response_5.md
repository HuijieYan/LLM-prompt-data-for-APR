The issue in the buggy function arises from the way the function handles the `stdout` value from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists, but this logic is flawed. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to check if the table name is exactly matched within the `stdout` string, rather than just checking if it is present. 

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
