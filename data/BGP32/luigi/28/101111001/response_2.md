The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the condition checking the existence of the table in the output retrieved from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug originates from the fact that the condition is checking for the presence of the table string in the entire stdout string rather than checking for the exact match.

To fix this bug, the function should split the stdout string by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the list of strings resulting from the split. This way, we ensure that we are comparing the table name with each line separately.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables_list = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will split the stdout string by newline characters, creating a list of strings for each line. Then, it will check if the table name exists in that list, ensuring a more accurate verification of table existence.
