### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the check of whether the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the current implementation, the `stdout` variable is checked for "truthiness" using `stdout and table in stdout`, which can lead to incorrect evaluations. Specifically, when `stdout` is not empty (which is considered "truthy" in Python), the condition may still evaluate to false if the table name is not present in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table name exists in the output. Instead of relying on the truthiness of `stdout`, we should directly check if the table name is in the `stdout`. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version directly checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout` and returns the appropriate boolean value.
