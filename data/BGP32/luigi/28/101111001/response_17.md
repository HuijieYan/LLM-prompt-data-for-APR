The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition checking in the return statement. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists in `stdout`, but it returns the opposite value due to incorrect logic.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `if` condition to correctly return `True` when the table is found in `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By updating the return statement inside the `if` condition, the function should now correctly return `True` if the table exists in the `stdout`.

Run the failing tests again to ensure they pass with this corrected version of the function.
