### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it checks for the existence of a table in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table name is directly present in the `stdout` string, which can lead to false positives or negatives due to partial matches or extra characters. This results in the failing test cases where the expected outcome is not achieved.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` output. Instead of directly checking if the table name is in the `stdout`, we should split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table name is in the resulting list of table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):   
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking if the table name is in the resulting list, we can avoid the issues with partial matches and improve the accuracy of checking for table existence.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
