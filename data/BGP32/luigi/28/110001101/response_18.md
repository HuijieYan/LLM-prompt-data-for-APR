### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is currently checking if the table name is present in the output received from Hive commands, which can lead to false positives or negatives due to inconsistencies in the output format.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from the Hive commands and accurately determines the existence of the table based on that output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the class and function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()  # Check if the table name is in the list of tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if the output is not empty, indicating the table exists
```

By splitting the stdout output into a list of table names in the `if` branch and checking for non-empty output in the `else` branch, we ensure a more accurate determination of table existence based on the output received from the Hive commands.
