### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to how the conditionals are structured. The function checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists. However, in the first conditional branch, when `stdout` is not empty but does not contain the exact table name (e.g., in Case 2), the function incorrectly returns True, indicating that the table exists when it actually doesn't. This leads to incorrect results in multiple test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately check if the table exists based on the full table name in the `stdout` output. One possible approach is to split the `stdout` by newlines and then check if the full table name exists in any of these lines. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function covers all possible edge cases, such as when partition is not None.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                use %s;
                show partitions %s partition (%s);""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return any(partition in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` response by newlines and checking if the table exists based on the full table name in each line, we can accurately determine if the table exists in both cases where partition is None and when partition is specified.
