### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the `stdout` variable is being checked to determine if a table exists. The logic for checking the existence of a table is incorrect in both branches. In the `partition is None` branch, the check `stdout and table in stdout` tries to verify if the table name exists in the output of the command, which is not reliable. Similarly, in the `partition is not None` branch, the function should not just check if `stdout` exists to determine if the table exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in both branches of the `table_exists` function. We should check if the table name exists in the output of the command, and not just if the output exists. Additionally, in the case where there are partitions, we need a more robust way to determine if the requested table exists based on the command output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1}({2});".format(database, table, partitions))
            return stdout and any(partitions in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- The table names are converted to lowercase before comparison to handle case sensitivity.
- When checking for partitions, we use a more thorough search to ensure that the specific partition exists in the output.
