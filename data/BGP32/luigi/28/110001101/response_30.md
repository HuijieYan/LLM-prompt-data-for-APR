The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional statements where the function checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function assumes that the presence of the table name in the stdout indicates that the table exists, which is not always the case. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the table name is in uppercase in the output. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of checking the stdout for the table name existence. We should also consider case insensitivity when comparing table names.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = [table_name.lower() for table_name in stdout.split('\n')]
            return table.lower() in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1};""".format(database, table))
            partitions = [partition_data.lower() for partition_data in stdout.split('\n')]
            partition_spec_lower = self.partition_spec(partition).lower()
            return partition_spec_lower in partitions
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the comparison of table names is case insensitive by converting both the table names in `stdout` and the input `table` to lowercase before comparison. It also handles the correct logic for checking table existence based on the existence of the table name in the output.
