The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to incorrect logic in checking if a table exists in the Hive database. In the first part of the function, when `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the table name is present in the output of the `show tables` command. However, it does not handle the case where the table name might be part of another table's name in the output.

In the second part of the function, when `partition` is not `None`, the function tries to show the partitions of the table, but the specific partition provided is not used correctly to check the existence of the table.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to accurately check for the existence of the table. We can modify the logic to specifically check if the table name is present in the list of table names returned by the `show tables` command, or if the provided partition exists for the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version will accurately check for the existence of the table in the Hive database based on the table name and optional partition provided.
