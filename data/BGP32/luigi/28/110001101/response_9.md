The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the incorrect condition checking the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` does not accurately verify if the table exists in the output. Instead, it should check for an exact match.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to ensure that the table name is checked for an exact match in the output. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` based on newlines and then checking for the table in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` based on newlines and then checks if the `table` name exists in the resulting list, ensuring an exact match. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in all the provided test cases.
