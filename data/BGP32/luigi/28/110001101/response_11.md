The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional logic and how it is handling the `stdout` variable. In both branches of the if-else statement, the function is returning based solely on the truthiness of `stdout`, which may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to check the actual content of `stdout` to determine if the table exists or not.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, we split the `stdout` string on '\n' and check if the `table` exists in the list of tables returned. This way, we are ensuring the correct handling of the output to determine the existence of the table accurately.
