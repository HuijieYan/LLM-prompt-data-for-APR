### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to be in the logic where the function checks if the table is in the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. 

The bug is in the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
In this line, `stdout` is checked for its truthiness before checking if the `table` is in the string. The function erroneously assumes that a non-empty `stdout` always means the table exists, which is incorrect. It should explicitly check if the `table` is in the `stdout`.

Another bug is in the line:
```python
return True if stdout else False
```
This line is redundant and can be simplified to directly return the `stdout`, as it evaluates to `True` when it has content.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function accurately checks whether the `table` exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. We need to modify the logic to explicitly check for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, we directly check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` without relying on the truthiness of `stdout`. The `run_hive_cmd` output is directly returned instead of adding unnecessary conditional checks.
