The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the incorrect comparison and parsing of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function mistakenly checks if the output is not empty instead of properly parsing the tables or partitions returned by the command.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly parse the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function based on the provided input. We should also ensure that the comparison with the table name is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The absolute path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.strip, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version handles both cases of checking for the existence of a table or partition by properly parsing the output of the Hive command and performing a case-insensitive comparison with the target table name.
