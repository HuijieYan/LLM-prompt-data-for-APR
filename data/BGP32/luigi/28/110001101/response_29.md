### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to incorrect comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` returned by running the hive command. The function checks if the `table` name is in `stdout` directly without considering the case sensitivity of the table names. This leads to inconsistency in results when the table names have different casing, causing the function to return incorrect values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure case-insensitive comparison between the `table` name and the tables listed in the `stdout` output. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`, and the provided `table` name is also converted to lowercase using `table.lower()`. This way, a case-insensitive comparison is performed, ensuring accurate results when checking for table existence.
