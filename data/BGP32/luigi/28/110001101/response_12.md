The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the logic that checks for the presence of the table/partition in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation checks for the exact presence of the table/partition name in the output, which may lead to false negatives due to case sensitivity and formatting issues.

To fix this bug, we should modify the function to perform a more robust check for the existence of the table/partition. We can achieve this by splitting the output by newline characters and then checking if the table/partition name exists in any of the lines, regardless of case sensitivity or additional formatting.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and any(table.lower() == line.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, else False
```

This corrected version ensures that the function properly checks for the existence of the table/partition in a case-insensitive manner and handles any additional formatting issues present in the output.
