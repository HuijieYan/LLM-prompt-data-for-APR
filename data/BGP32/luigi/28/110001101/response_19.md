### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `stdout` response from the Hive command executions. The function currently checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists, which may lead to false positives in some cases where the actual output contains additional information.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` response from the Hive command. The current approach of simply checking if the table name is in the `stdout` string may result in incorrect evaluations due to the presence of other table names or information in the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to parse the `stdout` response correctly and ensure that it specifically indicates the existence or absence of the queried table.

### Updated function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables '{1}' like '%{2}%';".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout.split()
```

### Explanation of Fix:
- In the updated version, the `stdout` response is split into a list of table names using the `split()` method.
- We then check if the queried table name exists in this list of table names. This ensures a more accurate check for table existence based on the specified table name.
- For partitioned tables, we modify the Hive command to check for tables that match the specified partition criteria using the `%` wildcard. This allows for a better match with the desired partitioned table name.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles the `stdout` response from the Hive commands and accurately determines the existence of the specified table in the given database.
