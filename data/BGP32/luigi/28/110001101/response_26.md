### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the conditional check on the `stdout` variable. In the first part of the function, the check `stdout and table in stdout` is used to determine if the table exists. However, this approach is flawed because even if `stdout` contains the table name, but there are additional characters or information present, the check will fail.

In the second part of the function, the `if stdout` check is also unreliable because `stdout` might not return a boolean value when checked directly.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the function. We can parse the output `stdout` to extract only the relevant information before performing the table existence check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this fix, we split the `stdout` by lines before checking the presence of the table name, ensuring more accurate results. Additionally, the `bool(stdout)` in the else part ensures that the function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty.
