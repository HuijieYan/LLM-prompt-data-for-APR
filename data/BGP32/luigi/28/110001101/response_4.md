The bug in the `table_exists` function is mainly due to the condition being checked for the existence of the table in the stdout. The function returns `True` if the `stdout` variable is not empty, regardless of whether the table is actually in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to properly check if the table exists in the `stdout` for both cases when `partition` is `None` and when it's not. We can do this by splitting the stdout string by newline characters and then checking if the table exists in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in partitions
```

This corrected version properly checks if the table exists in the output before returning `True`.
