### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition checks for the existence of a table or partition. In both cases, the function incorrectly returns based on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable, which may not accurately indicate table or partition existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statements to properly check if the table or partition actually exists based on the `stdout` output from running the Hive commands. We should explicitly check for the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

By splitting the `stdout` string and checking if the table name is in the list of tables in the corrected version, we ensure a more accurate detection of table existence. Similarly, for partition existence, we check if the stripped `stdout` string is not empty, indicating the existence of partitions.
