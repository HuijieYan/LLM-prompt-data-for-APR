The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not implemented correctly. There are issues with how the function checks for the existence of a table in the given database and partition.

The bug is caused by the way the function checks the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first condition, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout` string. However, in the second condition, the function only checks if `stdout` is not empty. This inconsistency can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to consistently check the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists in both conditions. We should modify the second condition to also check if the `table` is in the `stdout` string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if not partition:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

This fix ensures that the function properly checks if the table exists in the provided database and partition, providing consistent behavior and correct results for all cases mentioned.
