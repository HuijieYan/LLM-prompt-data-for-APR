The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic, where it checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table in stdout` check is not handling the case sensitivity properly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, fixing the bug that caused the failing tests.
