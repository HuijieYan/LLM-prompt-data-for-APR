The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the way it checks for the existence of a table in the `stdout` variable. The current implementation checks if the table name is directly in `stdout` without considering the formatting or case-sensitivity. This leads to incorrect results, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic of checking the existence of the table in the output obtained from running the hive command. We should consider checking for the table name in a case-insensitive manner and check if it appears as a separate word.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None

```

In the corrected version:
1. We convert both the table name and the output `stdout` to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
2. We split the `stdout` by space and look for the table name as a separate word, ensuring accurate identification.
3. We modify the return statements to return boolean values based on the presence of the table in the `stdout`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases by properly checking for the table existence, regardless of case-sensitivity or formatting.
