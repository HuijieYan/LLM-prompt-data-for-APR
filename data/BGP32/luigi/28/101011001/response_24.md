The issue in the buggy function lies in the condition checking of the returned stdout for the existence of the table. The function currently checks if the table name is in the stdout string, which may lead to incorrect results due to substring matches.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check for exact matches of the table name in the stdout string.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout string and checking for an exact match of the table name in the list of table names returned by the `show tables` command, the corrected function should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing tests.
