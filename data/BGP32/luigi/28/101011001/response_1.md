The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is due to the way the return value is checked against the presence of the table within the `stdout` string. The logic to check for the table's existence is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The code currently tries to match the whole table name in the `stdout`, which is causing the test failures. Instead, we should be parsing the `stdout` to properly check for the existence of the table within it.

### Bug in the code:
The buggy function checks the entire `stdout` against the table name for existence, leading to incorrect results when the expected table name is just a part of the `stdout`.

### Fix strategy:
1. Modify the logic to parse the `stdout` appropriately to check for the existence of the table.
2. Use a more robust check to ensure that the table name is distinct within the `stdout`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function splits the `stdout` by spaces to obtain separate elements and then checks if the `table` is present in that list of elements. This correction ensures a robust check for the table's existence within the obtained output.
