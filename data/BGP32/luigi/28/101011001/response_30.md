The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the fact that the condition to check if the table exists is not handling the case-insensitivity of the table name properly. The function is comparing the table name directly without considering the case difference, leading to the test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the `stdout` output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the updated version, we modify the condition to check if the table exists by comparing the lowercase version of both the table names. By doing this, we make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function behaves correctly with tables names that vary only in case.

This correction should address the issues described and make the tests pass.
