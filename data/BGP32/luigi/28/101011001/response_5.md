### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` output after running the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug causes incorrect evaluation of the presence of a table. The function is not checking for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` output, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly checks for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout` output.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

The corrected version splits the `stdout` output by newline character to ensure exact table name comparison. Additionally, the return statement is simplified to directly return the boolean result of whether `stdout` is empty or not.
