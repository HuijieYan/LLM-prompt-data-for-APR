### Issues in the buggy function:

1. The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity correctly. It compares the table names without considering case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Modify the comparison operation in the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity by converting both table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function correctly handles case insensitivity during the table existence check. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
