### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The function makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the stdout is processed to determine if the table exists.
3. In all failing cases, the function is returning False when it should be returning True based on the provided stdout values.
4. It seems that the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not correctly handling the newline characters in the output.
5. We need to modify the condition to account for the variations in the `stdout` value in order to correctly determine if the table exists.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when checking `stdout` to account for newline characters. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the stdout on the newline character, we can handle cases where the `stdout` contains multiple lines. This should correctly identify if the table exists based on the stdout value.
