The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is related to the comparison of the table name returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function to the input table name. The buggy function is expecting an exact match, however, the returned table names may contain additional characters or new lines, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `table_exists` function to perform a more robust comparison. We can modify the comparison to check if the table name is contained within the returned string, instead of a direct equality check. This approach will handle cases where additional characters or new lines are present in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

With the above correction, the function now checks if the table name is contained in each line of the returned output, allowing for a more flexible comparison.

This fix should address the failing test cases provided, where the table names are not a direct match due to additional characters or formatting.
