### Analysis

The buggy function `table_exists` has a problem with how it checks for the existence of a table. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks if the table name is in the output of the command. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the case sensitivity of the table names.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This results in incorrect comparisons leading to failing test cases.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for case sensitivity. One way to fix this issue is to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases related to case sensitivity.
