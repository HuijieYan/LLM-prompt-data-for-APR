### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how the function checks if a table exists in the database. The issue arises from the comparison logic in the `if` condition where the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

In the failing tests, the bug causes the comparison to fail when the expected table name is provided in a different case (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable') because the comparison is case-sensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the tables listed in the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Updated Outcome:
After implementing the above fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons and pass the failing tests provided.
