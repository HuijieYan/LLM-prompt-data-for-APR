### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. It relies on checking whether the `table` is in the output (`stdout`) returned by running the `hive` command. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the input table name is in a different case from the returned table name. 

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the comparison using `table in stdout`, which is case-sensitive. So when the input table name differs in case from the returned table name, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect test results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the list of tables returned by the `hive` command. This way, regardless of the case of the input table name or the returned table names, the comparison will yield the correct result.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table_lower in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this updated version, we first convert the input table name to lowercase to ensure a consistent comparison. Then, when checking if the table exists in the output, we use a case-insensitive comparison by converting both table names to lowercase. This should resolve the bug and ensure the tests pass correctly.
