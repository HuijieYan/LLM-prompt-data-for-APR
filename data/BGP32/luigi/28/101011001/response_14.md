### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it determines if a table exists in the Hive database. The function checks the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable after running a Hive command. The issue arises because the `stdout` variable might contain multiple lines, and the current implementation only checks if the table name is present in `stdout`.

In Case 2, the `stdout` variable contains `OK\nmytable`, which results in the function incorrectly returning `True` because it only checks for the presence of `table` in `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable. Instead of just checking for direct equality, we need to split the lines in `stdout` and then check if any line exactly matches the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

``` 

By splitting the `stdout` variable into lines and performing an exact match with the table name for each line, we ensure accurate detection of the table's existence in the Hive database. This corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
