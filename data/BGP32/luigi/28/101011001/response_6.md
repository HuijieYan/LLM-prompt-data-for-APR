### Bug Analysis

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks if the table exists in the database. When the `run_hive_cmd` function is called to get the table names or partitions, the comparison with the actual table name is not correctly handled. In particular, the check for table existence is flawed.

1. When looking for a table, the function checks if the table name is directly present in the output `stdout`, which is incorrect. This approach does not handle cases where there can be other names present in the `stdout` along with the table name.

2. The function doesn't handle case-insensitivity when checking for table existence. The comparison should be case-insensitive to correctly determine whether the table exists or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function:

1. Modify the logic to compare the extracted table names from the command output with the provided `table` name.

2. Ensure a case-insensitive comparison is conducted to accurately determine if the table exists. 

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            partition_columns = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_columns))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version:
- After getting the table names from the command output, a case-insensitive comparison is performed to check if the desired table exists in the list of tables.
- In the else block, the partition columns are correctly retrieved, and the check for partition existence is done by checking if the stdout is not empty. This accounts for the existence of partitions.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
