The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison condition for checking table existence. The function checks if the table name exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but the comparison is incorrect in handling the case where the table name is part of a larger string in the output.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function checks for the exact match of the table name in stdout, which is not correct. The function should check if the table name is present in the output string, not an exact match.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the test includes scenarios where the table name is part of a larger string in the stdout. The function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the existing condition to check if the table name is present in the output string rather than an exact match.
2. Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from the output string before performing the comparison to avoid false negatives.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the condition to check for the presence of the table name in the output string and ensuring proper handling of whitespace, the corrected function should pass the failing tests.
