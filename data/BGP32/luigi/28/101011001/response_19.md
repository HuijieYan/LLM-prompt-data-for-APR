### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The comparison `table in stdout` is unreliable because if the table name is a substring of another table name in the output, it could lead to incorrect results. This is evident in the failing test cases where the expected table name is present as a substring in one of the tables in the `stdout`, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that the exact table name is present in the output. One way to achieve this is to split the `stdout` by newline characters and compare each line separately with the table name. This approach will guarantee that we are checking for an exact match of the table name in the list of tables provided by `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and comparing each line individually against the table name, we ensure that the function accurately determines the existence of the specified table. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and provide the expected outcomes.
