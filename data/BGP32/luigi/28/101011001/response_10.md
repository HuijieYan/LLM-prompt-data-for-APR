The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. The buggy comparison `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect because it only checks if both `stdout` is not empty and `table` is a substring of `stdout`. Instead, the correct approach should be to split the lines of `stdout` and compare each line with the `table`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return True if stdout else False
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable based on lines and comparing each line with the `table` name, the corrected function ensures accurate checking of whether the table exists in the database. This correction should make the function behave as intended and pass the failing test cases.
