The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the condition checking in the return statement. The bug occurs because the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. The function should check if the table name exists in the output, not just if the output exists.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to check if the table name is in the stdout after splitting the result by newline character '\n'. This way, we ensure that we are correctly checking for the presence of the table in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by '\n' and checking if the table exists in the resulting list, we ensure that the function correctly identifies if the table is present. This modification should fix the bug and make the failing tests pass.
