### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests because it incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue lies in the comparison where it checks if the table name is included in `stdout`. 

In the failing cases provided:
- Case 1: The `stdout` is `'OK'`, and the table name is `'mytable'`. The buggy function mistakenly returns `False` because `'mytable'` is not present in `'OK'`.
- Case 2: The `stdout` is `'OK\nmytable'` (with the table name 'mytable' on a new line), and the table name is `'MyTable'`. The buggy function mistakenly returns `False` because it does not account for case sensitivity and distinct lines.
- Case 3: Same as Case 1.
- Case 4: Same as Case 2.

### Fix Strategy

To address the issues mentioned above, we need to fix the comparison mechanism in the `table_exists` function. We should modify the function so that it properly checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function with case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We split the `stdout` by lines in the first case and check each line for a match with the table name in a case-insensitive manner using `lower()`.
2. We return `True` if `stdout` is not empty in the second case instead of explicitly checking the content, as any non-empty string should indicate the table exists.

This correction should resolve the issues with the failing tests.
