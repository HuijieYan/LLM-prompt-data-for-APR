### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison operation used to determine if the table exists in the Hive database. The function first runs a command to check for table existence, and then it checks if the table name is present in the returned output. However, the bug is caused by the way this comparison is done. The function checks if `table in stdout` to determine table existence, which can lead to incorrect results due to partial matching. In the failing tests, we see cases where the function incorrectly returns `False` for existing tables due to partial matching issues.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison operation to ensure an exact match between the table name and the output of the command. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then checking if the table name matches any of the lines exactly. This way, we avoid partial matching issues that are causing the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary module
import re

# Buggy function with the bug fix
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(re.search(r'^%s$' % table, stdout, re.M))
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then performing an exact match comparison in the first case, and using regular expression to match exactly in the second case, we ensure that the function correctly identifies table existence without partial matching errors.
