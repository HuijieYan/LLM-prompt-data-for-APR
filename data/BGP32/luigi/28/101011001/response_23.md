### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of the table in the output of the command run in `stdout`.

### Bug
The bug in the function lies in the conditional check for `table in stdout`. In the case where the table name includes uppercase characters, the comparison fails because the comparison does not handle case insensitivity, leading to the function returning the incorrect result.

### Fix
To fix the bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, we can modify the conditional check when comparing the table name in the output. We can convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With the modification to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
