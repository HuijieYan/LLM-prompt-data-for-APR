The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it doesn't handle the case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub issue provided, where there are scenarios where tables with capitalized names fail the test due to case insensitivity in Hive.

The problem arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, where the table names may not match due to case differences. The function currently checks if the exact table name exists in the output, leading to failures when the case doesn't match.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This adjustment ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
