### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the provided code does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names. This issue is outlined in the GitHub issues where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid problems with table names that have different capitalization.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug in the function lies in how it compares the table name in the `stdout` variable with the input table name using the `in` operator without considering case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table names directly without converting them to a consistent case. This causes the comparison to fail when the capitalization of the table names differs between the input and the results from Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the input table name and the table names retrieved from Hive to a consistent case, such as lowercase, before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} PARTITION ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, both the input table name and the table names retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase before the comparison is made. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub discussion.
