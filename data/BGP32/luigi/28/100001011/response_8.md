The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is checking for table existence in a case-sensitive manner, causing issues when the case of the table name differs. To fix this issue, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Bug Analysis:
The bug stems from the comparison of the `table` name without considering the case, leading to false negatives when the cases do not match between the `table` name and the output from the Hive command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, we should convert both the `table` name and the output `stdout` to lowercase before comparing. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison for checking the table existence.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence, fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
