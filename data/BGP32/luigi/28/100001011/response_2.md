The bug in the existing `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive stdout. This issue is identified in the GitHub issue where tables defined with capitalized names return in lowercase in stdout, leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive when checking for table existence. We need to convert both the table name being checked and the stdout result to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the table name being checked and the stdout result are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- The `bool(stdout)` function is used to return True if `stdout` is not empty, instead of separate return statements.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles case insensitive comparison when checking for table existence in Hive.
