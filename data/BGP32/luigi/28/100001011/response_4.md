The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to test failures when tables are defined with different capitalization.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to compare the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive in lowercase, making the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables in Hive regardless of their capitalization. The comparison is now performed on lowercase versions of the table names and Hive output to handle case sensitivity issues.
