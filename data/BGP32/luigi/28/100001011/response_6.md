The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output received from the Hive command. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity. Hive treats table names in a case-insensitive manner, leading to mismatches when comparing the table name with the output. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the `table` name and `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This approach ensures that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case of the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that case sensitivity does not affect the result. This modification aligns with the suggested fix on the GitHub issue and eliminates the bug related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
