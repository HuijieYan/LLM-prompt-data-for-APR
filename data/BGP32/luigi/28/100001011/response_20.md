The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it checks for the existence of a table in Hive but does not take into consideration the case sensitivity of table names, leading to test failures when the table names are in different case variations. The proposed fix for this issue is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both table names to lowercase during comparison, the function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, addressing the GitHub issue and resolving the bug.
