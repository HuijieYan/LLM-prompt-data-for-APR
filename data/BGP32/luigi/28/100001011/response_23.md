### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. The function checks if the table name exists in the output as is, leading to failures when the cases do not match. The GitHub issue suggests making the comparison case-insensitive to resolve this issue.

### Error Locations:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the comparison of `table in stdout` is case-sensitive.
2. In the `else` block, the comparison of the existence of partitions is also case-sensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails because it does a direct comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, which may have a different case due to Hive's case-insensitive nature. This discrepancy in case causes the function to incorrectly determine the existence of the table, leading to failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, modify the function to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version uses `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for comparison, making it case-insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.
