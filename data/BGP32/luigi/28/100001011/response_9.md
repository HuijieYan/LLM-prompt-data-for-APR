The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it compares the table name without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures reported in the GitHub issue related to capitalization of table names in Hive.

### Error Locations:
1. The buggy function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table, which causes inconsistent behavior due to case differences in the input and output names.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the function does not convert the table name to lowercase for comparison when checking if the table exists, leading to false negatives.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This results in inconsistencies when comparing table names in different cases, causing tests to fail inconsistently.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the table name and the output from Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can address the issue of case sensitivity effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report regarding case sensitivity.
