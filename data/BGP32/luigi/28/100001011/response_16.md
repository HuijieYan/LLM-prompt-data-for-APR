### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The function compares the table name to the output from Hive without considering the case issue.
- The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests that table names can be in any case, but Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, leading to failures in tests when comparing table names.
- The function should be modified to make it case insensitive by comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the stdout from Hive without considering the case sensitivity. If the table names are different in case (uppercase, lowercase), the comparison fails, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
