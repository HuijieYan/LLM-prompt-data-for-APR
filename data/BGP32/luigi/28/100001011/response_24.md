### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name with the output from Hive without converting them to the same case.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of `table` with `stdout` without case normalization.
2. Inconsistency in handling table names and output from Hive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may have different cases. For example, a table named 'MyTable' might be returned by Hive as 'mytable', leading to a failure in the function's logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to normalize the case of both the table name and the output from Hive before comparison. By converting both to lowercase, we can make the comparison case-insensitive irrespective of how Hive returns the table names.

### Code Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function includes converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
