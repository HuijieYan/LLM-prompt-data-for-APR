The bug in the provided code is that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case sensitive, causing the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name does not match the case of the returned table names from Hive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the names in the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we convert both the `table` parameter and the returned table names from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This modification makes the comparison case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
