In the provided buggy function, the issue stems from the comparison between the table names. The table names can be in different cases, which leads to the comparison failing. Specifically, the function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout`, but the comparison does not consider the case sensitivity of the table names.

To fix this bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison, we can ensure that the function works correctly, regardless of the case of the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using `lower()` before the comparison. This change ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for the table existence, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and making the function more robust.
