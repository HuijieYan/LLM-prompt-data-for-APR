The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function currently checks for an exact match between the table name and the output obtained from running a Hive command. However, Hive is case insensitive, so table names might come back in lowercase causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we can change the comparison to ensure that we are comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output. This modification will make the comparison case insensitive and address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of both the table name and the retrieved output, the function will be able to accurately determine if the table exists in Hive regardless of the case sensitivity issues.
