### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in luigi/contrib/hive.py fails to consider case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. This causes issues when table names are capitalized differently than expected due to Hive being case insensitive. The proposed solution in the GitHub issue is to check the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase of the result from Hive.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the comparison of table names between the input and the retrieved table names from Hive.
2. In the handling of case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. Inconsistencies in how table names are treated in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing table names fetched from Hive with the input table name. Due to Hive's case insensitivity, the function may fail to identify existing tables if there are variations in capitalization between the input and the Hive result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the input table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive match and prevent issues related to differences in capitalization.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
- The input table name `table` is converted to lowercase using `table.lower()` when querying Hive.
- Both `table` and the retrieved table names from Hive are compared in lowercase using `lower()` to ensure a case-insensitive match.
- This modification aligns with the suggested approach in the GitHub issue to address the case sensitivity problem when checking table existence in Hive.
