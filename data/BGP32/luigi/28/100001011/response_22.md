The buggy function `table_exists` is failing due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function is not considering the case of the table names, leading to incorrect results. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests making the function case insensitive by comparing table names in lowercase.

The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to case mismatch errors.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison. This way, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison, ensuring that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should resolve the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
