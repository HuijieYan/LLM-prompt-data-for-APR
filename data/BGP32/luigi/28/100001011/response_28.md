The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it checks for the exact case-sensitive match between the `table` name and the results obtained from the `stdout` variable, which might not match due to case differences.

The issue outlined in the GitHub description highlights the need for the function to be case insensitive when comparing the `table` name with the results retrieved from `stdout`.

To address the bug, we can modify the function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them. This adjustment will ensure a case-insensitive match.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` comparison ensures that the `table` name and the `stdout` output are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This adjustment addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
