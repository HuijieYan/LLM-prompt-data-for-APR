### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has an issue where it doesn't handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. This causes problems when comparing the table name provided as input with the actual table names in the database, as Hive is case insensitive and may return lowercase table names.

### Identified Error:
The bug arises from the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
When the `stdout` contains the table names, if the case of the table name mismatches with the provided `table` variable, the comparison fails, resulting in incorrect output. This issue was not evident in older versions where the check was different.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the table name and the names retrieved from `stdout` is case insensitive. By converting both to lowercase before comparison, we can accurately check if a table exists in the Hive database irrespective of the case.

### Corrected Code:

```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly identify if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
