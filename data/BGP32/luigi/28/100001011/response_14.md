The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug where it doesn't handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names. This bug causes the function to fail when checking for table existence if the case of the table names doesn't match.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner. When the table name provided in the function call is different in cases (e.g., 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable'), the function fails to recognize the table's existence due to case mismatch.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output (`stdout`) to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will allow the function to correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case used.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

By making this adjustment, the `table_exists` function will now correctly determine the existence of the table irrespective of the case of the table name provided.
