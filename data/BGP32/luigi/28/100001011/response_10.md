The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name retrieved from the `stdout` with the input table name. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, Hive is case insensitive, so the comparison needs to take that into account.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` retrieved from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we convert both the input table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub comments.
