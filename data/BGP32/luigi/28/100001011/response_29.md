The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. This causes the function to incorrectly determine the existence of tables with different cases than the input.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive table existence checks as reported in the GitHub issue. This modification ensures that tables with different cases are appropriately recognized by the function.
