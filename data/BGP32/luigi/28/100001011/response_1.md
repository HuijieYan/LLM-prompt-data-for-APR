The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file of the Luigi library. The function is intended to check if a specified table exists within a specified database in Hive. The bug arises due to a case sensitivity issue where the table names are compared without considering case differences.

### Error Location:
The bug lies in the comparison between the provided table name and the table names obtained from the Hive output. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to false negatives when the cases do not match.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the function to fail when the table name casing in the Hive output does not match the provided table name casing. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you need to enforce case-insensitivity when comparing the table names. By converting both the provided table name and the Hive output table names to lowercase, you can ensure a correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table names obtained from Hive to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and aligns with the expected behavior for case sensitivity in table existence checks.
