### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
- The bug is related to case sensitivity in table names. The function does not handle case insensitivity, causing the tests to fail when comparing different cases of table names.
- The expected behavior is to check for table existence irrespective of the case of the table name.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case-sensitive.
- The failing tests for `table_exists` fail when the table name case does not match the case in the `stdout`.
- The bug exists in both cases where `table_exists` is called with or without a partition.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.
- Modify the return statement to check if the lowercase table name is in the lowercase `stdout` string.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change to the function, it will now correctly handle case insensitivity while checking for table existence in the Hive database. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
