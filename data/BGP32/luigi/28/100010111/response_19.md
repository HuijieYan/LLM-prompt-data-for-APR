### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is incorrectly comparing the table names without considering case sensitivity.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to assertion failures.
3. The expected input/output values suggest that the table names should be compared in a case-insensitive manner.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle case insensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing table names from the command output against the provided table name.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparing to ensure case insensitivity.
2. Update the `if` conditions to use case-insensitive comparisons.
3. Update the function to return `table in stdout.lower()` for checking table existence.
4. Make sure to modify both the partitioned and unpartitioned cases for consistency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By making the comparisons case-insensitive by converting both table names and command outputs to lowercase, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values as well as resolve the GitHub issue.
