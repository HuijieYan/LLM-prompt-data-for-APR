### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The bug is causing the function to fail when comparing table names.
3. The failing tests highlight the case sensitivity issue between provided table names in uppercase or lowercase and the expected comparison with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. The expected behavior is to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the comparison between table names and the `stdout` to be case insensitive.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Update the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` to be case insensitive.
2. Use lowercase versions of both the table name and the `stdout` for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive check
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout is not None
```

By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive by using lowercase versions of table name and `stdout`, the corrected function should now pass all the failing tests.
