### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output for the presence of the table.
3. The bug arises due to case sensitivity in table names. The function doesn't handle case insensitivity for table names, leading to test failures when table names don't match case exactly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive.

### Change Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison check to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to handle case insensitivity in table name comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function includes converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive match. This modification should resolve the bug and pass all the test cases, including the ones mentioned in the GitHub issue.
