### Analyzing the Bug

- The buggy function is `table_exists`.
- The error message indicates that the returned value is incorrect during the test cases.
- Expected input/output values are provided for different test cases.
- There is a GitHub issue addressing the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
- The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing table names.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

- The bug might be caused by a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command.
- Incorrect handling of case sensitivity in the string comparison could lead to failing test cases.

### Explanation of the Bug

- The buggy function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
- Since Hive is case insensitive, the output may not match the table name due to case differences, leading to incorrect results.
- The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case insensitive.
- By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we can address the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary of Changes Made
- Converted both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function.
- By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue.
