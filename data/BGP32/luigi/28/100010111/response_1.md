### 1. Analyzing the buggy function and error message
- The buggy function is `table_exists` within `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
- The error message is showing that the test case is failing because the returned value is incorrect.
- The expected input/output values for the function are mentioned in the failing test cases.
- The GitHub issue #896 indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

### 2. Potential error locations
- The bug might be related to case sensitivity while checking the table existence.
- The comparison between the table name and the values in `stdout` may not be handled correctly.

### 3. Cause of the bug
The bug arises from the function not being case insensitive when checking for table existence. The function checks if the table name exactly matches the table name in the output, leading to failures when there are differences in case.

### 4. Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the values in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### 5. Corrected version of the function

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the comparison for table existence is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both table names to lowercase before comparison. This modification fixes the bug and lets the function return the expected values in the failing test cases.
