### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is failing the test cases because it's not handling case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
- The error message shows that for case-insensitive table names like `MyTable`, the function is failing to identify them correctly.
- Based on the expected input/output values, the function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output to ensure case insensitivity.
- The GitHub issue #896 also mentions the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive, which returns table names in lowercase.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not considering case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. Since Hive converts table names to lowercase, the function fails to correctly identify tables with different case variations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive:
- Convert the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
- Update the function to check for lowercase versions of the table name and the output to match the behavior of Hive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to compare lowercase versions of the table name and the output, the corrected version now handles case insensitivity correctly and should pass all the expected test cases.
