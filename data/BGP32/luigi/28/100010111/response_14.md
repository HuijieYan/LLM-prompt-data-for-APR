### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison between the `table` name and the table names retrieved from the `stdout`. This comparison may fail due to case sensitivity issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the fact that the `table` names retrieved from `stdout` are in lowercase, whereas the `table` name provided to the function may be in a different case. This creates a mismatch in the comparison, leading to failed assertions in the test cases.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the table names retrieved from `stdout` is case-insensitive. One way to address this is to convert both strings to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the table names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check and address the bug reported in the failing test cases.
