### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in Hive by calling `run_hive_cmd` with a query.
- The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names. The test cases are failing due to differences in case between the table name in `stdout` and the expected table name.
- The GitHub issue mentions the same problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing the table names in lowercase.
- To fix the bug, we will convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Convert the `table` variable to lowercase before forming the query.
- Convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison before returning.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
```

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
