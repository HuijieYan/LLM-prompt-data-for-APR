### Analyze the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. The function checks whether a table exists in a given database. The error message shows failing tests where assertions for `assertTrue` are not passing.

### Identify potential error locations

The potential error location in the `table_exists` function is the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. The function might be failing to handle case sensitivity properly.

### Explain the cause of the bug

The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function returns `False` if the table is not found in the Hive command output exactly as provided in the function call, leading to failing tests when the table names' case differs.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase for accurate matching.

### The corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check. This modification will resolve the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues.
