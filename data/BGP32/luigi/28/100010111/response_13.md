### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in Hive by running a Hive command and parsing the output.
2. The function has two branches, one for checking without a partition and another for checking with a partition.
3. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons causing the test to fail.
4. The suggested fix is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both table name and output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the output of the Hive command. The test cases have table names in different cases than what is returned by Hive commands.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the bug related to table name case sensitivity.
