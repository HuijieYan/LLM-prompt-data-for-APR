### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a specified database in Hive.
2. The failing test cases are focused on asserting the functionality of the `table_exists` function with different input parameters.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly.
4. The failing test cases aim to verify the behavior of the `table_exists` function when checking for tables with different case variations.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive with the table names provided as input. When the input table name is in a different case than the retrieved table name, the function fails to accurately determine table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of table names is case-insensitive. One approach to resolving this issue would be to convert both the table name provided as input and the table name retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected function now converts both the input table name (`table`) and the tables retrieved from Hive (`stdout`) to lowercase before comparing them. This modification ensures a case-insensitive comparison for accurate table existence checking.
