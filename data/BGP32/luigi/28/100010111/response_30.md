### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The error occurs when running the test cases in the `HiveCommandClientTest` class, where the function returns unexpected values. Based on the error messages, it seems that the issue lies in how table names are compared with the output from the Hive command.

The failing test cases indicate that the `table_exists` function is not handling case insensitivity properly when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This leads to assertion errors in the test cases where the table names have different cases.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The condition `table in stdout` does not account for case sensitivity.
2. The use of `stdout` directly in the return statement without any lower case transformations.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The cause of the bug is the lack of case insensitivity handling in the comparison between the expected table name and the actual table name from the Hive command output. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should convert both names to a consistent case format before the comparison. As a result, the test cases fail when the table names have different cases, leading to the assertion errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug:
1. Convert both the table name and the table names in the Hive output to lowercase for case insensitivity.
2. Update the return statements to use lowercase table names for comparison.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_lower = table.lower()
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        table_lower = table.lower()
        if stdout:
            return table_lower in stdout.lower()
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the expected table name and the table names from the Hive output to lowercase before comparison. This modification ensures case insensitivity and resolves the assertion errors encountered in the failing test cases.
