### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The failing tests indicate that the function is not properly handling case sensitivity issues. The expected values show that the function needs to be case insensitive when comparing the table names.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely caused by the comparison between the input `table` name and the names returned in the `stdout` variable. The issue arises due to case sensitivity in these comparisons.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function compares the exact case of the table name passed as an argument with the names returned by Hive in `stdout`. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns everything in lowercase, the function fails to correctly identify the table existence based on case differences.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the input `table` name and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the function behaves as expected when dealing with case differences.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function converts both the `table` name and the names in the `stdout` variable to lowercase before comparing them. This modification ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking the existence of tables in the Hive database.
