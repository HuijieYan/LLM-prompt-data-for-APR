### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity issue. It is directly comparing the table name with the stdout, leading to test failures when the case does not match.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling the case sensitivity correctly, causing assertions to fail when comparing table names.
3. The expected input/output variable values indicate that the function needs to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing with the stdout to ensure case insensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase using `lower()` before comparing with the stdout.
2. Also, convert the stdout to lowercase before checking if the table name exists in it.
3. By making both comparisons lowercase, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and resolves the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence, resolving the failing test cases.
