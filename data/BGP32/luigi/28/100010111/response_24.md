### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks the existence of a table in a Hive database. The bug appears to be due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
2. The error message indicates that the test fails due to false assertions.
3. The bug causes the function to return False when it should return True. This is because the function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected function should ensure that the comparison between table names is case-insensitive to match the behavior of Hive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is case-insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
