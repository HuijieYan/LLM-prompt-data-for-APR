### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a given table exists in a database by running a Hive command and inspecting the output.
- The bug occurs due to a case sensitivity issue where the comparison between the `table` parameter and the tables listed in the stdout is case-sensitive.
- The expected behavior is for the comparison to be case-insensitive.
- The GitHub issue #896 highlights this problem and suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison between the `table` parameter and the tables listed in the stdout not being case-insensitive. This leads to failures in the test cases where the capitalization of the table names is different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` parameter and the tables listed in the stdout to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will now handle case-insensitive table existence checks. This modification will address the bug and align with the expectation outlined in the GitHub issue.
