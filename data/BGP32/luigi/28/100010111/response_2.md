### Analysis:
The provided function has a bug related to case sensitivity. The function compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when table names have different cases. This issue was raised on GitHub as Issue #896.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the function is the comparison between the table name and the stdout without considering the case of the table name, leading to false assertions in the test cases due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

Now, the provided test cases should pass, and the function properly handles the case sensitivity of table names in Hive.
