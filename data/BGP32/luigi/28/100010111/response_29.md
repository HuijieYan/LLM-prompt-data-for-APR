### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It is intended to check if a table exists in a database. The error message indicates that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests.

The failing test cases involve checking for the existence of tables with different case variations (`mytable`, `MyTable`, etc.). The function is supposed to be case-insensitive, but it currently fails to account for different cases.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. In the comparison of `table` with the `stdout` output, the case sensitivity is not handled correctly.
2. The function should convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison to make it case-insensitive.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the input `table` with the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table names may appear in lowercase in the `stdout`, leading to false negatives in the comparison.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.
