### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` checks whether a table exists in a Hive database based on the given parameters like `table`, `database`, and `partition`.
- The bug causes the function to return the wrong output, leading to failing tests.
- The failing tests expect the function to be case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

### Error Cause:
- The bug originates from the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive queries.
- For example, if a table is named 'MyTable' but returned by Hive as 'mytable', the function fails to recognize them as equal due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure the comparison between the table name and the table name returned by Hive queries is case insensitive.
- We can convert both table names to lowercase before comparison to resolve the issue.

### Updated Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we make the function case insensitive, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior mentioned in the failing tests.
