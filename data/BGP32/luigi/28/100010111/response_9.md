### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in the specified database. The bug occurs when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity issues.
- The expected cases provided suggest that the function should consider case insensitivity when comparing the table names.
- The error messages indicate that the test cases fail due to incorrect comparison results when the table names have different casing than expected in the stdout.
- The GitHub issue related to this bug suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve the problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not considering case insensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the table names retrieved from the Hive database. This leads to assertions failing since the comparison results are case sensitive.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison of table names is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Revised Function:
- The corrected function ensures that both the provided table name and the table names retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison.
- This adjustment makes the comparison case insensitive, addressing the issue of failing assertions when table names have different casing.
