### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
- The function has two branches: one for when `partition` is `None` and another for when `partition` is not `None`.
- In the failing test cases, the issue is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
- The expected values for stdout might differ due to the case sensitivity issue.
- The issue on GitHub suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused because the function is not handling the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists.
- When the table name in the function call and the actual table name in the database don't match due to case sensitivity, the function fails to return the correct result.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix this issue, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from Hive commands case insensitive.
- Convert both the table name and the tables retrieved from stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be case insensitive and should pass the failing test cases and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
