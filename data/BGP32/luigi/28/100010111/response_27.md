### Buggy Function Analysis:
The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of tables. The failing tests indicate that the function fails to correctly identify table names due to case sensitivity.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the output string may not be handling case insensitivity correctly.
2. The handling of upper and lower case characters in table names might be causing the bug.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output string from Hive commands without considering case sensitivity. Hive is case insensitive, so the table names returned may not match the original table names because of case differences.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of table names between the function input and the Hive output is case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparison, we can address the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table name comparison is case insensitive, as required by the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
