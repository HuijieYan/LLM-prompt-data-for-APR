To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` result should be case insensitive. The current implementation is case sensitive, leading to test failures when the case of the table name in `stdout` does not match the provided table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` result to lowercase before comparison, the function will be case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.

This correction should resolve the failing test cases and align with the expected behavior of the function according to the provided input/output values and the GitHub issue description.
