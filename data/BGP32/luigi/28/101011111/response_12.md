To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function and make it case insensitive, the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout should be done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the tables in stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function with case-insensitivity
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
                                  % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will be able to handle case-insensitive comparisons, as expected by the failing tests and the reported GitHub issue.
