The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name extracted from the Hive command output. The function is currently checking if the exact table name exists in the stdout, which causes issues with case differences.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout text to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction ensures that both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase for comparison, making the check case insensitive. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue raised regarding the case insensitivity of the `table_exists` function.

After applying this fix, the function will pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values mentioned in the analysis.
