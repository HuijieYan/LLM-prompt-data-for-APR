To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in GitHub. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
