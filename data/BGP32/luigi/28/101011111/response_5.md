After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, it is evident that the issue lies in the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from Hive. The table names retrieved from Hive are in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the names from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before the comparison, we can ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and the tests will pass as expected. This correction aligns with the GitHub issue raised (#896) and should resolve the case sensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function.
