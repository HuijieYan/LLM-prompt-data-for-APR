To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the database. We should modify the comparison to lowercase before verifying if the table exists in the retrieved stdout. This will ensure that we handle case sensitivity issues properly as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the test for table existence is case-insensitive, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.

This corrected version will now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values while resolving the GitHub issue regarding the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function.
