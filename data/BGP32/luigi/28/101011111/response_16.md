To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `stdout` and `table` strings to lowercase before comparing them. This will address the failing test cases where the table name is in a different case compared to what is returned in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before the comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue. This correction should ensure that the failing test cases related to case sensitivity are resolved.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases and the GitHub issues provided.
