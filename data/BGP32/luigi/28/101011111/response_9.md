To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the tables shown in the Hive output. Implementing a case-insensitive comparison will ensure that the function behaves correctly with different capitalization variations.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout is not None

```

In this corrected version:
- We ensure that the table name is compared in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the tables in the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.
- For the partitioned case, we only check if stdout is not None, as the specific partition being present in the output is not directly relevant to the existence of the table.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and behave correctly in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
