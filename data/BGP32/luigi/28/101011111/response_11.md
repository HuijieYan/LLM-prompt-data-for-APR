To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to avoid test failures due to different case variations.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function incorporating the necessary changes:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            # Change to compare in a case-insensitive manner
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table name in a case-insensitive way, allowing it to handle different case variations appropriately. This change should resolve the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues when checking table existence in Hive databases.
