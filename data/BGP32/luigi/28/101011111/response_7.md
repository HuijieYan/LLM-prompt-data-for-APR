The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the tests due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation of the function directly compares the table name without considering the case of the characters, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # No need for additional comparisons
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue for this bug, where the function should be case insensitive. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
