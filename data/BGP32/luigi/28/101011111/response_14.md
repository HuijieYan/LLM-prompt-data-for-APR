To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking if the table exists. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The key change in the corrected function is the conversion of both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change addresses the case sensitivity issue and ensures that the function behaves correctly.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in `table_exists`.
