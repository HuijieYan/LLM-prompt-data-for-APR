Based on the error messages and runtime values provided, it is evident that the bug is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function `table_exists` is comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failures in the test cases where the table names have different casing. 

To address this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. Additionally, we should ensure that the comparison is made on lowercase versions of both the table name and the output string from Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896. Once this correction is applied, the failing test cases should pass successfully.
