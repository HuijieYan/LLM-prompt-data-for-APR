After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is evident that the issue arises due to a case sensitivity problem in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the table exists in Hive by comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, but it does not consider case sensitivity. 

To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive, you should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the function can correctly identify the table irrespective of its case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command, making it case insensitive. This change should resolve the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub issue.
