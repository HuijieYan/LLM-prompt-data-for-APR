To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make sure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the command is case-insensitive. This will prevent test failures due to case mismatches. 

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before doing the comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
- By using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, we avoid failures due to case differences.

This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
