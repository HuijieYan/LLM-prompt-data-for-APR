To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout is case-insensitive. This involves converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to lowercase before the comparison, making it case-insensitive. This change aligns with the issue reported in the GitHub, where the behavior of the function should be insensitive to the case of the table names.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
