The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is not handling the case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function directly checks if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case of the table name. This leads to failing tests when the table name is in a different case than expected.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name `table` and the output `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive and the function will work correctly for tables with different case variations.

This correction should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values as listed. It also aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue #896.
