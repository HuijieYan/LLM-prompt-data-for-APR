To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout`. This will address the failing tests where the table names might be in different cases than expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive. This change addresses the failing test cases where the table names are in different cases than expected.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
