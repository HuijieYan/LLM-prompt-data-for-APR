The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name retrieved from `stdout` with the input table name. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the logic for handling the partitioned table check should be adjusted for correct evaluation.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive and matches the expected behavior.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the issue posted on GitHub about making `table_exists` case insensitive.
