The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the lowercase table name and the stdout output, which may not match due to the case sensitivity of the comparison. To address this issue, we need to modify the function to consider case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, we convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. This approach ensures that the function behaves consistently regardless of the case of the table name.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to making the table existence check case insensitive.
