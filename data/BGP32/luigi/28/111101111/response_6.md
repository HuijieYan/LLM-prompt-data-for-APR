Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue reported in GitHub, the failing test cases, the runtime variables, and the expected variables, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the `stdout` with the input table name. The function needs to be modified to be case insensitive for table existence checks.

To fix the bug, a comparison between the lowercased `table` name and the lowercased `stdout` should be performed instead of direct string comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this modification, the function will now perform case insensitive table existence checks against the table names in the Hive `stdout`. This change aligns with the suggested fix for the issue reported on GitHub and is expected to pass the failing test cases.
