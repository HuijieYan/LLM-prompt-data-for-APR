In the provided buggy function `table_exists`, the bug stems from the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should be case insensitive as well.

The bug causes test failures when checking table existence due to case sensitivity. The function does a direct string comparison between the table name and the output, leading to failures when the case doesn't match.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue reported on GitHub. The corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
