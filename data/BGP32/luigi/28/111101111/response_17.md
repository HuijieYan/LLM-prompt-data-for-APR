The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison between the table name and the tables returned by the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function needs to handle case-insensitive comparisons. 

To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the tables returned by the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and will match correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Importing the necessary module for lowercase conversion
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in re.split(r'\s+', stdout.lower())

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both the table name and the tables returned by the Hive command to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and fix the issue reported on GitHub.
