### Bug Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is comparing the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which might cause issues due to case sensitivity in table names.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly and is failing for tables with different casings than what is returned by `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The GitHub issue #896 also confirms the problem of case sensitivity and suggests a solution to make the comparison case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before comparison.
4. The function should be modified to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner to ensure the tests pass.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function ensures case insensitivity and should now pass the failing test cases.

This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue highlighted in the failing tests and the GitHub issue, providing a more robust and correct implementation of the `table_exists` function.
