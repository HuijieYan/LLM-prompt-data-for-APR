To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output case-insensitive. This will ensure that the function returns the correct result regardless of the casing used in the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the tables listed in the output, we address the issue described in the GitHub ticket. This change makes the comparison case-insensitive and ensures that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing tests mentioned, including the case-insensitive comparisons, as outlined in the specified expected values.
