### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that it directly checks if the `table` string is contained in the `stdout` string without considering case sensitivity. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this can lead to false negatives when comparing the table names.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison step where `table in stdout` is used without converting both strings to lowercase for a case-insensitive check.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the test cases to fail because the expected table name might have a different case than what is returned by Hive due to its case insensitivity. This results in the function returning incorrect values based on the case of the table names.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` string to lowercase before performing the comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive check and the function will return the correct results based on the table name.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will now correctly compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for case-insensitive comparisons.
