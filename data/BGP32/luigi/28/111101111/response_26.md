Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function currently checks if the exact table name exists in the stdout, which might fail due to case discrepancies between the input table name and the actual table name in Hive.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should modify the comparison to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables listed in the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the input table name and the tables listed in stdout to lowercase during comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and handle the case insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub thread.
