The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name with the content of `stdout`. The issue is that `table` and `stdout` are not being treated in a case-insensitive manner, causing the comparison to fail in certain scenarios where the case of the table name does not match that of the output from Hive.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both `table` and the content of `stdout` are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the table name case mismatch issue is resolved, addressing the concern raised in the GitHub issue.
