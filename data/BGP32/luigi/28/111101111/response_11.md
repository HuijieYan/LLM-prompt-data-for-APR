Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive.

This correction addresses the issue raised in GitHub related to case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function. It resolves the problem identified in the failing tests and aligns with the expected input/output values provided in the analysis.
