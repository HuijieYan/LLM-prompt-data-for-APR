Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, the main issue is the case sensitivity of the table comparison in the `table_exists` function. The function doesn't account for the case of the table name when comparing it to the stdout. This causes the tests to fail when the table name case doesn't match exactly.

To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is case insensitive. This change should make the function pass the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub.
