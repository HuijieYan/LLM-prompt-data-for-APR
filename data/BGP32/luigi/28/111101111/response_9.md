The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. The function does not handle case-insensitive table name comparison correctly, leading to failing test cases when the table names have different case variations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the `stdout` output, making the comparison case-insensitive. This fix will resolve the failing test cases where the table names have different cases.

This corrected version adheres to the expected input/output values, satisfies the failing tests, and addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
