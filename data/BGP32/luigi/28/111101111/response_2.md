To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` variable and the `stdout` string to lowercase before checking for table existence. This adjustment will address the reported issue on GitHub.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By incorporating the lowercase transformations for both `table` and `stdout` during the comparison, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitivity when checking for table existence. This adjustment aligns with the GitHub issue description and should make the `table_exists` function work as intended in the provided failing test cases.
