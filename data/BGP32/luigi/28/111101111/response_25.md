To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to adjust the comparison between the table name and the values in the `stdout` variable to be case insensitive. This will ensure that regardless of the casing of the table name, the function will correctly determine if the table exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase for comparison with the `stdout` variable that has also been converted to lowercase using `stdout.lower()`, making the comparison case insensitive.

This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub where the table names returned by Hive are in lowercase, causing the tests to fail due to case sensitivity.

This correction ensures that the function behaves as expected in all cases, including those outlined in the failing tests and the expected input/output values.
