### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands for the check.
2. The bug arises because the comparison between the table name and the stdout from the Hive command is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the table name case does not match with the stdout.
3. The failing test scenarios provide different cases where the table name and the returned stdout differ in case, causing failures in the equality check. The Github issue highlights the need to make the comparison case-insensitive to resolve this problem.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that handles case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check and pass the failing tests.
