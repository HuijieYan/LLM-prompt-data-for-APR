The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking if the table exists in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function compares the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to failing tests due to case sensitivity issues.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change makes the function case insensitive, resolving the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues.
