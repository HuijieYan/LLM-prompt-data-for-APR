The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that it does a case-sensitive check between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which leads to test failures. The issue on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to avoid these problems.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, resolving the issue and allowing the function to pass the failing tests.
