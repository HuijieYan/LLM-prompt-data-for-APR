### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it is not handling the case insensitivity of table names correctly. The function is checking for an exact match of the table name in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which leads to failures when the case of the table name doesn't match the case of the output from Hive.

The GitHub issue mentions that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence to accommodate scenarios where table names are defined with different capitalization styles.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the cases don't match.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will be able to handle case insensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases.
