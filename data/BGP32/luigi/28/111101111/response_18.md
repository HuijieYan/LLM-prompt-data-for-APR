The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from the Hive command output with the actual table name passed into the function. This causes the tests to fail due to the mismatch in case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table names to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name from the function input and the table name extracted from the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name from the input and the one from the command output to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and making the function pass the failing tests.
