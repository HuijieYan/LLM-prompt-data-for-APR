## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. This leads to issues when the table name is stored in uppercase or mixed case in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive to handle these situations.

## Error Location:
The buggy function does not convert the table name to lowercase when comparing it with the output from Hive, leading to case sensitivity issues.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not handling case sensitivity when comparing the expected table name with the output from the Hive show tables command (stdout).

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive show tables command. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue described in the GitHub reports.
