### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists()` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that tables defined with different case sensitivity may cause the function to fail.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the stdout is case sensitive.
2. The function should compare lowercased versions of the table name and the stdout.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug exists because the function directly compares the original table name with the stdout, which may not match due to case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives and incorrect behavior when checking for table existence, especially when the table name is defined in a different case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison should be made case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version converts both the table name and the stdout to lower case using the `lower()` function before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database. Additionally, the return statement has been simplified to directly return the result of the comparison.

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle different cases of table names without leading to false negatives.
