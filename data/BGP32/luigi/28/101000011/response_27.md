### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that table names in Hive can be case-sensitive, causing the function's current implementation to fail.
3. The bug occurs because the function directly checks if the table name exists in the output from the Hive command, which may not match due to case sensitivity.
4. The suggested fix involves converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Proposed Fix:
To address the issue of case sensitivity, modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking if the table exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version converts both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
