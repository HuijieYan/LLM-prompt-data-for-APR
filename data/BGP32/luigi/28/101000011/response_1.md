### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in Hive using a given table name and database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
2. The bug arises from comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive, which may not match due to case sensitivity.
3. The bug is due to inconsistent case handling when comparing the table name in the function with the table names retrieved from Hive. This causes failures when the case does not match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names to be case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the function `table_exists` to convert both the table name and the retrieved table names from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
2. Adjust the comparison logic to check if the lowercase table name is in the lowercase output from Hive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this modification, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
