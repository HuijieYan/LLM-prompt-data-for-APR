## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue where it does case-sensitive comparison when checking for table existence in Hive. The GitHub issue indicates that tables defined with different cases (capitalized vs. lower case) can lead to test failures due to case sensitivity.

## Identified Issue:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive. It directly compares the table name with the stdout from Hive without considering the case sensitivity.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the lack of case insensitivity handling in the `table_exists` function. Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names, but the function is not considering that, leading to test failures when comparing tables with different cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This way, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison and avoid test failures due to case differences.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`.
2. Used `bool(stdout)` instead of separate return statements to return True if `stdout` is not empty.
3. The bug fix makes the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the issue highlighted in the GitHub comments.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons, resolving the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue.
