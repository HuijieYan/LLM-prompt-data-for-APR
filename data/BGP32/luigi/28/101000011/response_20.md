### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue reported in GitHub highlights that tables with different case variations could lead to false negative results when checking for table existence.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name in the `stdout` with the provided table name in the `table_exists` function.
2. The handling of case sensitivity in the condition statements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the direct comparison of the provided table name with the table names retrieved from Hive tables. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table names can vary in cases, leading to mismatches in the comparison.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to ensure that both the table name provided and the table names retrieved from Hive are in the same case for comparison. Transforming both to lower case before comparison would resolve the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the provided `table` name and the names retrieved from Hive are converted to lower case before comparison using `lower()`. This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub.
