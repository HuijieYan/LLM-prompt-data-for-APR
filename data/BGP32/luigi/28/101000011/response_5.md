### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not checking for case sensitivity when comparing table names.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem where tables defined with capitalized names are returned as lower case by Hive, causing test failures.
- The suggested solution in the GitHub issue is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This can lead to false negatives when checking for table existence due to case mismatches.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive. Convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue. This fix ensures that the `table_exists` function can correctly identify tables regardless of case differences.
