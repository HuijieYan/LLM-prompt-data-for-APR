### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database, but it is case sensitive.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that table names can be returned in lowercase regardless of their actual case in the database, causing the test to fail.
3. The bug causes incorrect results when checking for table existence due to the case sensitivity of comparing table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparison to make the check case-insensitive.
2. This change aligns with the suggestion provided in the GitHub issue to avoid case issues while checking the existence of a table in Hive.
3. By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function will correctly identify whether a table exists regardless of the casing of the table name returned by Hive.
