### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists()` is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd()` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
- The bug mentioned in the GitHub issue indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence due to Hive being case insensitive.
- The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive, which can be in lowercase regardless of the case of the provided table name.
- The suggested fix is to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists()` function to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Make comparison case insensitive
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are treated in a case insensitive manner, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
