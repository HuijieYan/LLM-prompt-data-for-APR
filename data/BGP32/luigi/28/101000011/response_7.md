### Potential error locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the stdout may not handle case sensitivity correctly.
2. The `table_exists` function may not be considering the case insensitivity of Hive.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of the table name and the stdout retrieved from Hive not considering case sensitivity. Hive is case insensitive, so comparing the table name directly may lead to incorrect results if the cases do not match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout retrieved from Hive is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity. This modification aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should address the problem.
