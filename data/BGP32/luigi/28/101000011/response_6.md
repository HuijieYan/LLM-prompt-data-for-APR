## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue raised on GitHub highlights that tables defined with capitalized names may fail the check since Hive returns table names in lowercase. The current implementation does a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity.

## Error Locations:
- The `table_exists` function does a direct comparison of the table name without converting it to lowercase for a case-insensitive check.
- The `stdout` value returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function might have a different case for table names.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity, which leads to table name mismatches when comparing user-defined table names with Hive returned table names.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the user-defined table name with the table names returned by Hive.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Simplified the return statement
    
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the user-defined table name and the Hive returned table name to lowercase for comparison, making it case-insensitive.
- Simplified the handling of the return statement for clarity and consistency.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will be case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
