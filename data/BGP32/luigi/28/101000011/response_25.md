### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue reported in GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for the table existence due to discrepancies in case sensitivity between table names in code and their representation in Hive.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison in the `table_exists` function between `table` and `stdout` does not consider case insensitivity, potentially leading to bugs when the case differs between the table name in code and the actual table name in Hive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the direct equality check between the table name provided and the output from Hive, which may not match when the table names have different cases. Hive is case-insensitive, causing the discrepancy in behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison. This way, we can perform a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output from Hive are converted to lowercase before the comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the Hive database.
