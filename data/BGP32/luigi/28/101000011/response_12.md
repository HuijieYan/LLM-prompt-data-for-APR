### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within `luigi/contrib/hive.py` checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The related GitHub issue highlights the problem that the function is case sensitive, leading to failures when table names are in different cases due to Hive's case insensitivity. The proposed solution is to modify the function to be case insensitive by comparing the table name in lowercase with the output in lowercase.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
The bug arises from the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. The function compares `table` directly with `stdout`, leading to case-related failures.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` comparing table names in their original case with the output from Hive, which may differ due to case insensitivity. This causes the function to incorrectly determine table existence, leading to failures in certain scenarios.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive needs to be made case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation of Changes
The corrected version of the function `table_exists` now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub reports. Now, `table_exists` should work correctly regardless of the case of the table name in the Hive database.
