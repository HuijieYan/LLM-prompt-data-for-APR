In the provided buggy function `table_exists`, the comparison of the table name is case-sensitive, which causes issues when checking for table existence in Hive as Hive is case-insensitive. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` should be replaced with `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to make the comparison case-insensitive.
2. The same correction should be applied to the `self.partition_spec(partition)` comparison in the else block.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the assumption that the table names are case-sensitive when checking for their existence in Hive. This assumption leads to failures when the actual table name in Hive is returned in lowercase format due to Hive's case-insensitivity.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the comparisons to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved names to lowercase for comparison. This change ensures that the function can correctly identify a table's existence in Hive regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing the corrected version provided above, the function `table_exists` will now handle the comparison properly by making it case-insensitive, in line with the intended behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
