### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a given table exists in the database. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence due to Hive being case insensitive.
- The bug arises because the comparison in the buggy function does not consider case sensitivity, causing failures when the table names have different cases.
- The suggestion provided in the GitHub issue recommends using `table.lower()` for comparison to avoid case issues.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because it directly compares the given table name with the tables returned by the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting the table names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` are used for comparison to make the check case insensitive. This change addresses the reported issue and ensures that the function behaves correctly as desired.
