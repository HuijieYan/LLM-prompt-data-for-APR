### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is not handling case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this problem. If a table is defined with capitalized letters but Hive returns the table name in lowercase, the function will fail to detect the table.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison between the table name provided and the table name retrieved from the Hive output without considering case sensitivity.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout from Hive is done after converting both to lowercase.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing in the `if` condition to check table existence.
- We simplify the return statement for the partitioned case to directly return whether `stdout` has content.

This corrected version will address the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
