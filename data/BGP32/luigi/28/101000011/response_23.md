### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
- The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be modified to be case insensitive by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the tables in the Hive metadata.
- The existing implementation does not consider case sensitivity, leading to potential false negatives when checking for table existence.

### Potential Error Location:
- The bug is likely in the comparison between the table name and the tables fetched from the Hive metadata in the `table_exists` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive is case sensitive. In Hive, table names are case insensitive, leading to mismatches between the expected table name and the actual table names returned by Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and the tables from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison and avoid false negatives.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Correction Explanation:
- In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the tables retrieved from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- This modification ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub ticket.
