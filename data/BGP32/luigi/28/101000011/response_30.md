### Analyzing the buggy function and related functions:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database. Depending on whether a partition is specified or not, it uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to retrieve information and then checks if the table exists based on the stdout output.

The related function `run_hive_cmd` is used to execute Hive commands and return the output for further processing.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison between the table name and the output from Hive may not work as expected due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The conditional check for `stdout` may not accurately determine the existence of the table in certain scenarios.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises due to the case sensitivity of the table names in Hive. If the table names are not consistently formatted (e.g., capitalized or lowercase), the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive may lead to false negatives. This inconsistency wasn't a problem in older versions where a simpler string check was used.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should compare the lowercase versions of both the table name and the output from Hive. This adjustment will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase before the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This modification aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue and addresses the case sensitivity issue reported.
