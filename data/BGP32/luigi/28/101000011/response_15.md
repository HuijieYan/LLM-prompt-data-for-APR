### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is performing checks on table existence in a case-sensitive manner. This behavior has been flagged as an issue in GitHub, indicating that the function should be case-insensitive to match the behavior of Hive.

### Error Locations:
1. In the comparison `table in stdout`, which is case-sensitive.
2. In the comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, which should be implemented to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the comparison being made between the `table` name and the result from Hive `stdout` is case-sensitive. Hive is case-insensitive, so the function should account for this to accurately check for table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparisons should be changed to a case-insensitive comparison by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons, resolving the issue raised on GitHub and aligning the function with the expected behavior of Hive regarding table existence checks.
