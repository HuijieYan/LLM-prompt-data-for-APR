The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function currently compares the table name directly without considering case differences, leading to failures when tables are defined with different capitalization.

To fix this bug, we should modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive (`stdout`) to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This modification ensures that the table name and the output from Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue outlined in the GitHub thread about case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
