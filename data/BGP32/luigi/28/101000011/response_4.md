## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. It doesn't take into account the case of the table name when comparing it to the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which leads to inconsistencies due to case sensitivity in Hive.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly compares the given `table` name to the output `stdout` without considering the case of the names. This may lead to false negatives if the case doesn't match between the input table name and the actual table names in Hive.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is due to Hive being case insensitive while Python's string comparison is case sensitive. When the `stdout` is retrieved from Hive, it may contain table names in lowercase, while the `table` parameter is provided in a different case format. This mismatch causes the comparison to fail, even though the table actually exists.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the input `table` name and the table names in `stdout` is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This approach aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the table names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
