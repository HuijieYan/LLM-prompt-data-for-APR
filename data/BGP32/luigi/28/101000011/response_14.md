Potential error locations in the buggy function:
- The comparison between the table name and the table names in the stdout is case sensitive, causing the check to fail if there is a case difference.

Cause of the bug:
- The function `table_exists` does a direct string comparison between the table name and the names returned by the Hive command. Since Hive is case insensitive, if the case of the table name in the code does not match the case of the table in Hive, the comparison fails.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the names in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the names from the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
