### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is `table_exists`. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, where the table names are returned in lowercase even if they are queried with mixed case or uppercase names.

### Potential Error Locations

The potential error in the `table_exists` function lies in how it compares the table name passed to it with the list of tables returned by the Hive command. The comparison does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, which is in lowercase. This leads to incorrect results when checking for the existence of tables with mixed case or uppercase names.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison operation in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the name returned by the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, before comparing the table name with the list of tables returned by Hive, we convert both to lowercase using `.lower()` method to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
