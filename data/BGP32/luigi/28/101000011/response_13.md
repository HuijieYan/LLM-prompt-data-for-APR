### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug identified in the GitHub issue is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name returned by Hive with the provided table name in `table_exists` function. The function currently does a direct comparison which can lead to case-related failures.

### Error Location:
The error is likely to occur in the comparison step where `table in stdout` is used, or alternatively in `return stdout and table in stdout`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a case sensitivity issue when comparing table names in the `table_exists` function. Hive is case insensitive when returning table names, but the function `table_exists` does a direct comparison without handling the case sensitivity.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the table returned by Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. Both the table name `table` and the table name returned by Hive in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison to make it case insensitive.
2. The function returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, indicating that the table exists, and returns `False` otherwise.

By making the comparison case insensitive, we have addressed the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
