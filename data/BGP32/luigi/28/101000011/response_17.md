### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is not performing case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This leads to issues where tables defined with different cases might fail the existence check due to case mismatch.

### Identified Potential Error:
The potential error in the buggy function lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` output without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `table_exists` function directly comparing the provided `table` string with the `stdout` obtained from Hive commands without converting both to a common case format to perform a case-insensitive check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, the comparison should be done after converting both the `table` and the `stdout` string to lowercase. By doing this, the function will be able to correctly identify the existence of a table irrespective of the case format.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` strings are converted to lowercase before doing the comparison. This modification ensures that the function can correctly identify the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner.
