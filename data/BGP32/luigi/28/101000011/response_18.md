### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive to handle cases where table names are provided in different casing.
2. The current implementation of the `table_exists` function only checks if the exact table name exists in the output from the Hive command, leading to failures when comparing table names in different casings.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from not considering case sensitivity when comparing the input table name with the output from the Hive command.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the input table name and the output from the Hive command should be case insensitive. One way to do this is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, both the input table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the function is now case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database.
