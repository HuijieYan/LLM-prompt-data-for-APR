The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity problem where the table name comparison is not done in a case-insensitive manner. This leads to failures when comparing table names that may have different cases.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive should be done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lower case before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lower case before checking for inclusion. This will prevent the issues related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
