### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a database using Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` value after running the Hive commands. In the first `if` branch, it checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, while in the second `if` branch, it only checks if `stdout` exists.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` value. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the function to return `False` even if the table name exists with a different case in the database.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
#The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

#The corrected buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```


In the corrected version, I added `lower()` method to both `table` and `stdout` to make the comparison case-insensitive, returning `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not.
