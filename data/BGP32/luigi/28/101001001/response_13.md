### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. In the case where a partition is specified, it also calls the `partition_spec` function to construct the partition specification string.

The bug in the function lies in the comparison `table in stdout`. This comparison checks if the table name exists in the output of the `show tables` or `show partitions` commands. However, the bug arises because the table name comparison is case-sensitive, and the returned table names might not match the case of the input table name, leading to false negatives.

### Bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function is a case-sensitive comparison when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table names without considering their case, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to perform a case-insensitive check of the table names in the output. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the names in the output to the same case (e.g., lower case) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, the comparison `table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())` is used to perform a case-insensitive check for the table existence. It converts both the input table name and names in the output to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a proper match regardless of case.
