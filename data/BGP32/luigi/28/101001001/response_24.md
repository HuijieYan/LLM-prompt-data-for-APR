### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check whether a table exists in a database. It makes a Hive command call to check for the table's existence based on the provided parameters. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the output of the Hive command.

### Bug
The bug in the function occurs in the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command. The function checks if the `table` variable is in the `stdout`, which may lead to incorrect results due to potential case sensitivity issues.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case-insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function should now correctly find the table even if there are case differences.
