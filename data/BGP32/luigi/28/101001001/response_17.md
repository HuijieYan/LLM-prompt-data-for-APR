### Analysis
The `table_exists` function is designed to check whether a table exists in a given database with or without a specified partition. In the provided cases, the function seems to incorrectly check for the presence of the table in the stdout output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which might lead to incorrect results. The comparison `table in stdout` does not ensure accurate table existence checks due to potential inconsistencies in the format of the stdout output.

### Bug
The bug lies in how the function checks for the table's existence in the stdout output. The comparison `table in stdout` is not reliable as it may produce false positives or negatives due to variations in the format and content of the output.

### Fix
To fix the bug, modify the function to check the presence of the table name in the stdout output by properly parsing the output. One way to achieve this is to split the stdout content by newline characters and then check each line for the exact table name. This approach ensures that the function accurately determines the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        return False
``` 

By splitting the stdout content and checking each line against the exact table name, the corrected function ensures a more accurate table existence check.
