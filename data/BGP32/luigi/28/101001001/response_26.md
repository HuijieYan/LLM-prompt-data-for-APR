### Analysis:
The `table_exists` function checks for the existence of a table in a specific database in Hive. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is in the logic used to determine if the table exists. The function is currently checking if the table name is in the entirety of the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can lead to incorrect results if the table name appears as part of another word in the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify how we check for the table name in the stdout. Instead of checking if the table name is in the full output string, we should split the output by lines and then check if the table name appears in any of the lines individually. This way, we ensure that we are checking the exact table name only.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the output by lines and comparing the table name with each line individually, we fix the bug and ensure a more accurate check for the table existence.
