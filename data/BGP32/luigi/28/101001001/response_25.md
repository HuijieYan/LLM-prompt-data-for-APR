### The Bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the function is checking for the existence of a table in Hive. In the first case, the function checks if the table name is present in the output of the `show tables` command. However, this check is simplistic and can lead to incorrect results. In the second case, the function checks if the table name is present in the output which contains both the table name and other information, potentially leading to a false positive. This leads to inconsistencies in the function's behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should perform a more robust check to ensure that it accurately determines the existence of a table in Hive. One way to improve this is by splitting the output of the `show tables` command and checking only for the table name in the list. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the table name might be present in a different context in the output. 

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
    
        return any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version splits the output of `show tables` into a list of tables and then checks if the given table name exists in this list. It also accounts for case insensitivity by converting both the provided table name and the table names in the list to lowercase for comparison.
