### Analysis
The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition specification. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the case where a partition is specified.

### Bug
In the else block of the `table_exists` function, the stdout variable is checked for truthiness to determine if the table exists. However, in the case where a partition is specified, stdout is used to store the output of a command that lists partitions based on the table and partition specification. Regardless of the existence of the table, the presence of partitions will cause the stdout to be non-empty and therefore always return True. This is not the expected behavior.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the else block so that it correctly checks for the table's existence rather than just the presence of partitions. We can achieve this by modifying the condition in the if statement to check if the table is present in the stdout output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partitions_stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        table_exists_stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table_exists_stdout and table in table_exists_stdout and partitions_stdout
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we first check for the existence of the table without partitions. When a partition is specified, we additionally check if the table exists in the stdout where partitions are listed. This approach ensures that the function correctly detects the table's existence in both cases.
