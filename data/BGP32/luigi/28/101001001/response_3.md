### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. In the case where a partition is provided, the function also calls `partition_spec` to build the partition specification for the table.

The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function checks if the table name is directly in the output, which can lead to incorrect results if the table name is a substring of another table's name.

### Bug
The bug lies in the comparison of the table name with the output when checking for table existence. The function checks if the table name exactly matches a table in the output, leading to potential false negatives and incorrect results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to check if the table name is present in the output as a separate entity, not part of another table's name.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The table existence check now splits the output by lines and compares each table name individually, ignoring case differences.
- The function always returns a boolean value based on whether stdout contains tables or partitions.

This correction should resolve the bug and improve the accuracy of the table existence check.
