### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. In the first part of the function, if the `partition` parameter is `None`, it constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table. In the second part, if a `partition` is provided, it constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of a specific partition of the table.

The bug seems to be in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. Since the `stdout` variable may contain other information in addition to the table name (like 'OK' in Case 1), directly checking `table in stdout` might lead to incorrect results.

### Bug
The bug is due to the way the `stdout` variable is checked for table existence. The current implementation simply checks if the table name exists as a substring in the `stdout` variable, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the `stdout` variable to extract the table names before performing the comparison. One way to do this is by splitting the `stdout` variable on newlines, then checking each line for the table name.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` variable by newline characters and iterate over each line to check if the `table` exists in any of the lines. This approach ensures accurate table existence checks.
