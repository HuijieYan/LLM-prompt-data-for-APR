### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The function utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and obtain the output stored in `stdout`. 

In the provided cases, the function is checking for the existence of a table by running specific Hive commands. However, the condition checking the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable is incorrect. It only checks if the table name is in the `stdout` string, which can lead to false positives or negatives due to the presence of other information in the `stdout`.

### Bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it checks for the existence of the table in the output obtained from running the Hive commands. The current condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not sufficient to accurately verify the existence of the table.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to ensure that we are specifically checking for the table name in the output. We can split the `stdout` by newlines, strip any whitespace, and then check if the table name is in the list of tables obtained from the Hive command.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
    
            return stdout and table in [t.strip() for t in stdout.split('\n')]
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This updated version splits the output `stdout` by newlines, strips any whitespace, and then checks if the table name is in the list of tables obtained, thus providing a more accurate check for table existence.
