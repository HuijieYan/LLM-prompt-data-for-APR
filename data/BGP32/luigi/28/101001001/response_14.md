### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database in Hive. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The issue seems to be with how the function is checking for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug
The bug arises from the way the function is checking the presence of the table name in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`. The function checks if the string `table` is present in the output `stdout`, which leads to incorrect results due to case sensitivity.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case sensitivity issue. One way to address this is by converting the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output are compared in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug in the function.
