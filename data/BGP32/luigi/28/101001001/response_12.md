## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way the function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. 

In the first part of the function where `partition` parameter is None, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists in the specified database. However, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is flawed because it will return True if `stdout` is not empty and the table name is anywhere within the `stdout` string. This can lead to false positives if another table has a similar name as a substring in `stdout`.

In the second part of the function where `partition` parameter is not None, the function constructs a Hive command to check for the existence of a specific partition of the table. Here, the function checks `if stdout:` which means it will return True as long as `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the specific partition actually exists.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for the existence of the table and its partition. Instead of relying on substring checks within the `stdout` string, we should validate the output more precisely to ensure that the table or partition exists. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        return any(p.strip() == self.partition_spec(partition) for p in stdout.splitlines())
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` string into lines and check if the table or partition matches exactly with one of the lines returned by the Hive command. This approach ensures a more accurate determination of the table or partition existence in the Hive database.
