### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` in the first part of the `if` statement may not be handling the output correctly.
2. The string comparison may have issues in checking whether the table name is in the output string.
3. The formatting in the second part of the if statement where `run_hive_cmd` is called may not be correct.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It does this by running a Hive command and then checking if the table name is present in the output of that command.
2. In Case 1, the output `stdout` is `'OK'` which means the table `mytable` does not exist. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrectly handling this scenario as `'OK' in stdout` would evaluate to true, leading to a false positive.
3. In Case 2, the output `stdout` is `'OK\nmytable'` which should indicate that the table `mytable` exists. However, the current comparison method may not be accurate for all scenarios.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the condition checking to properly handle the output and table name comparison.
2. Review the string comparison method to ensure it accurately identifies the presence of the table name in the output.
3. Verify the formatting of the Hive command in the second part of the `if` statement to ensure correct execution.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Fix to properly check if table name is in the stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Simplifying the return statement to handle True/False cases correctly
``` 

By implementing the suggested changes and checking the presence of the table name in the split stdout output, the function will be able to accurately determine if a table exists in the Hive database.
