### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the inconsistency in checking the presence of the table name in the `stdout`. The function currently checks if the table name is present as a whole in `stdout`, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function does not properly check if the table name is present in the list of tables in the `stdout`. It merely checks if the entire table name exists in the `stdout`, which can lead to false negatives in certain cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the table name is present as a separate entity in the list of tables in the `stdout`. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` based on newline characters and then checking each line for the presence of the table name.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split("\n")
        
        return any(table == t for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        partitions = stdout.split("\n")
        
        return any(table == p.split("=")[0] for p in partitions)
```

### Updated Test Case:
Since the function is being tested through a test class, the test cases should remain the same. However, with the corrected function, the failing test cases should now pass without triggering an AssertionError.
