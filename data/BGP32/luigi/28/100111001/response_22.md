### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks if the `table` is present in the `stdout` output. The function incorrectly returns `True` only if the table is found in the first line of the `stdout` output. This behavior causes the function to fail the test cases where additional content is included in the `stdout` output after the table name.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the `table` exists in any line of the `stdout`, not just the first line. We can achieve this by splitting the `stdout` by newlines and checking for the presence of the `table` in each line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))  # Check if table exists in any line
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
``` 

By making this change, the function will properly check if the specified `table` exists in the output regardless of the position in the `stdout`, fixing the bug.
