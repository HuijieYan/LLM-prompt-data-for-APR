The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the check of the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the table is present in the `stdout` string by using the `in` operator, but this leads to false positives as it might match partial table names.

To fix the bug, a more precise check is needed. One approach is to split the `stdout` string by lines and check if any line exactly matches the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by lines and checks if the exact table name is present in one of the lines. This approach ensures a more accurate check for the table's existence.

After implementing this fix, the failing test cases should pass without any AssertionError.
