The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks if the `table` exists in the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is checking if the `table` string directly matches the output string, which is insufficient for cases where the table name appears within a newline separated list of tables.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly parse the output and check if the `table` name is present in the list of tables obtained from the command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None
```

In this corrected version:
1. We fetch all tables using `show tables` instead of specifically looking for the input table name.
2. We split the stdout by newline characters and check if the `table` is in the list obtained.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly identify the existence of a table in the Hive database, and the failing test should pass.
