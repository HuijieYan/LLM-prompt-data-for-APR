### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table or partition exists in the specified database by running Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the function processes the `stdout` output of the Hive commands.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not correctly handling the `stdout` response from the Hive commands.
4. The function expects either the table name or partition details to be present in the `stdout` output to determine existence. However, the implementation is not correctly parsing and checking the output.
5. For the failing test cases, the function is returning incorrect values based on the `stdout` response, leading to test failures.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the function incorrectly checks the presence of the table or partition details in the `stdout` without proper parsing. This causes the function to return incorrect values based on the `stdout` content.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the `stdout` response and determine if the table or partition exists. We need to ensure that the function accurately checks for the presence of the table or partition details in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return len(stdout.strip()) > 0
```

By splitting the `stdout` content and checking for the presence of the table name properly, the corrected function should now return the correct values to pass the failing test cases.
