The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database based on the provided parameters. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the table existence status based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Based on the failing tests and the runtime values and types of variables provided, we can identify the following potential issues:
1. In the first case, when "mytable" exists, the function should return `True`, but the comparison `table in stdout` is not handling the newline character properly.
2. In the second and fourth cases, the issue is also related to the newline character not being correctly handled when checking if the table exists in the stdout.
3. The function is not considering the case sensitivity of table names, leading to the failure in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the newline character properly and ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With these modifications, the function should now handle the newline character correctly and perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking the existence of the table. This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
