### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison logic in the `if` statement. When checking if the `stdout` contains the table name, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` might not work as intended. This condition may return `True` even if `table` is not present in `stdout` in some cases due to the way the `and` operator works. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases where the table name is not found in the output giving false positives.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` variable. We should explicitly check if the `table` is present in the `stdout` string by splitting it into lines and then comparing each line with the `table` name. This approach ensures that we accurately determine if the table exists based on the output from the Hive command.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            if table in tables:
                return True
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` string into lines and then checking if the `table` name exists in those lines, we ensure a more reliable way to determine the existence of the table in the Hive output. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
