### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of the table within the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` command. The function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists in the output and `False` otherwise. However, the bug causes the function to return the opposite result.

### Bug Explanation
When the function receives the output from the `run_hive_cmd` command, it checks if the table name is in the output. If it is, the function should return `True`, indicating that the table exists. However, due to a logical error, the function returns `False` when the table is found in the output and `True` when the table is not found. This mismatch causes the failing test cases to assert the incorrect value, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logical error in the `table_exists` function. We should return `True` when the table is found in the output and `False` when it is not found. By correcting this condition, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout  # Return True if stdout is not empty, indicating the table exists
```

By making this correction, the function will now correctly return `True` when the table is found in the output and `False` when it is not found, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass successfully.
