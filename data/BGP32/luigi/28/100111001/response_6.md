The bug in the function `table_exists` is that it is returning the opposite boolean value than expected in the cases where the table exists. The function is returning `False` when it should return `True` and vice versa.

The bug is likely happening due to the conditions checking the `stdout` variable and returning `True` or `False` based on that. The issue seems to be that the condition is not correctly evaluating the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checking for the table name in the `stdout` variable. Instead of just checking if `stdout` is not empty, we should inspect the contents of `stdout` to see if the table name is present in it.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable on whitespace and checking if the table name is in the resulting list, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table.

This correction should make the function pass the failing tests provided.
