The issue in the buggy function is with the condition checking for the existence of a table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is not properly handling the case where the table name might appear in a new line in the output. This causes the function to incorrectly return `False` even when the table exists in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the table existence check to handle cases where the table name appears in a new line in the output. One way to do this is to split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any of the elements after the split.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        tables_list = stdout.split()
        return any(table in t for t in tables_list)
        
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string and checking each element, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
