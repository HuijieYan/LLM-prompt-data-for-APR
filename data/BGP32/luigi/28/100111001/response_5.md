The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to lie in the comparison logic when checking if the table exists in the Hive output. The function is currently returning the result of the comparison between the table name and the full output string, which is causing the test failures.

The bug occurs because the function checks for an exact match of the table name within the stdout, but the comparison should be case-insensitive and should consider whether the table name exists as a separate line in the stdout.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the function. Instead of checking for an exact match, we should check if the table name is present as a separate line in the stdout, regardless of the case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the lines in stdout to lowercase for comparison. This change ensures a case-insensitive match and checks if the table name exists as a separate line in the output.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test cases should pass without any issues.
