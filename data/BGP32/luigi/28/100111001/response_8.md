### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table with optional partition exists in a given database. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists.

In Case 1 and Case 3, the function returns `True` when it should return `False`. This is due to the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, where `stdout` is the response from the hive command and `table` is the name of the table. The condition doesn't properly check if the table is present in the stdout response.

In Case 2 and Case 4, the function fails to return `True` when it should. This is because the stdout response may contain multiple lines, and the function only checks if the table name is directly in the stdout string.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the comparison operation `return stdout and table in stdout`. The function incorrectly checks if the table name is directly in the stdout string without considering the multi-line output that may contain table names. This causes incorrect evaluation of table existence.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function validates the existence of the table. By splitting the stdout response into lines and checking if the table name is present in any of those lines, we can ensure the correct identification of table existence.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

By using `bool(stdout.strip())`, we can check if there are any non-whitespace characters in the stdout response, indicating the presence of the table or partition information.

This updated function should pass the failing test cases and correctly determine the existence of tables in the Hive database.
