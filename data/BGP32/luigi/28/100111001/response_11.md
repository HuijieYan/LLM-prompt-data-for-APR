The issue in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not, based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

After analyzing the provided buggy function, failing test cases, error messages, and runtime input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in how the function handles the condition to return `True` when the table is found in the stdout output.

The bug fix involves properly parsing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table is present in the Hive database. In the current implementation, the function directly checks if the table name is in the output string, which can lead to incorrect results due to potential mismatched table names.

To fix the bug, we should split the stdout output by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the list of table names extracted from the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        if stdout:
            table_names = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in table_names
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            (%s)""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version properly splits the stdout output by newline characters and then checks if the table name exists in the list of table names. This should address the buggy behavior identified in the failing test cases.
