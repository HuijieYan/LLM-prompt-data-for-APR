### Analysis
- The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a database using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The bug seems to be in the comparison logic for checking if the table exists in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- The function is returning `True` when it should have actually returned `False` and vice versa.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the function's return statement. Instead of checking if the table is in the stdout, it is checking if the stdout object is non-empty.

### Fix Strategy
- Update the function logic to correctly check if the table exists in the stdout by comparing the `table` variable directly with the lines in the stdout.
- Utilize the `splitlines()` method to split the stdout into individual lines for easier comparison.
- Update the return statements to reflect the correct outcome based on the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly identify whether the table exists in the given database and return the appropriate boolean value based on the comparison. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
