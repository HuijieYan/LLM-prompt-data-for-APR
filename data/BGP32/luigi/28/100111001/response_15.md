The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout`. The function returns `True` only if the table name is found directly in the `stdout`. However, in some cases, the table name is preceded or followed by other characters (like newline characters) in the `stdout`, causing the check to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to account for these additional characters around the table name in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on whitespace characters, we ensure that we are checking for the table name in each separate part of the returned output. This modification should address the issue and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
