### Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
- The buggy function has two branches, one for checking table existence without partition and one for checking with partition.
- The failing tests indicate issues with the function not correctly identifying table existence in both cases.
- The issue seems to be with how the function checks the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine table existence.
- In the failing tests, the function fails to recognize the table existence due to incorrect parsing of the output.

### Bug
The bug in the function arises from the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` where the presence of `table` in `stdout` does not guarantee that the table exists. This condition will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty and contains the `table` string anywhere. This results in false-positive table existence.

Similarly, in the case with partitions, the function incorrectly checks if `stdout` is non-empty to determine table existence, leading to false positives.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks the output of `run_hive_cmd`. We should explicitly check for the exact existence of the table or partition in the `stdout` string.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_filter = ",".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_filter))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` string by newline and checking exact table existence for non-partitioned tables and directly returning the boolean value for partitioned tables, we ensure accurate table existence checks.
