### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database with optional partition information. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute commands.
2. The issue arises from how the function processes the output from `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table exists. The function expects the table name in the output to validate its existence.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the table name is part of a larger string in the output. It only checks if the table name is present as a substring, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure an exact match of the table name in the output.
5. The corrected version of the function will correctly verify the existence of tables in Hive, taking into account different scenarios.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            # Check if the table exists in the stdout
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            # Check if the table exists in the partitions
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By splitting the lines in the `stdout` variable and checking each line for an exact match with the table name, we ensure accurate validation of table existence.
