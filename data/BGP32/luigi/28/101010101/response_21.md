### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
2. The function has an issue in handling the output from `run_hive_cmd` and determining if the table exists based on that output.
3. The failing tests indicate that the function fails to correctly identify the existence of the table.
4. The bug is likely related to how the function processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function and checks for the table name in it.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to properly parse the stdout to check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.

### Correction:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower().splitlines()

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(table.lower() in line.lower() for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

Now, the corrected function should properly check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner and correctly parse the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This correction should address the failing tests and satisfy all expected input/output values.
