### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command, but it has a bug where it fails to correctly parse the output of the Hive command to determine the existence of the table.
2. The bug occurs when the function checks for the presence of a table based on the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It incorrectly checks if the table name is present in the output, leading to incorrect results.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing tests that expect the table to exist but are reported as non-existent.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function parses the stdout correctly and handles the cases where the table name may be part of a line or separated by other characters in the output.
5. We need to modify the logic of checking the table name in the stdout and handle cases where the table name might be present in multiple lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and any(line.strip().lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. In the corrected version, the function now splits the stdout by newline characters and checks if any line, when stripped of leading/trailing spaces and converted to lowercase, matches the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This ensures that we correctly identify the table name in the output.
2. For the partitioned table case, the function simply checks if stdout is not empty, which indicates that the table exists.
3. By making these modifications, the function now correctly handles the parsing of Hive command output and accurately determines the existence of a table, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
