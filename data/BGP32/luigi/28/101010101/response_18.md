### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it is not correctly parsing the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking for the existence of the table. The issue arises from how the function expects the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to incorrect results in the table existence check.

### Bug Location
The bug in the function lies in how it processes the stdout from `run_hive_cmd`, either for cases where no partitions are specified or when partitions are specified in the query.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first case where no partitions are specified, the function executes a command to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug occurs when checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout`. The current implementation only checks if the `table` string is present in the `stdout` string, regardless of what else is in the `stdout` (like the 'OK' message).

2. In the second case where partitions are specified, the function constructs a command to show partitions for a specific table using the `self.partition_spec(partition)` function. The bug here is similar to the first case where it only checks for the presence of non-empty `stdout` to determine if the table exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the output from `run_hive_cmd`. We should ensure that the function correctly interprets the 'OK' message in stdout and uses it to determine the existence of the table. We also need to handle cases where partitions are specified without affecting the table existence check.

### Corrected Function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return 'OK' in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any('OK' in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))  # Check if 'OK' is present in any line of stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case with no partitions specified, we now check if 'OK' is present in the `stdout` to determine the existence of the table.
- For the case with partitions specified, we split the `stdout` by lines and check if 'OK' is present in any line to determine the existence of the table.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases and correctly determine the existence of tables in both scenarios.
