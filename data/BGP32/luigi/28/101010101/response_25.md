### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database by running Hive commands.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.
4. The failing test cases involve different scenarios where the stdout from the Hive commands is checked for the existence of the table name.
5. The bug is likely caused by incorrect parsing or comparison of the stdout output containing table names.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout output of the Hive commands. The function expects the exact table name to be present in the stdout without considering other potential output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function checks for the existence of the table name in the Hive command output. We should parse the stdout to extract the table names and then compare them with the input table name in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split()
            return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function will split the stdout by whitespace to extract the table names and then check if the input table name (case-insensitive) is present in the list of tables. For the partition case, it checks if the stdout is not empty to ensure the table exists.
