### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it is not correctly parsing the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table exists in the stdout output by doing a simple string check. However, this approach is incorrect because the stdout may contain multiple lines and the table name may not be on the first line.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it is checking for exact string match for the table name in the stdout. This approach will fail if the stdout contains other tables as well or the table name is not the first line in the output.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly parse the stdout output and check if the table name exists within all the lines in the output. We will split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if table is in any line of stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # stdout will not be parsed due to complexity in this condition
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking if the table name is present in any of the lines, we can fix the bug and make the function work correctly for the provided test cases.
