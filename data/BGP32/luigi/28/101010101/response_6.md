#### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` takes parameters `table`, `database`, and an optional `partition`.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks whether a table exists or not by calling `run_hive_cmd` function with different types of queries.
3. The issue arises from the logic inside the `table_exists` function where it's not correctly handling the case when `run_hive_cmd` returns the table name but with some extra information or special characters.
4. We need to adjust the logic of checking the existence of the table based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
5. The corrected version needs to handle the cases where the table name is appended with unwanted characters or information.

#### Plan
1. Modify the logic of checking the existence of the table by comparing the output from `run_hive_cmd` more intelligently.
2. Check the validity of the table name within the output string.
3. Strip any unwanted characters from the output string before comparison.

#### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
```

In the corrected version:
1. We split the `stdout` string by newline character '\n' to check for the table name existence more accurately.
2. We also modify the query string when checking with partitions to include `partition_str` instead of calling `self.partition_spec(partition)` within the format string.
3. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass all the failing test cases.
