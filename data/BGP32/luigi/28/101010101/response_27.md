### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic of the returned stdout with the expected table name.
2. The bug is likely caused by how the stdout is being checked for the table name presence.
3. In the failing tests, the expected table name is not being correctly identified in the output. The output is either not being split properly to find the table name or the comparison logic is incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that we split the stdout correctly to extract the table names. Then, we can simply check if the expected table name is in the list of extracted table names.
5. We will modify the function to appropriately split the stdout and then check if the table name is present.

### Correction
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))  # Updated command to list all tables in the database
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return bool(partitions)  # Check if there are any partitions returned

```

Now the corrected function should split the output correctly and check if the expected table name is present based on the split values. This fix should make the function return the correct results based on the expected values in the failing tests.
