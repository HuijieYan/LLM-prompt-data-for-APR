### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function expects the stdout to contain the table name when checking if the table exists. However, it fails to properly handle the cases where the stdout might contain extra newlines or is not an exact match.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the way the function handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the failing test cases, the returned stdout contains the table name but also includes extra newlines. The function's current logic to check for the presence of the table name is not robust enough to handle these cases.

### Fix strategy:
1. Modify the conditional check on stdout to handle cases where there might be extra whitespace characters or newlines.
2. Improve the logic to check for the presence of the table name more accurately.

### Corrected code:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout into a list of table names in case of multiple results and improved boolean check, the corrected function should handle the extra newlines and allow the function to return the expected results.
