### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database by using the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the table exists and returning the result based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The error message indicates that the buggy function is not returning the correct results, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.
4. The bug seems to stem from the way the output of `run_hive_cmd` is being handled in the `table_exists` function, especially when handling multi-line outputs.
5. We need to ensure that the function correctly captures the expected output from `run_hive_cmd` and returns True if the table exists based on that output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. We need to modify how we handle the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if the table exists.
2. Instead of just checking for the table name in the stdout, we should split the output by lines and check if the table name exists in any of those lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});"
        )
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
``` 

By splitting the stdout output into lines and checking if the table name exists in any of those lines, we ensure that the function correctly identifies if the table exists and returns the appropriate result.
