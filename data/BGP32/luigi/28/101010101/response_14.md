### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a specific database. The issue arises from the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` string obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The buggy function checks for the presence of the table name as a substring in `stdout`, leading to incorrect results. 

### Bug
The bug is occurring due to the way the function is checking for the table name in the `stdout` string. The function is using the `in` operator to check if the table exists, which is not accurate. The `in` operator checks for the presence of a substring, and it might cause false positives when the table name is part of other strings in the `stdout`.

### Fix
To fix this issue, we should split the lines in the `stdout` and check if any line matches exactly with the table name instead of using the `in` operator. This will ensure that we are correctly checking for the table name.

### Corrected Version

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # Split the lines in stdout to check for an exact match of table name
        table_lines = stdout.split("\n")
        return table in table_lines

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking for an exact match of the table name in the corrected version of the function, we ensure that false positives are avoided, and the correct check for table existence is performed based on the expected behavior.
