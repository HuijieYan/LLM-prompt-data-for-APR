### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because the conditional check for table existence is not correctly implemented. The bug arises from how the function processes the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It expects the table name to be present on each line separately, but in the failing test case, the table name is on the same line as the "OK" message. This inconsistency causes the function to incorrectly determine the table existence.

### Bug
The bug is in the conditional check for the table name. The buggy function checks if the table is in the `stdout` variable directly without properly parsing the output. This leads to incorrect results when the table name is included in the same line as other information in `stdout`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the `stdout` variable to extract the table names before performing the existence check. This involves splitting the `stdout` by '\n' to handle multiple table names properly. We also need to account for cases where 'OK' is present in the output but not the table names.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)  # If the output is not empty, assume table exists
```

By splitting the `stdout` by '\n' and checking if the table exists in the extracted table names, we can fix the bug and ensure the function works correctly for all the test cases provided.
