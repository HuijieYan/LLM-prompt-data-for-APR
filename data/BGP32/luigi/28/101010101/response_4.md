### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function checks if a table exists in a given database with optional partition details.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. It also utilizes the `partition_spec` method from the same class to generate partition details.
3. The failing test cases involve incorrect output validation leading to failed assertions. The code logic of checking table existence and parsing the output might be causing the discrepancies.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of tables and partitions by handling the output from `run_hive_cmd` appropriately.
5. By improving the logic and handling of command outputs, we can fix this bug.

### Bug Fix
```python
# Import the necessary mock library for testing
import mock

# Corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{}={}'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        return table in stdout if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- When a partition is provided, the function generates a formatted string for the partition details.
- The Hive command for checking partitions is executed with proper partition specification.
- The function now correctly checks for the table existence based on the command output.
- The function handles the case where `stdout` is empty and returns `False` in that instance.
