### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` has two branches: one for checking if a table exists without partition and another for checking with partition.
2. The issue arises from the comparison of the output `stdout` with the table name. In the first branch, the check is not properly performed leading to incorrect results.
3. The bug occurs because the `in` operator is used to check if the table name is present in stdout, but this may lead to false positives when the table name is a substring of another table.
4. To fix the bug, we should split the `stdout` into lines and then compare each line separately with the table name. This way, we ensure an exact match.
5. We will modify the `return` statement to address this issue.

### Correction
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Split on newline and check each line
        
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function `table_exists` will correctly split the `stdout` for each line and compare each line separately with the table name, ensuring that only exact matches are considered.
