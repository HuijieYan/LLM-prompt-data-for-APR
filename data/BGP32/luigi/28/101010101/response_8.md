### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to return the correct result because it checks if the table name is present in the output string from `run_hive_cmd`, which can lead to false negatives due to how the strings are being compared.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug lies in the comparison condition `table in stdout`. Here, the function is checking if the whole `table` name exists as a substring in `stdout`. But this check might be inaccurate and lead to false negatives if the table is not the complete content in `stdout`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to how the function compares the table name with the output. If there are additional characters or formatting in the `stdout`, the comparison can fail even if the table name is present.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` with newlines and then check if the exact `table` name is present in any of the lines. This approach will ensure that only the exact table name is being checked for existence in the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newlines before performing the check, we ensure that we are only comparing the entire table name and improving the accuracy of the check.
