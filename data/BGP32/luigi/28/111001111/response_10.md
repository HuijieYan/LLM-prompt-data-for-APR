Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function is currently directly comparing the table name to the output from Hive without considering case differences. To fix this, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread about table names being returned in lowercase by Hive, causing the tests to fail due to case mismatches.

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now accurately determine the existence of a table in Hive regardless of the case used in the comparison, aligning with the expectations outlined in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue descriptions.
