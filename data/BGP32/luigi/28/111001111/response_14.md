The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to incorrect results and test failures when table names are provided in different cases.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is present in the `table_exists` function where the `table` variable is not converted to lowercase for comparison with the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd`. This causes case sensitivity issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the comparison between `table` and `stdout` is case-sensitive. When the table names are provided in different cases, such as 'mytable' vs. 'MyTable', the comparison fails and leads to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, convert both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison and prevent the bug from occurring.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensuring correct behavior in all cases.
