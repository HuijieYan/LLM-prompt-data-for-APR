To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before checking for the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue. This change will resolve the failing tests and make the function behave as expected.
