The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function does a literal check for the table name in the Hive output, which can lead to issues when the case of the table name does not match exactly. The bug is outlined in the provided GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive?" with a proposed fix to make the comparison case insensitive.

The strategy to fix the bug involves modifying the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Updated version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the reported bug in the function.

By making this simple adjustment to the comparison logic, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
