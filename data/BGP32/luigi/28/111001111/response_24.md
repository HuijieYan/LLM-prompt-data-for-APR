Based on the GitHub issue mentioned, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names. To fix this issue, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With these changes, the `table_exists` function will now compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue related to table names being considered as different due to case differences.
