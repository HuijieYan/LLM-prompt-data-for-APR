The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, which causes case sensitivity issues. The `table_exists` function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons properly, leading to test failures when tables are defined with different casing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison check to use case-insensitive comparisons. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database. This corrected version addresses the issue reported on GitHub and provides the expected behavior for the function.
