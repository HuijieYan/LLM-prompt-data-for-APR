The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue described in the GitHub thread highlights this problem, where tables defined with different cases (e.g., capitalized) can lead to test failures due to Hive returning table names in lowercase.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this change, the function will convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison, resolving the case sensitivity issue highlighted in the GitHub issue.
