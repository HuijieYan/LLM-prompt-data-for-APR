### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when comparing the provided table name with the tables returned by `hive`. Hive is case-insensitive, so the comparison should also be case-insensitive. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when the table names are in different cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the tables returned by `hive` to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
