The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name as is with the output from the Hive command, which could be in a different case, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction ensures that both the table name and the output from the Hive command are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This fixes the issue described in the GitHub report and aligns with the expected input/output values provided.
