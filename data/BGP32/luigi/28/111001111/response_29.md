Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue reported on GitHub, and the provided runtime and expected values, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout with the given table name. The function should handle case insensitivity by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing, ensuring case insensitivity and fixing the issue reported on GitHub.

This fix addresses the problem of case sensitivity in table names when checking for table existence in Hive.
