### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner. To resolve this issue, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase in the comparison, this corrected version of the function will be able to correctly identify the existence of tables regardless of case sensitivity.
