The bug identified in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function should be modified to be case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive, which returns table names in lowercase.

The bug arises because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which can be in lowercase even if the input table name is in uppercase or mixed case. This causes the comparison to fail, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be done in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both table name and the output to lowercase, the function will now be able to correctly determine the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug reports.
