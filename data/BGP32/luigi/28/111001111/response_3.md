Based on the analysis of the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is that it directly compares the table name with the output from Hive, which can differ in case sensitivity. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case-insensitive, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This fix aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the problem reported on GitHub.
