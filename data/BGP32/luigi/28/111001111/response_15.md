Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for existing tables in Hive. The function needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison to correctly determine if a table exists. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison logic to handle case differences properly.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Import necessary modules
import re

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return stdout and any(re.match(r"{0}".format(re.escape(table.lower())), line.lower()) for line in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use the `re` module to perform a case-insensitive search for the table name within the output of the `show tables` command in the Hive CLI. This ensures that we can find the table regardless of the case.
2. We modify the return logic to check for a match between the lowercased table name and each line of the output.
3. For the case when a partition is specified, we simply return a boolean indicating if the `stdout` is non-empty.

By implementing these changes, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
