The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity of table name comparison in Hive. The function is checking for an exact match between the table name provided and the table name retrieved from the stdout of the Hive command, which may cause failures when there are differences in case.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` variable and the strings in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
