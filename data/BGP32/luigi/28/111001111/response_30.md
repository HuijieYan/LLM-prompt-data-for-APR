To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the `stdout`. This will ensure that tables with different case conventions are correctly identified.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, we are ensuring that the comparison is case-insensitive. This change aligns with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue and will address the problem of failing tests related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
