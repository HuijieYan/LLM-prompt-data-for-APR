The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug causes the function to fail when tables with different case formats are evaluated. To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before performing the comparison, making the check case insensitive.

By implementing this fix, the function `table_exists` will now correctly detect the existence of tables in a Hive database without being affected by case sensitivity issues as reported in the GitHub issues.
