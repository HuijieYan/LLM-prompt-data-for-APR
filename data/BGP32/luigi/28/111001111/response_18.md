The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it does a case-sensitive check for the table name against the output from the Hive command, leading to incorrect results when the table names have different cases. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before performing the check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase, the comparison will be case-insensitive, which will fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug report. The function will now correctly identify whether a table exists regardless of the case used in the table name.
