After analyzing the code and the provided information, it is clear that the issue arises from the case sensitivity of the table name when checking for its existence in the Hive database. The bug stems from the fact that the table name comparison is case sensitive, leading to failures when the table names are in different cases.

To fix this issue, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to the same case (lowercase) before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison to make the check case insensitive. This modification ensures that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
