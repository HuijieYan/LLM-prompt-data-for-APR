The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the `stdout` output from the Hive command. The table names are not being properly normalized for case sensitivity, leading to test failures on case mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output is case insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output, resolving the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
