### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the response to determine if the table exists.

The bug seems to be in the logic of checking the presence of the table in the response from `run_hive_cmd`. In the current implementation, the function checks if the table name is present in the response, which may not be accurate as the response could contain multiple table names or other information.

### Bug:
The bug is in the condition where the function checks if the table name is in the output of `run_hive_cmd` for both cases of partition being None and having a value.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to handle the output response better. We should modify the condition to check if the table name is an exact match in the response, considering cases where the response may contain multiple table names.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip().split('\n').count(table) > 0
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.strip().split('\n').count(table) > 0
```

By splitting the output by `\n` and counting the occurrences of the table name within the response, we ensure a more accurate check for the table existence in both cases. This correction should now pass all the expected test cases.
