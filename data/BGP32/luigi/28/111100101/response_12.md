## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The bug is related to how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in both cases where `partition` is `None` and when it is provided.

## Bug
The bug lies in the way the function interprets the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the case where the table exists, the function should return `True`, but currently, it returns `True` only if the table name is found in the stdout without considering other possible output cases (like OK message). Similarly, the function should return `False` if the table does not exist, but it is not handling this case correctly either.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly interprets the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should update the logic to handle different possible outputs and verify that the table existence is indeed being determined correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return "OK" not in stdout  # Check if "OK" is not present in the stdout

    stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty
``` 

The corrected version of the function accurately checks for the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't, while also handling different possible output cases.

By making these changes, the function should now pass all the expected cases provided and correctly determine the existence of a table in a Hive database.
