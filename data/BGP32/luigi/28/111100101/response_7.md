### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a given table exists in the specified database by running a Hive command. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` output of the Hive command. The function then returns `True` if the table is found in the output, and `False` otherwise. 

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the expected `stdout` output correctly. The function expects to find the table name as a separate line in the `stdout` output. However, in the failing test case where the table name is part of the same line as the `'OK'` response, the function fails to recognize it. Hence, the function incorrectly returns `False` when it should return `True`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the comparison of the `table` in the `stdout` output of the Hive command. This line: `return stdout and table in stdout` is causing the issue because it does not handle cases where the table name is part of the same line as other content in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` output. We should split the lines in `stdout` and then check if the table name exists on any of those lines. This will ensure that the table name is correctly identified even if it is in the same line as other content. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newlines and then checking if the `table` exists in any of those lines, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table in the Hive command output.

The corrected `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
