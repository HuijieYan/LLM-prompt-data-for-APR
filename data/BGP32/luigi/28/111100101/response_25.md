### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a database and optionally in a given partition.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the function is handling the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking if the table exists.
3. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is problematic as it checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty and if the `table` is in `stdout`, which might not be accurate in all cases.
4. We need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and properly handles both table existence and partition specification.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation lies in how the function handles the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not checking the existence of the table correctly, as it only verifies if the `table` string is in `stdout`, which can be misleading.

### Proposed Fix
1. We should split the `stdout` into lines if it contains multiple entries.
2. Then we can check if the `table` exists in any line of the `stdout`.
3. In the case of partitions, we need to ensure that the partition specification is properly formatted.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(table == t for t in tables)
        else:
            return False
        
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking for the presence of the table in any line, we ensure a more reliable check for the table's existence. Additionally, the partition specification should be correctly formatted to check for the partition's existence. This corrected implementation should pass all the failing test cases provided.
