1. Analyzing the buggy function, we can see that it checks for the existence of a table in a given database using the `table_exists` method. The issue seems to be in the way the function is checking the `stdout` response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The logic for checking if the table exists is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect returns in the test cases.

2. Potential error locations in the buggy function:
   - Incorrect handling of `stdout` variable after running the Hive command.
   - Incorrect comparison of the table name in the `stdout`.

3. The cause of the bug:
   - In the `table_exists` function, when checking if the table exists, the comparison logic with the `stdout` response is not done accurately, leading to incorrect results in the test cases. The expectation is that the function should return True if the table exists in the database and False otherwise, based on the `stdout` response.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the comparison logic to correctly check if the table name is in the `stdout` response for both cases where `partition` is None and when `partition` is provided.

5. Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By updating the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it should now correctly check if the table exists in the database based on the `stdout` response from the Hive command, resolving the incorrect returns in the test cases.
