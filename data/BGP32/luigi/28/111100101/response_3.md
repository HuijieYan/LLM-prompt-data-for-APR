### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly handling the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is checking if the table name is in the stdout string, which is causing issues with different formats of stdout responses. Additionally, the function is returning `False` or `True` based on whether the stdout exists, rather than checking for the table name specifically.

### Bug
The bug lies in the way the `table_exists` function is checking for the existence of a table within the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It simply checks if stdout exists and does not accurately determine if the table name is present in the stdout. This leads to incorrect returns and failing tests.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we should check if the table name exists in the stdout response using a more robust method. Additionally, we should handle the different formats of the stdout response more effectively.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we split the stdout response on `\n` before checking if the table name exists in it. This allows us to accurately determine the presence of the table name within the different formats of the stdout response.
