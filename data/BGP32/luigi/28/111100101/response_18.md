### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is performing a check to see if a table exists in a database, with an option to include partition information.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect string construction and parsing within the function.
3. The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the table is included in the output but not surrounded by newlines or spaces, leading to incorrect evaluation.
4. A potential strategy to fix the bug is to modify the condition to check if the table name is exactly equal to the expected table name rather than just being present in the output. Additionally, ensure that the partition information is correctly formatted for the query.

### Updated Function
```python
# fixing the buggy table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
```

By splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` on newlines and checking for the exact table name in each line, we ensure an accurate check for table existence. Additionally, the partition information is correctly constructed in the query. This updated function should pass all the failing test cases.
