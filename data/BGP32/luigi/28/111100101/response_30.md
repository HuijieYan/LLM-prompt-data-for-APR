### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the command.
2. The function has two branches - one for when no partition is specified and the other for when a partition is specified.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output (`stdout`) of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The failing test cases provide specific scenarios with input parameter values and the expected behavior of the function.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable, which stores the output of the Hive command execution. The buggy function checks whether the `stdout` contains the table name, but it does not handle newline characters that may be present in the actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to properly handle newline characters in the `stdout` variable.
2. Modify the logic to check if the table name is in the lines of the `stdout` variable, instead of a direct match.
3. Update the `table_exists` function to return `True` only if the table name is found in the output lines from the Hive command.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout is not empty and return True

# Fixing the function to split the stdout by lines and check table in each line
```

By making these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should now properly handle the output of the Hive command and pass all the failing test cases.
