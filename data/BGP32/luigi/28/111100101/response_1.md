### Analysis
The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. This function checks for the existence of a table in a given database with an optional partition. The bug seems to be in how the function is checking for the existence of the table based on the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check of the `stdout` value after running the `hive` command. The function currently checks whether `stdout` exists and if the table name is in it, which is incorrect. The correct logic should be to check if the table name is in the lines of the `stdout` as each line represents a table name or a partition specification.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to split the lines of the `stdout` and check if the table name is in one of those lines. We should modify the conditional check to iterate over each line in `stdout` and check if the table name exists in any of those lines. If found, return `True`, else return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version of the function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` on newlines and checking for the existence of the table name in each line separately, the corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
