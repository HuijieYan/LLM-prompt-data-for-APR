### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command using the `run_hive_cmd` function. If a partition is specified, it also includes the partition information in the command.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic in the if-else block where it checks for the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug might be due to the incorrect logic in checking the correctness of the `stdout` variable after running the Hive command.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve checking if the table exists in the stdout correctly and returning the appropriate value based on that.

### Correction
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the return statements to explicitly check the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
