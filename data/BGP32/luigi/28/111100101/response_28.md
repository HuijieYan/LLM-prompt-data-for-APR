## Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is checking if a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the command.
2. The function has a conditional statement to handle the case where a partition is provided.
3. The bug in the function seems to be related to the comparison of the stdout from the Hive command.
4. The bug appears to be in the conditional checks where the function expects `stdout` to contain specific strings and then return `True`. The current comparison logic might not be accurate.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would involve ensuring that the conditionals are correctly checking the `stdout` output against the expected values.

## Bug Fix
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_string = ", ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_string))
        
        return table in stdout
```

I have updated the function to correctly compare the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function with the expected table names or partition strings. I have also fixed the formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block for the partition case. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
