### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database with optional partition information.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the stdout is being checked to determine if the table exists.
3. The bug is likely caused by not handling the case where the table name is part of a larger string in stdout, causing false positives when checking for table existence.
4. To fix the bug, a more robust check for the table name within the stdout is needed.

### Correction
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and f"\n{table}\n" in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})"
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

            return stdout and f"\n{partition_str}\n" in stdout
```

By using the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, it now checks for exact matches of the table name and partition information in the stdout, avoiding false positives and ensuring correct detection of table existence based on the expected values and types in the failing tests.
