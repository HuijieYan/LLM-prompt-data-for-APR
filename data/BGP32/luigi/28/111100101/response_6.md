### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking whether a given table exists in a database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine the existence of the table. The function returns `True` if the table is found in the output and `False` otherwise. The issue may lie in how the function checks for the table existence based on the output.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function is checking for the exact presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. However, the function should actually be checking if the table name is present as a separate entity in the `stdout` string. The buggy logic of `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect as it only checks for an exact match of the table name in the entire `stdout` string.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to check for the table name as a separate entity within the `stdout` string. We can split the `stdout` string by newlines and then check if the table name exists in the resulting list of strings.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and any(table == tbl.strip() for tbl in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string by newline characters and then searching for the exact match of the table name in the resulting list, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the table existence in the database.
