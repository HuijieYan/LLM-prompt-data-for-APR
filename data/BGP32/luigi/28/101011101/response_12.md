### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison of the `table` with the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the table name exists in the stdout by using `table in stdout`, which can lead to incorrect results because the table name might match a substring in the stdout, resulting in false positives.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the way the table name is checked in the output. Instead of directly checking if the table name is in the stdout, we need to split the stdout by newline characters and then check if any of the lines exactly match the table name. This will prevent false positives due to partial matches.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version of the function:
- For the case when partition is None, we split the stdout by newline character and check if any line exactly matches the table name.
- For the case when partition is provided, we simply check if the stdout is not empty to determine if the table exists.
- The corrections ensure that the function accurately determines if a table exists in the given database without false positives.
