### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to be related to how the `table_exists` function is checking for the existence of a table in the Hive command output. Specifically, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command might not be done correctly, causing the test cases to fail. 

To fix this bug, we should update the comparison logic to properly check if the table name exists in the Hive command output. This can be achieved by splitting the output by newline characters and then checking if the table name is present in the resulting list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Updated comparison logic
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Simplified return statement
``` 

By splitting the output of the Hive command by newline characters and then checking if the table name exists in the resulting list, the corrected function should now properly detect the table's existence in the Hive database and pass the failing tests.
