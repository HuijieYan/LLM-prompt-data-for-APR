The bug in the provided function is that it fails to correctly check if the table exists in the database. The bug is primarily causing the function to return the incorrect values, leading to failing test cases. 

The issue stems from the logic used to check if the table exists in the database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and fetch the entries. However, the logic for parsing and checking the output is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and accurately determines if the table exists in the database.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partitions))

            return stdout and partitions in stdout.splitlines()
```

In the corrected version:
1. For tables without partition, we fetch all tables in the database using `show tables` and then check if the table exists by splitting the output and comparing it against the table name.
2. For tables with partitions, we fetch the partition specifications first, then check if the specific partition exists by splitting the output and comparing it against the partition specifications.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
