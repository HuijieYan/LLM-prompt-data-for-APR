### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in how the `table_exists` function checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation checks if the table's name is directly in the output without considering the formatting or other tables that might be present. This leads to incorrect results when the table name is part of another string in the output. The buggy function does not account for this scenario.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `table_exists` function checks for the table's existence in the output. One way to solve this is to split the output by newline characters and then check each line for the exact match of the table name. This approach would prevent false positives that might arise due to similar table names or formatting in the output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version:
1. We split the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters to get a list of tables.
2. We then iterate over each table and compare the stripped version of the table name with the target table name to check for an exact match.
3. For the partitioned case, we check if the output is not None to determine if the table exists.

By making these changes, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the presence of the table by comparing the exact table name in the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command.
