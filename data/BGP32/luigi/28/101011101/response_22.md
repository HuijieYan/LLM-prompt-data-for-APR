### Bug Fixing Strategy
The bug lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout`. The buggy function checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout` string, which could lead to false positives. For example, if the `table` name is a substring of another table name present in `stdout`, the comparison would return true incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` string obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function and compare each line separately with the `table` name. This way, we ensure an exact match with the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` on newline characters before checking if the `table` name is in it. This modification ensures that we are looking for an exact match rather than a partial one, fixing the bug in the function.
