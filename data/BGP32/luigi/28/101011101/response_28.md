The bug in the provided function is related to how it checks for the existence of a table in a database. The function is incorrectly parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

The bug seems to be in the logic that checks if the table exists in the output returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout string, but this check is incorrect if the table name appears in the output along with other information. This causes the function to return the wrong result, leading to failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        pass
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now splits the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function by newline characters and checks if the table name exists in one of the lines. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies the table existence and returns the expected results.

By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
