### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to the condition check when `partition` is `None`. The function checks if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function when querying the Hive table. If the table name is found in the output, the function returns `True`, otherwise `False`. 

However, the issue lies in the comparison of the table name with the output. If the table name is present in the output, the check should return `True`, but the buggy code is performing an `and` operation, which results in a logical error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logical operation for checking the existence of the table in the output needs to be corrected. Instead of using `stdout and table in stdout`, it should be replaced with `stdout is not None and table in stdout` to correctly check if the table is present in the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function replaces the logical operation with `stdout is not None and table in stdout` to ensure that the correct condition is checked for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive command.
