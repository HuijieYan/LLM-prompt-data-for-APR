The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the condition where the function checks if the table name is in the result of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue is that it does not account for cases where the table name could appear as a prefix in the result, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to ensure that the table name is a separate word in the output string. We can achieve this by adding word boundary checks in the condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
    
            return stdout and f'\\b{table}\\b' in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} '
                                  f'partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By adding `\\b` before and after the table name in the condition, we ensure that the table name is a whole word in the result, preventing partial matches. This modification should fix the bug and make the function return the expected results for the failing tests.
