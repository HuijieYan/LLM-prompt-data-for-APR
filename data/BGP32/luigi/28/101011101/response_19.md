## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks if the table is in the `stdout` variable returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. When the `table` is in the first line of `stdout`, the function incorrectly returns `False` instead of `True`.

### Analysis
When the test case provides the table name in the first line of the stdout, the function fails to correctly identify the existence of the table due to the condition where it checks for `stdout and table in stdout`. Since the `stdout` contains the table name in the first line, the condition evaluates to `False`.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check on the `stdout` variable to accurately determine if the table exists. One solution is to split the `stdout` string by lines and check if the table exists in any of those lines. Additionally, it's crucial to handle the case where `stdout` is empty.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # No need for an explicit check, return the boolean value directly
```

By implementing this corrected code, the function will now correctly detect whether the table exists in the specific cases provided.
