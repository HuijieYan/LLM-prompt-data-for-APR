The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout. The issue is with the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, where it checks if `table` is in `stdout`. In the failing test cases, the table name is followed by a newline character `'\n'`, causing the comparison to fail. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to consider the newline character. We can split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the `table` is in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction splits the `stdout` by newline characters and then checks if the `table` is present in the resulting list, thus addressing the issue of the failing tests due to the presence of newline characters.
