### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how it checks if the table exists in the database when partition is None. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to get the list of tables in the given database and then checks if the input table is in that list. However, the check is done without proper parsing of the output, leading to incorrect detections.

In the failing test cases, especially in Case 2, the table name in the output includes a newline character (`\n`) along with the table name, causing the equality check to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how we check if the table exists in the database when partition is None. Instead of checking if the input table name is in the raw stdout output, we should parse the stdout response properly to compare against the table name.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the tables in the output by newline characters and then checks if the input table matches any of the tables correctly. It also ensures proper handling of the boolean output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test cases.
