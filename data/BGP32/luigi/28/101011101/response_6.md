### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the function checks for the presence of a table in the Hive database. When the function receives a command output from `run_hive_cmd`, it checks if the table name is in the output to determine if the table exists. However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the table name is part of a larger string in the command output, leading to false negatives.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of how we check for the existence of the table. Instead of a direct string comparison, we can split the output based on newline characters and then check if the exact table name exists in any of the lines.

### Corrected Function

```python
# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_list = stdout.split('\n')
    
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in table_list)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            table_list = stdout.split('\n')
    
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in table_list)
```

By splitting the command output into lines and checking for the exact presence of the table name in each line, we ensure a more accurate check for the existence of the table. This correction addresses the bug and should now pass the failing tests.
