### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional logic used to determine if a table exists in a given database. When the function checks for the existence of a table without any specified partition, it utilizes the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and searches for the table name within that output. However, the bug arises from the logic used to perform this check.

In the conditional statement:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```

The function incorrectly assumes that having a non-empty `stdout` string means the table exists. This is not a reliable check since `stdout` may contain other unrelated information. Instead, the function should focus on whether the table name is explicitly present in the `stdout` output.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug

To address the bug, the function needs to accurately check if the table name exists in the output generated by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can be achieved by splitting the lines of the `stdout` output and checking each line individually for an exact match with the table name. Additionally, it is essential to consider case sensitivity during the comparison to handle situations where the table name might be in a different case.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now correctly checks for the existence of a table within the `stdout` output by splitting the lines and comparing each table name in a case-insensitive manner. This modification ensures more reliable detection of table existence.
