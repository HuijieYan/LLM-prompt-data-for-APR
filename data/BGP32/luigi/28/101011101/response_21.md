The bug in the provided function is due to how the function checks for the existence of a table in a database. In the `table_exists` function, when checking for the existence of a table in the database, the function only checks if the table name is in the returned output. However, the function does not account for case sensitivity or variations in the returned output format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle case sensitivity and variations in the returned output. We can modify the function to handle different cases by converting both the table names and the output to a consistent case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of partition_spec function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                    ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the corrected function now converts both the table name and the content of the output to lowercase for comparison. This ensures that the function is case-insensitive and can handle variations in the returned output format.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
