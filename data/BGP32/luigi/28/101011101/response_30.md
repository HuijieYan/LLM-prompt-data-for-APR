The bug in the provided function lies in how the `table_exists` function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The issue is that the function improperly determines whether the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The problem arises from the inconsistent handling of the `stdout` variable, which stores the output of the Hive command. In the `if` statement checking for the table existence, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` can be misleading. Here, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty and then if the `table` is in `stdout`, but this might lead to unexpected behavior.

A better approach to checking for table existence is to split the `stdout` by newline characters and check if the table name exactly matches any of the lines after splitting. This way, we can avoid issues related to the formatting of the output.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return bool(partitions)
```

By splitting the `stdout` using newline characters in both cases, we ensure that we are more accurately checking for the existence of the specific table or partition. This corrected version should address the issues with the buggy function and pass the failing tests.
