### Bug Description
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition set for checking the existence of the table. The function checks if the table is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it does not consider the formatting of the output correctly. Specifically, when the table name is in the stdout but not on its own line, the function fails to identify it as existing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table name is in the stdout. We should split the stdout by lines and then check if the table name is one of the lines, instead of directly checking if the table name is in the entire string of stdout.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout by lines and checking if the table name is present in any of those lines, the corrected version should now correctly determine whether the table exists or not, passing the failing tests.
