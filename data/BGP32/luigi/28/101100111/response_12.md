### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity; the function currently compares the table name directly against the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect results due to case mismatches.
3. The failing test case checks for table existence with different cases (e.g., "mytable" vs. "MyTable"), causing the function to fail when comparing the table name with the stdout from the Hive command.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function will be able to correctly determine the existence of the table disregarding the case sensitivity. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.
