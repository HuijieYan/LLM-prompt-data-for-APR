Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue on GitHub, and the failing test cases, the main cause of the bug is the case sensitivity in comparing table names. The function `table_exists` is currently performing a direct comparison between the provided table name and the table names in the stdout without considering case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table names and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                    use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)
                    """ % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now handle case insensitivity correctly, resolving the issue raised on GitHub and passing all the failing test cases.
