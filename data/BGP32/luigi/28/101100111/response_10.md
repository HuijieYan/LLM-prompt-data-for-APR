## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks for table existence in a case-sensitive manner, which leads to failing test cases when the table names vary in case. The function needs to be modified to become case-insensitive according to the GitHub issue description.

## Potential Error Locations
The issue lies in the comparison of the table name with the output `stdout` without converting them to lowercase.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the fact that the table name and the actual reflection of the table name in the `stdout` are case-sensitive. Due to Hive being case-insensitive and returning the table names in lowercase, a direct case-sensitive comparison results in incorrect evaluations.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This change will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, as required by the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.
