The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when checking for table existence. In the failing test cases, the function fails to correctly identify table existence due to differences in case between the provided table name and the table names returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. This discrepancy leads to incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output table names to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function should now pass all the failing test cases described above, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
