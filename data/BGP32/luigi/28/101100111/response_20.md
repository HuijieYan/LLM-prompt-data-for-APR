### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `hive.py` file in the Luigi library has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity when checking for tables in Hive. This issue is reported in GitHub issue #896 and the failing tests demonstrate the problem.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity.
2. Inadequate handling of table names coming from the stdout in lowercase.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function directly compares the table names without considering case sensitivity, leading to false negatives in certain cases where the table names have different casing than expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive. Before comparing the table names, we should convert both the expected table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

After making the changes above in the `table_exists` function, it should pass all the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised in GitHub.
