The cause of the bug in the provided function `table_exists` stems from the comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The case sensitivity of the comparison causes the test to fail when the table names do not match case. To resolve this bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

This corrected version should satisfy all the expected cases provided and pass the failing test cases.
