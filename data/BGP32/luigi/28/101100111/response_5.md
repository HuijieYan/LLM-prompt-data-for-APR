The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. When checking if a table exists, it directly compares the table name with the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, Hive is case-insensitive, meaning that the table name in the output could be in a different case (either upper or lower) compared to the input table name. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases where the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before performing the check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lower case before performing the comparison. This ensures that the function is case-insensitive when checking if a table exists.

By making this change, the function will now pass all the failing test cases provided, addressing the issue reported on GitHub and making the `table_exists` function truly case insensitive.
