### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is designed to check if a table exists in a given database.
2. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine the existence of the table.
3. The bug arises when comparing the table name with the table names present in the output. The issue is highlighted in the GitHub problem statement where case sensitivity is causing test failures.
4. The function needs to be modified to make the comparison case-insensitive to resolve the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the names present in the stdout, leading to incorrect results for table existence.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison operation to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive in the corrected function, we address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
