After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the issue in the `table_exists` function where the comparison between the table name and the stdout is not case insensitive. The expected behavior is for the comparison to be case insensitive to match the expectation outlined in the GitHub issue #896.

The bug occurs because the comparison in the `table_exists` function is case sensitive. Instead of directly comparing `table` with `stdout`, we need to convert both to lowercase before the comparison. This change will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during the comparison, we ensure case insensitivity. This corrected version of the function will pass all the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values. It will also address the issue raised in GitHub issue #896.
