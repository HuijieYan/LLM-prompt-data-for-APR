### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in Hive based on the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table names.
3. The bug arises because the comparison in the buggy function is case sensitive, which leads to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to case sensitivity in comparing the table names in the `table_exists` function, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function corrected
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
