### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the database using Hive commands. The issue with the current implementation is that it does a case-sensitive check when comparing the table name against the output from the Hive command, leading to failures in tests that expect case-insensitive behavior.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The potential error location in the buggy function is the comparison between `table` and `stdout`.

### Explanation of the Bug

- In the failing test case, the test expects that the function should perform a case-insensitive check for table names when comparing with the output from Hive commands.
- The current implementation directly compares `table` with the output `stdout`, which fails in cases where the table name has a different case than what is returned by Hive (case-insensitivity).
- The failing test cases reflect scenarios where the buggy function should return `True`, but due to case sensitivity, it returns `False`.

### Suggested Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name with the output to be case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the corrected function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence in the database. This modification should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases.

The corrected function ensures that the expected input/output values mentioned in the failing test cases are satisfied, resolving the case sensitivity issue with table existence checks in the Hive environment.
