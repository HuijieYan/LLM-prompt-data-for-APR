### Identified Bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This leads to failing test cases when tables have different case representations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from comparing the table name directly to the table names retrieved from the Hive command output without case conversion. Since Hive is case insensitive, this leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
            use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the values in `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, this corrected version ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to making the function case insensitive.
