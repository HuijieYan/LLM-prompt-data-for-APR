## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output. The bug arises from the case sensitivity issue in comparing table names.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name extracted from the stdout with the given table name for case sensitivity.
3. The bug leads to failed test cases where the table names do not match exactly due to case differences, causing the function to return incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the extracted table name and the given table name to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table names to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database.
