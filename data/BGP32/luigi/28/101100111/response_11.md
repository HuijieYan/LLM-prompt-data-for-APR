After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to failing test cases when different cases in table names are compared.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case insensitive. This modification should fix the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub.

The corrected function should now pass all the provided failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
