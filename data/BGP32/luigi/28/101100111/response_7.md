After analyzing the buggy function, the issue described on GitHub, and the failing test cases, it is evident that the bug arises from the case sensitivity of the table names. The `table_exists` function is failing to handle case-insensitive table name comparisons properly. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking it against the stdout. This adjustment addresses the case sensitivity issue and aligns the function behavior with the expected outcomes in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This modification addresses the bug and should make the function pass all the failing test cases related to case sensitivity.

Feel free to integrate this corrected version into the codebase to resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
