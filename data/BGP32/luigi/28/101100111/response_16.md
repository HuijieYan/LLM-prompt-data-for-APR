### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class incorrectly compares the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` without converting them to lowercase. This causes issues when the table names have different case styles.
2. The failing test for the `table_exists` function covers multiple scenarios including case sensitivity in table names.
3. The bug arises from the case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the output of `run_hive_cmd`. If the table name's case doesn't match exactly with the output case, the comparison fails.
4. To fix the bug, the table name should be converted to lowercase before comparison with the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will make the comparison case insensitive.
5. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we can ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This corrected version should pass all the failing cases provided and resolve the issue on GitHub related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
