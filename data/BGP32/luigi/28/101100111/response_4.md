### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists()` checks if a table exists in a given database. If a partition is provided, it also includes the partition information in the query. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd()` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
2. The bug in the function lies in the comparison of the table name with the stdout output. It does not account for case sensitivity, leading to failures in certain scenarios.
3. The failing test case provides different scenarios with TABLE names and checks if the function correctly identifies their existence. The issue reported on GitHub suggests making the comparison case insensitive to address this problem.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the comparison of table names with the stdout to use a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the comparison of table names in the `stdout` to be case insensitive.
2. Modify the function to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lower case before comparison.

### Corrected Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison of table names case insensitive by lowercasing both the table name and `stdout` before checking for existence, the corrected function should pass all the provided test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
