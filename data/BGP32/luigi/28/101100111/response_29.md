Analyzing the buggy function `table_exists`, we can see that it fails to properly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The expected behavior should be case insensitivity, where the function should return True if the table exists in any case variation.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output of the Hive command, leading to a case-sensitive match. This results in test failures when table names are in different cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison `table in stdout`, which does not consider case insensitivity.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive, fixing the bug and allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
