The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function doesn't handle case insensitivity, causing test failures.

To fix the bug:
1. Modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both `table` and the `stdout` output to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this fix, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, resolving the test failures and addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
