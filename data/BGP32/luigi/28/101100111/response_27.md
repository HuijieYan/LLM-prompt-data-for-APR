### Analysis:
1. The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands and check the existence of a table.
2. The bug occurs when checking for table existence with case sensitivity issues, as highlighted in GitHub issues #896 and the failing test cases.
3. The bug arises due to direct comparison of table names without considering case differences, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity when comparing table names extracted from the command output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert table names to lowercase before comparing them with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Update the return statements to return `True` if the table exists (irrespective of case) in the output provided by `run_hive_cmd`.
3. Implement the changes based on the analysis and the provided test cases to validate the bug fix.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, the bug related to case sensitivity in table existence checks should be fixed. The corrected version ensures case insensitivity by converting both table names to lowercase before comparing them in the stdout output.

This corrected version should pass all the provided failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
