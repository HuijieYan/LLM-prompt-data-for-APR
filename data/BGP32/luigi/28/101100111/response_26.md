The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the comparison of table names which is case-sensitive. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase in the comparison, we address the case sensitivity issue. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue discussions and suggestions outlined.

The corrected function should now pass all the test cases mentioned and satisfy the expected input/output values.
