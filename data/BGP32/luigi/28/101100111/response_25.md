There are two main issues in the buggy function:
1. In the `table_exists` function, the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case sensitive, leading to test failures when there are case differences.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not being handled properly in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparisons case insensitive, the corrected function will pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.

Additionally, the `run_hive_cmd` function behavior should be properly mocked in the test cases to ensure accurate testing.
