### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly when checking the existence of a table in Hive.
- The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to run Hive commands and check the output to determine if a table exists.
- The failing test cases are related to the correct identification of tables with different cases in Hive.
- The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make `table_exists` function case insensitive for table names.
- The issue reported in GitHub by Lin suggests a solution to fix the problem by comparing the table name in lowercase with the output from Hive.

### Identified Issue:
- The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of tables in Hive. It directly checks whether the table name is present in the output without considering case differences, which leads to failing test cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity.
- When the table names have different cases, the comparison fails incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive, making the comparison case insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary:
- The bug in the `table_exists` function has been fixed by making the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
- The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
- This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896 and addresses the reported problem effectively.
