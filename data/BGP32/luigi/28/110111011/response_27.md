### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity properly. The function compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering the case. This leads to test failures when the case of the table name in Hive differs from the input table name.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive. When a table name like 'FooBar' is checked against the output 'foobar' from Hive, the comparison fails due to different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version will be able to handle case-insensitive table name comparisons.
