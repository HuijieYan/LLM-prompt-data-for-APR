Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name to the output of the Hive command. The `stdout` is not being converted to lower case before comparison, leading to test failures on case-sensitive comparisons.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert both to lower case for case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The changes made involve converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lower case before the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
