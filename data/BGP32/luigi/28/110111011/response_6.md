### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database using hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
3. The failing test cases are asserting the incorrect result due to case sensitivity in table names when comparing with the returned `stdout`.
4. The bug is causing the tests to fail because the comparison between the table names in the `stdout` and the input table name is case sensitive.
5. To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the names in `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Perform case-insensitive comparison for better compatibility.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub.
