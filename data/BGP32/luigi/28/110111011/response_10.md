### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from a case-sensitivity issue where the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, leading to failing tests when the table names are in different cases (capitalized vs. lower case). The function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison to resolve this issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split("\n"))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function implements a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence. This modification ensures that the function can handle tables with names in different cases correctly.

By using this corrected function, the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues should pass successfully.
