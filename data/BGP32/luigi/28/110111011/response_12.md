### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of table names. The function checks if the table name exists in the output of a Hive command. However, this check is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the case of the table names does not match exactly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The failing test cases provide different scenarios where the table names are either in different cases or contain additional information due to partition specification. The function only checks for an exact match, leading to failures when the names are not in the same case.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix strategy involves converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This will make the check case-insensitive and resolve the failures seen in the test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version should now handle case-insensitive checks and pass the failing test cases.
