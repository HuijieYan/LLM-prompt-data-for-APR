The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. The function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly, leading to test failures.

To address this bug, we need to modify the function to ensure that the table name comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (
                database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them in a case-insensitive manner. This adjustment ensures that the function behaves as expected during table existence checks.

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
