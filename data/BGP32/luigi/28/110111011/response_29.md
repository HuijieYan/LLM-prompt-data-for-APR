### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `table` name with the content of `stdout` when checking for table existence. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison should also be case-insensitive to handle scenarios where the table name case does not match exactly with the case in `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the `table` name and the content of `stdout` to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the corrected version ensures the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the failing test.
