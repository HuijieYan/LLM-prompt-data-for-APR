### Explanation:
The issue arises due to the case sensitivity in comparing the table name against the tables listed in the stdout. The function `table_exists` currently performs a direct comparison without considering the case of the table names.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the names in the stdout to lowercase for comparison. This will make the comparison case insensitive and ensure that the tests pass.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By including the `.lower()` method on both the table name and the stdout comparisons, we ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the tests pass.
