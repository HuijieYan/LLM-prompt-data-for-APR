## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function checks if the table name is in the stdout without considering the case of the characters. This leads to failed tests when the table name casing differs in the command output and the input.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the stdout case-insensitive. We should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

After applying these changes to the `table_exists` function, the case sensitivity issue should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass all the failing tests mentioned earlier.
