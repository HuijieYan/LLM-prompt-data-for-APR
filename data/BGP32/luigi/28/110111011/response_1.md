### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. The current implementation directly checks if the table name is in the output string without considering the case, leading to inconsistent test results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function should convert both the table name and the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This modification ensures a case-insensitive comparison, aligning with Hive's behavior.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase during comparison, the bug related to case sensitivity should be resolved. The corrected version aligns with the expected behavior of Hive when checking for table existence.
