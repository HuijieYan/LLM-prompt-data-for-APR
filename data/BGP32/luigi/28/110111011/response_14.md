To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make it case-insensitive when comparing the table name against the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests mentioned.
