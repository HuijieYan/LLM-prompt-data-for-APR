## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test due to case sensitivity issues specifically with table names.
2. The function is checking whether a table exists in a database by querying Hive. The issue arises when the table names are not case-insensitive matched resulting in failed tests.
3. The failing test cases are pointed out due to discrepancies in case sensitivity comparisons leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when checking for table existence, the table name is converted into lowercase for comparison.
5. By making the comparison case-insensitive, we can address the table existence check appropriately.

## Revised Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table` parameter is converted to lowercase for comparison to ensure case insensitivity.
- The `stdout` is split into lines and each line is converted into lowercase for comparison.
- The function returns true if `stdout` has any content, otherwise false, and follows case-insensitive checks.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence.
