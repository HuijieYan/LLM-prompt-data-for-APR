### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test cases

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check whether a table exists in a database. The function has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures.

In the failing test cases:
1. For case 1, the function should return `False` since the table 'mytable' is not in the output 'OK'.
2. For case 2, the function should return `True` since 'mytable' is found in the output 'OK\nmytable'.
3. For case 3, the function should return `True` since 'mytable' is found in the output 'OK'.
4. For case 4, the function should return `True` since 'mytable' is found in the output 'OK\nmytable'.

All failing test cases stem from the function not handling case sensitivity correctly.

### Cause of the bug

The bug lies in how the function compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case insensitive, the comparison should be done in a case-insensitive manner.

The GitHub issue indicated by `#896` correctly identifies the problem and proposes a solution by checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase version of the output.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output, making the comparison case-insensitive.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase version of the table name and the output, the function now handles case sensitivity correctly.

After applying this fix, the failing test cases should pass, and the issue regarding case sensitivity in the table existence check should be resolved.
