The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name provided as input with the table names fetched from the stdout of the `hive` command. 

To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the names fetched from the stdout are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation of changes:
- Adjusted the return statement to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the names in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
- Used `map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))` to ensure all table names fetched from stdout are converted to lowercase.
- This change ensures that the comparison is not affected by case differences and resolves the issue with table name case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to the case insensitivity problem.
