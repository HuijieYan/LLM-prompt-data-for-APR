### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` uses a conditional to check if a table exists in a Hive database based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The issue is related to case-sensitivity when comparing the table names. It fails to handle case differences between the table name and the output from Hive.
3. The failing tests demonstrate that when the table names are in different cases, the equality check fails, leading to assertions issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive to accurately determine table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the buggy function to convert both the table name (`table`) and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This ensures case-insensitive match.
2. Update the function to return `True` if the table name is found in the lowercase output, else `False`.
3. With this change, the function should correctly determine the existence of a table irrespective of case differences, resolving the failing test case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the table names lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function, the bug is fixed. The function now returns `True` if the lowercase table name is found in the lowercase output, ensuring case-insensitive table existence checking.
