## Fixed Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Explanation:
1. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in stdout with the actual table name provided. To fix this bug, we need to convert both names to lowercase before comparison.
2. By converting both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, allowing the function to correctly identify the table's existence.
3. The bug was causing test failures when comparing table names with different cases. By adjusting the comparison to be case insensitive, we can address the issue reported on GitHub related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that both the `table` name and `stdout` string are converted to lowercase before comparison. This approach aligns with the suggestions made in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
5. The corrected version of the function includes converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies table existence regardless of the case of the table name.
