The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures when checking table existence. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison. This change aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue #896.

By implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests, resolving the case sensitivity issue reported on GitHub.
