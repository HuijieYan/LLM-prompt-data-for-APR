### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table names.
2. The issue is related to the comparison between the table name provided as input and the table names retrieved from the `stdout` results of the Hive commands.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not performing a case-insensitive comparison between the table names.
4. To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the table names from the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` results to lowercase before comparison, the function will now perform case-insensitive checks for table existence, resolving the failing test cases.
