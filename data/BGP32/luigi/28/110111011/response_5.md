## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output retrieved from Hive. The function does not ensure that the table name from the Hive output matches the provided table name, leading to failures in case-sensitive environments.

### Error Cause
In the failing test cases, when the actual table name in Hive output is different in case (e.g., `MyTable` vs. `mytable`), the function fails to correctly match them and returns incorrect results. This results in the `assertTrue` assertion failures.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name provided and the table names retrieved from Hive output. By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, the function will be able to accurately determine the existence of a table, irrespective of case differences.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the return statement to compare the lowercase versions of the table names, the function will now accurately determine the existence of tables in a case-insensitive manner. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
