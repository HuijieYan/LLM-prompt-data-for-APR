To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output case insensitive. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the tables listed in the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive, which aligns with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue #896. This fix should make the `table_exists` function behave as expected and pass the failing tests.
