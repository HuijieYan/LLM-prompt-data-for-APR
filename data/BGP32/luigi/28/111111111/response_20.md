To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names extracted from stdout with the provided table name. The code currently checks for an exact match, leading to failures when table names are in different cases. By converting both the extracted table name from stdout and the provided table name to lowercase before comparison, we can make the comparison case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We convert both `table` and the table names extracted from `stdout` to lowercase using `lower()` before comparing them.
2. Instead of explicitly checking for `stdout`, we use `bool(stdout)` to check if it contains any output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub issue and the corresponding fix request.
