To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by comparing the lowercase versions of the table names. This will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case in which the table name is provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})")
            return bool(stdout)

```

By comparing `table.lower()` to `stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the table names are matched in a case-insensitive manner.

This correction should resolve the failing test cases, and the function will now behave as expected according to the provided runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values.
