To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity when comparing the table names from the stdout of the Hive command. We should convert both the `table` variable and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided, and it addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding the case sensitivity of table names in the `table_exists` function.
