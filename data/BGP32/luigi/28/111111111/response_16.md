To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

This correction should address the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive in the context of Hive table names.
