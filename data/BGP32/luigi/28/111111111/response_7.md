Based on the analysis provided, the bug stems from the case sensitivity of table names in the `table_exists` function. The function currently compares the table name directly with the output from the hive command, which causes failures when the case of the table name doesn't match the output.

To fix this bug and make the function case insensitive, we should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout is not None and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing tests as expected.
