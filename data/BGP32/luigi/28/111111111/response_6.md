To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name compared to the output from `run_hive_cmd`. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
            use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)
            """ % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for comparison, we ensure that the table name and output are both converted to lowercase before performing the equality check. This makes the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the issue outlined in the failing test cases.

With this correction, the function should now pass all the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values provided. The updated function ensures that regardless of the case of the table name, the function correctly determines if the table exists in the given database.

This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896, which aims to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to accommodate the behavior of Hive being case-insensitive with table names.
