I have analyzed the buggy function, the failing tests, the expected values, and the GitHub issues related to this bug. The issue stems from the case sensitivity of the table names in the `table_exists` function. The table names are compared directly without considering case, leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. We will convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This correction ensures that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner. By converting both the table name and the output to lower case, we eliminate the case sensitivity issue and allow the function to pass the failing tests.
