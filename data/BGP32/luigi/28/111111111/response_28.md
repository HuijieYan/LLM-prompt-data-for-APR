To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the database. This involves converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison. By doing this, we ensure that the function is not affected by the case sensitivity of the table names in Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s PARTITION
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function will work correctly with case-insensitive table names in Hive. This change aligns with the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the failing tests that check for case sensitivity in table names.
