Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity problem when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive commands. The function fails to correctly identify table existence due to case mismatch between the table name and the output from the Hive command.

To address this issue and make the function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic between the table name and the stdout obtained from Hive commands. We should convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case for a more reliable comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

The key change in the corrected version is converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before performing the comparison. This modification ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

By applying this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and correctly identify table existence regardless of the case sensitivity of the table names. Additionally, this fix aligns with the GitHub issue #896 raised to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
