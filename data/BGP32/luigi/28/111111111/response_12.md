After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is clear that the issue is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The current implementation is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when checking for tables with different text casing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase. This change will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the function will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing test cases related to case sensitivity issues.

This corrected version will align with the suggested fix in GitHub issue #896, where the table existence check is made case insensitive to avoid issues with different text casing.
