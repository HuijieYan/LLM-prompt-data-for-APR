To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before matching. This will align the comparison with the case insensitivity of Hive with table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now converts both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive as required.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue that requests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive for table name comparisons.
