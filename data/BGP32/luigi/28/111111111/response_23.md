To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. The current implementation checks for an exact match between the table name and the stdout, leading to failures when there are case differences. By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure a case-insensitive check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check, resolving the test failures related to case differences.

This fix addresses the issue raised in GitHub regarding the need for the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. It aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue and will ensure successful comparisons regardless of the case used in the table names.
