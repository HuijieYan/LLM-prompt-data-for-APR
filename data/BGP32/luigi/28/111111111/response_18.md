To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the `hive` command is case-insensitive by converting both to the same case before comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and the output `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table. This correction aligns with the GitHub issue raised regarding making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined in the analysis.
