The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from Hive output (stdout) with the input table parameter. The comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail when the table names do not match exactly due to case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name from the input parameter and the table name extracted from stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the table names extracted from stdout to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, which will make the function work correctly in all cases.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values as described. It also addresses the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
