To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the table names obtained from the stdout is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` name and the names obtained from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we make the check case insensitive, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.

This correction ensures that the function passes the failing tests and behaves as expected, being insensitive to the case of the table names.
