To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables in the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the tests pass correctly.

Make sure to update the function in its corresponding file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` and run the failing tests to verify that the issue has been resolved.
