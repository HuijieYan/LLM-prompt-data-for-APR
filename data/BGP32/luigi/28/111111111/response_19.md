To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to be case insensitive. Currently, the function checks if the exact table name exists in the output, leading to failures when the case of the table name does not match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This adjustment ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported in the failing tests.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
