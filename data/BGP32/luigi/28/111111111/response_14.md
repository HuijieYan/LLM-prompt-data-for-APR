Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the failing test cases, and the expected input/output values, it is evident that the bug stems from the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function. The function compares the exact table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to failures due to case differences.

To fix this bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to consider case insensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing, the function will now correctly handle case insensitive comparisons and pass the failing tests.

This correction resolves the issue reported in GitHub and aligns the function behavior with the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
