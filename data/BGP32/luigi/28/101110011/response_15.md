## Analysis:
1. The problematic function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence in the database using Hive queries.
2. The failing test cases clearly show that the function is not returning the correct result when dealing with case differences.
3. The test cases expect a table with a different case (capitalization) to be considered as existing in the database, which the current implementation fails to handle.
4. The GitHub issues suggest making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive queries to lowercase for comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive queries.
- Update the function to handle case sensitivity correctly, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making these modifications, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
