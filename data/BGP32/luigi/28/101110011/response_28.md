### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` provides a scenario where the function fails to correctly evaluate the table existence check due to case mismatch.
3. The error message states that `AssertionError: False is not true` occurred in the failing test case.
4. The GitHub issue raised about the bug highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address these issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not handling table names with varying cases correctly. It does not perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence in Hive, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison, we can ensure that case differences do not affect the results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function as shown above, we ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase for comparisons, making the function case insensitive. This corrected version should resolve the issue raised in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
