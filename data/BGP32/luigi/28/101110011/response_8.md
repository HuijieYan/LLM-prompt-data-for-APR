## Correction

After analyzing the provided buggy function, related test code, error messages, and GitHub issues, the bug in the `table_exists` function is identified as a case sensitivity problem. The function does not compare the table name case insensitively, leading to failing tests when uppercase table names are used.

To fix this bug, the `table_exists` function should compare the table name against the stdout in a case-insensitive manner by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Comparing case insensitively
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons when checking for the existence of tables.

This correction will resolve the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issues #896 and #903.
