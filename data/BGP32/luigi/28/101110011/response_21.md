## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and its related test functions along with the provided error messages and GitHub issues, it is clear that the bug exists due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name to the output from Hive. The table names in Hive are returned in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail in case-sensitive comparisons.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, resolving the bug reported in the failing test cases and GitHub issues related to case sensitivity.

This corrected version will pass the failing test cases and address the reported bug effectively.
