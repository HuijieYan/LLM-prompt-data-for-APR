## Corrections

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The function is not considering case variations, which leads to failing tests. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that Hive table names are case-insensitive, but the function is not handling this scenario correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Converted the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using `lower()` method before comparison.
2. Simplified the return statement using `bool(stdout)` to check if `stdout` is not empty.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
