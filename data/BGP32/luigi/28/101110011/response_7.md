The bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the output of Hive against the provided table name. The issue is caused by not considering case insensitivity in table name matching, which leads to failing test cases where the table name has different case formats.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the comparison of the table names, ensuring that it is not case sensitive.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))

        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue as reported in the GitHub issues.
