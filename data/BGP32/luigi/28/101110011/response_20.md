## Correction:

The problem with the buggy function `table_exists` is that it does a simple string matching to check if the table existence response from Hive matches the given table name. However, since Hive is case-insensitive, this method of comparison can lead to failures when comparing different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive. One way to do this is to convert both the table name and the Hive response to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the updated and corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version converts both the `table` name and the `stdout` response from Hive to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison.

After applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
