Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is expecting an exact match, but due to case differences, the comparison fails in some cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method for case-insensitive comparison.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now handle case sensitivity correctly, fixing the bug reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issues.
