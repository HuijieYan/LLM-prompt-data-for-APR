## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in a database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` is mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function and checking the behavior of `table_exists` with various scenarios, including different input cases.
3. The error occurs when comparing the table existence result in the test, leading to a false assertion due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. This change should help resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison in the `table_exists` function to use a case-insensitive check when verifying the table existence.
2. Convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in the database. This change should help pass the failing test and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub thread.
