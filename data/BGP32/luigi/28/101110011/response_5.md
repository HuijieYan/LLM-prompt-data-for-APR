## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is responsible for checking if a given table exists for the specified database with an optional partition.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the current implementation is case sensitive and should be made case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive.
3. The failing test cases show that the function is failing when checking tables with different cases due to case sensitivity.
4. The bug lies in the fact that the function is directly comparing the table name against the returned output without considering the case of the names.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function `table_exists` is directly comparing the provided table name against the output from `run_hive_cmd` without considering the case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail when the cases do not match, as seen in the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` to be case insensitive. This way, the function will correctly identify if the table exists regardless of the case used.

## Corrected Version
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now compares the lowercase versions of the table names to ensure a case-insensitive check. This modification aligns with the desired behavior outlined in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug causing the failing test cases.
