### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a Hive database. However, it has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity correctly.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` demonstrates the issue by failing when checking for a table with different cases than the expected output.
3. The error message indicates an assertion failure when testing for the presence of a table with a different case.
4. The related GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make `table_exists` function case insensitive to match Hive's behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the direct comparison between the `table` name and the output received from Hive commands, which may not match due to case differences.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the `table` name should be converted to lowercase before comparison with the Hive output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that both the `table` name and the Hive output are converted to lowercase for comparison, making the function case insensitive.

By implementing this change, the function should now pass the failing test cases and address the case insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
