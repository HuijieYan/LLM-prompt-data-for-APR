## Bug Analysis

The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class defined in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`. The function is failing the test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`.

The issue arises when checking for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner, leading to failures in case such as `self.assertTrue(returned)` where a table with a different case is being checked.

Additionally, the GitHub issue reveals that the function should be case insensitive and match the table name in a case-insensitive manner against the stdout.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Lowercase the table name before checking against the stdout to ensure a case-insensitive match.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to lowercase the table name before comparing.
3. Modify the function to return `stdout.lower()` to ensure the case-insensitive comparison.
4. Update the test function to include further checks for case insensitivity.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

After updating the function as shown above, it should pass the failing test cases and the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This change makes the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, resolving the inaccuracies in the comparison.
