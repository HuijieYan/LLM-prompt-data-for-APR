## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the related test code, the issue arises from the `table_exists` function not handling the case sensitivity of table names. The function does not account for the fact that Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing the tests to fail when expecting uppercase table names.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This modification ensures the function is case insensitive, resolving the failing tests and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.

After applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and be case insensitive as expected.
