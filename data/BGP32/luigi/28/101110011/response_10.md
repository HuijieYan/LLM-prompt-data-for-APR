## Correction:

The main issue with the buggy `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case insensitivity when checking the existence of a table in Hive. The function directly compares the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`, which can cause failures due to case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we convert the table name to lowercase using `table_lower = table.lower()`. We then compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd` to handle case insensitivity correctly.

This modification should address the case sensitivity issue present in the buggy function and make the `table_exists` function work as expected in the test cases provided.
