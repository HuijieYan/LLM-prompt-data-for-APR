## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the provided source code, test, error message, and GitHub issues, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name against the output. To fix this issue, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive and will return the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, the function will now correctly handle case insensitivity and return the expected results.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to case sensitivity.
