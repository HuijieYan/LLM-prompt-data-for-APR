#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database but does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
2. The failing test `test_apacheclient_table_exists` tries to verify that the `table_exists` function works as expected, but due to the case sensitivity issue, it fails.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion for `assertTrue` is failing because of a case mismatch between the table name and the output from the Hive command.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle different cases of table names correctly.
  
#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function to check if the lowercased table name exists in the lowercased output from the command.
3. Apply the suggestions from the GitHub issue (#896) to make the function case insensitive.

#### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
