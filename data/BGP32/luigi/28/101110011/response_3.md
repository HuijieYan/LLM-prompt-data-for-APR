### Analyzing the buggy function and related information
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue with case sensitivity in checking table existence.
2. The related function `run_hive_cmd` is called within the `table_exists` function to run Hive commands.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` provides inputs to the `table_exists` function and checks the output.
4. The error message indicates an assertion failure due to case sensitivity issues.
5. Two GitHub issues (#896 and #897) discuss the case insensitivity problem and propose a solution.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` might lead to case sensitivity problems.
2. The comparison might not be handling cases where table names are capitalized differently in Hive output.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the comparison between the expected `table` name and the actual `stdout` output is case-sensitive. Since Hive is not case-sensitive when checking table names, the test cases fail due to differences in capitalization of table names. The test cases do not account for case insensitivity, leading to failed assertions.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function:
1. Convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it case-insensitive.
2. Update the function to handle case-insensitive comparisons between the expected table name and the output from Hive commands.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
                        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With the corrected version above, the `table_exists` function now converts both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.

By updating the function to handle case insensitivity properly, the test cases should pass without assertion errors, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
