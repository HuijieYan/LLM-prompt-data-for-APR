### Analyzing the Buggy Function
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a Hive database. The function queries Hive using the `run_hive_cmd` function, passing in the database, table name, and possibly a partition specification.

The failing test `test_table_exists` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function to return specific values and then checks the behavior of the `table_exists` function. The failing assertion occurs when testing case insensitivity for table names.

The GitHub issue highlights the need for `table_exists` to be case insensitive due to Hive being case insensitive in table name resolution.

### Identifying the Bug
The bug lies in how the `table_exists` function compares the table name from the query output with the provided table name. It does not consider case insensitivity, leading to failing assertions in the test cases for different table name cases.

### Bug Cause
The `table_exists` function compares the actual table names retrieved from Hive against the provided table name without considering case sensitivity. This approach leads to false negatives when the cases do not match, causing the failing tests and assertions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table names case insensitive. By converting both the actual and provided table names to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the provided table name `table` and the retrieved table names from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.

By making this change, the `table_exists` function should now be case insensitive, as intended by the GitHub issue and the failing test cases.
