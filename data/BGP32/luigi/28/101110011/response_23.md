## Correction

The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. The function is comparing the `table` name directly with the output from the Hive command, which is case sensitive. To fix this, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` name and the output to lowercase before comparing.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the `table` name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
