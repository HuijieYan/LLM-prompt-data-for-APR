## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in Hive with a given database and optional partition.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity, where the table name is not being matched correctly due to case differences.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` are checking for case sensitivity issues, causing the test to fail with an `AssertionError`.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address this problem.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function is failing due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive query. Hive is case insensitive, so table names may be returned in lowercase. However, the function compares the table name as-is without considering case differences, leading to test failures.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive query is performed case insensitively. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
