The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from the hive command with the actual table name provided as input. The buggy function does a direct comparison, leading to test failures when table names are not in the same case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the extracted table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.strip, stdout.lower().split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the extracted table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases related to case sensitivity issues.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive to ensure correct behavior.
