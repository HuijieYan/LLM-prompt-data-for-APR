The cause of the bug in the function `table_exists` is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Due to Hive being case-insensitive, this can lead to assertion failures in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase version of the table name and stdout received from `run_hive_cmd`, we ensure a case-insensitive check. This correction will address the failing test cases and align with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896.

Feel free to test this corrected version to confirm the resolution of the bug.
