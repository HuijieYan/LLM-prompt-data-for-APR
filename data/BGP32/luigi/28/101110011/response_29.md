### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command to check for table existence.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the buggy function is not handling case insensitivity correctly when checking for table existence.
3. The failing test cases provide examples where the table names are in different cases compared to the expected output, leading to test failures.
4. The root cause of the bug is that the buggy function does a direct check on the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase.
2. Convert the stdout received from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.
3. Update the conditional checks in the function to compare lowercase values.
4. Add necessary comments to indicate case insensitivity handling.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### With this correction, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the output received from the Hive command. This change allows the function to pass the failing test cases related to case sensitivity issues. The fix aligns with the suggested strategy and resolves the GitHub issue regarding making `table_exists` case insensitive.
