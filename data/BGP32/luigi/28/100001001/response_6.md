### Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function checks if a table exists in a given database in Hive by running a command and checking the output. In Case 1 and Case 2, the function fails to correctly identify the existence of the table due to case-sensitive matching issues with the table name. In Case 3 and Case 4, the function fails to accurately determine the existence of the table due to the unexpected output format.

### Bug
The bug in the function lies in the equality check for the table name in the stdout. When comparing the table name from the output to the input table name, the function does not handle case-insensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name to be case-insensitive. Additionally, we should handle unexpected output formats by parsing them correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, we ensure case-insensitive comparison of table names by converting both names to lowercase. We also check all tables from the output in a case-insensitive manner using the `any` function. Additionally, we simplify the logic for determining the existence of a table within a partition without unnecessary conditions.
