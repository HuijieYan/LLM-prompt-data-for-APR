### Analysis:
- The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
- The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output.
- In the first case, it checks if the table exists without a partition, and in the second case, with a partition.
- The function returns a boolean value based on whether the table exists or not.

### Bugs:
1. The function appears to check for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` string to determine if the table exists. This approach is error-prone as the exact match may vary depending on the output format.
2. The `stdout` value is not properly parsed or handled to accurately determine the existence of the table.
3. The `stdout` check is not thorough and may return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bugs, we can implement a more robust method to check for the table's existence. One way to do this is to split the `stdout` string and explicitly search for the table name in the results. 

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version above:
- We split the `stdout` string when checking for the table name to avoid issues with exact matches.
- We return the result directly using `bool(stdout)` to handle any non-empty output as True and empty output as False.

This corrected version should provide a more reliable check for table existence in the Hive database.
