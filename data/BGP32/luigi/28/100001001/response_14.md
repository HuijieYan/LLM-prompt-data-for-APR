The bug in the buggy function is related to the comparison of the `table` name with the `stdout` output from the Hive command. The buggy function is expecting an exact match between the `table` name and the returned table names from the Hive command, which leads to incorrect results because the check is case-sensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the `table` name and the table names received from the Hive command output. We can achieve this by converting both strings to the same case (lower or upper) before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_lower = table.lower()
        
        return stdout and table_lower in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Checking if stdout is not empty

```

In the corrected version:
- We convert the `table` name to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function to make it case-insensitive.
- When checking the table names from the Hive command output, we split the string by whitespace to compare individual table names.
- We return `True` if `stdout` is not empty (indicating the table exists) or `False` otherwise.

This correction ensures that the function accurately checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database, irrespective of the case of the table name.
