### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and determine if the table exists based on the output. However, the comparison of the table existence status is not correctly handled in the function.

### Identified Issue:
The bug lies in the comparison of the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists. In the `if stdout` condition, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty to return `True`, which is logically incorrect since an empty string is a valid output in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions for checking the existence of the table. Instead of relying solely on the presence of `stdout`, we should explicitly check if the table name is present in the output to confirm its existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, the comparison for table existence is done by checking if the `stdout` output contains the exact table name (after stripping any whitespaces) in case of table existence.
- The `stdout` is directly converted to a boolean for partition existence as it just needs to confirm if the output is not empty.
- The corrected version now accurately determines the table's existence based on the `stdout` output.
