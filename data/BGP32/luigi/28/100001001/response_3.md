### Bug Analysis:

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it checks if the table exists in the database. In the first condition when `partition is None`, it uses the `show tables like "{1}"` command to check if the table exists. However, this method is case-sensitive, which can cause issues when comparing table names. In the second condition when `partition is not None`, it uses the `show partitions` command, which might not accurately determine if the table exists.

### Bug Fix:

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to make the table existence check case-insensitive and more reliable:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = [x.strip() for x in stdout.split('\n')]
        return table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in tables]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the code to retrieve all tables in the database and then comparing in a case-insensitive manner, we can ensure a more robust check for table existence. Additionally, the second condition simply checks if `stdout` has a value, making the function cleaner and more reliable.
