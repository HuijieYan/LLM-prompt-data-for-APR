### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table or partition exists in the specified database by running a Hive command. However, there are potential issues in the function logic:
1. In the `if partition is None` block, the function is checking if the table is in the output from the Hive command, which may not always work correctly due to case sensitivity.
2. In the `else` block, the function is using the `show partitions` command but not checking if the specific partition exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the mismatch in case sensitivity when checking for table existence, and the incomplete logic in handling partition existence.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to perform case-insensitive checks for table existence and properly handle partition existence checks. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        command = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(command)

        return "OK" in stdout

``` 

In this corrected version:
1. I have modified the command to use `show tables in {1}` for a case-insensitive check of table existence.
2. In the `else` block, I simplified the logic to check if the partition exists by returning `True` if "OK" is in the stdout.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly check for table and partition existence.
