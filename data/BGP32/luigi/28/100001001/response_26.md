### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. In the first case, when checking for the existence of the table "mytable" in the database "default", the function is incorrectly checking if the table name is an exact match with the `stdout`, which contains only "OK" in the first case. This logic issue causes the function to return `False` even though the table does exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` instead of requiring an exact match.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

In the corrected version, the `return` statement now checks if the `table` name is present in the `stdout` variable, allowing the function to correctly identify the table's existence.
