### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table or partition exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and parse the output to determine the existence of the specified table or partition.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function only checks if the table name is in the output directly, while in Case 2 and Case 4, the function needs to consider the case-sensitivity of the table name.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of the table names in the `stdout` with the specified table name. The function does not handle the case sensitivity of table names correctly, leading to incorrect results in Case 2 and Case 4 where the table name case does not match exactly.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names to consider case sensitivity. One way to achieve this is by converting both the specified table name and the table names in `stdout` to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the specified table name and the table names in the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check for table existence is case-insensitive. This fix should address the bug and provide correct results for all cases.
