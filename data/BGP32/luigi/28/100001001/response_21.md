### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function checks if the table name is in the stdout response directly without parsing it properly. This leads to incorrect results as it doesn't account for the formatting or case sensitivity.

2. In Case 2 and Case 4, even when the table exists, the function incorrectly determines that the table does not exist. This happens because the function does not properly handle the formatting of the table names in the stdout response.

### Bug Fix
To address the identified issues, we need to modify how the function processes the stdout response to accurately determine if the table exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables in {database} like "{table}";')

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});")

        return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made
1. Use `show tables in {database} like "{table}"` instead of `show tables like "{table}"` to specify the database explicitly.
2. Lowercase both the table name and the stdout response for case-insensitive comparison.
3. Split the stdout response on whitespace to handle multiple table names correctly.
4. Simplified the return statements to directly return the result of the conditions. 

By making these changes, we ensure that the function correctly identifies if a table exists in the specified database and handles variations in formatting and case sensitivity.
