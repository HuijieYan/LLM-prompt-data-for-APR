### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition for checking the table existence based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In both cases, the function checks if the `stdout` variable has a value, and if so, returns `True`, indicating that the table exists. However, the logic is flawed because in Case 2 and Case 4, even if the table name appears in the `stdout`, it may not mean that the table actually exists. The function is incorrectly assuming that the presence of the table name in the output means the table exists, which is not always the case.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to rely on a more concrete way to determine if the table exists. One way to do this is to parse the `stdout` result to specifically look for the exact match of the table name. Additionally, we should consider situations where the `stdout` might include other information unrelated to the table existence check.

### Updated Function
Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function with improved logic:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} "{2}"'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            return False
```

This updated version splits the `stdout` by whitespace and then checks if the table name is among the items in the split result. This provides a more robust check for the existence of the table.
