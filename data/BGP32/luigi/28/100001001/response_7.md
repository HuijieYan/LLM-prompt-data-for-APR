## Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison condition not being evaluated correctly. In the cases where the function checks if the table exists in the database, the comparison is not matching the expected outputs. This issue is due to the inconsistency in the table name case sensitivity, where the function is not handling the case of the table names correctly. 

Specifically, in Case 2 and Case 4, the table names have different casing in the input compared to the output from the Hive command. As a result, the equality check fails, leading to incorrect function behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the expected table name and the table names extracted from the Hive query output is case-insensitive. By converting both names to a consistent case (either lower or upper case) before comparison, we can make the function behavior consistent.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function converts both the expected table name and the names extracted from the Hive query output to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive comparison and fixing the bug.
