### Analysis
- The function `table_exists` is intended to check if a given table exists in a specified database in Hive.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking for the existence of the table using the `stdout` variable obtained from running a Hive command.
- The function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` after executing a Hive command, but the comparison might not be accurate leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
- In the buggy function, the comparison `return stdout and table in stdout` is used to determine if the table exists in the database. However, this comparison may not always work as intended due to the nature of the `stdout` output from the Hive command.
- In Case 2, for example, the `stdout` contains `'OK\nmytable'`, but the comparison `table in stdout` might not match `table` due to the case sensitivity of the comparison. As a result, the function may incorrectly report that the table does not exist.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the `stdout`. This can be achieved by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table = table.lower()
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the table existence in the `stdout`, addressing the bug in the function.
