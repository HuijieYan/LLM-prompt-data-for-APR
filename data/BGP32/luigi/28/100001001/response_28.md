### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. It checks for the existence of a table or partition and returns a boolean value based on the result. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the stdout output from the Hive commands.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may fail to accurately determine if the table exists due to mismatched case sensitivity.
2. The parsing of the `stdout` in the if-else blocks might not be handling the output correctly.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 2, the mismatch in case between the table name provided and the table name in the stdout leads to a false negative result.
2. In Case 4, a similar issue arises due to case sensitivity in the table names, leading to incorrect verification of the table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison checks are case-insensitive, and the parsing of the stdout reflects the expected format.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables_list = [t.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n')]

        return table.lower() in tables_list
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec))
        partitions_list = [p.lower() for p in stdout.split('\n') if p]

        return partition_spec.lower() in partitions_list
```

This corrected version converts all table and partition names to lowercase for comparison to ensure case-insensitive checks. Additionally, it splits the stdout by newline characters and processes each entry to create a list for comparison.
