### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table or partition exists in a database using Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of the table or partition in the output of the Hive command.

### Identified Issue:
1. The function checks if the `table` name is present in the `stdout` output, which can lead to incorrect results due to case-sensitive or additional whitespace issues.
2. The function does not account for different cases in the table name comparison, leading to potential mismatches.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Normalize the table names or outputs to eliminate case sensitivity issues.
2. Improve the comparison method to ensure accurate detection of the table/partition existence.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures that the table names are compared irrespective of case differences and additional whitespace. Now, the function should provide accurate results for checking the existence of tables or partitions in a database using Hive commands.
