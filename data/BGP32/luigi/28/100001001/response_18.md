### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the condition checks on the `stdout` variable. In both cases when checking if the `stdout` is valid (`stdout` is not an empty string) and when checking for the presence of the table/partition in the `stdout`, the logic is incorrect. The function does not properly handle the case when the table/partition is found in `stdout`, leading to incorrect return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function, we need to properly check the contents of `stdout` to determine if the table or partition exists. Additionally, we should handle different cases where the table/partition names might be present in the `stdout` to ensure correct results.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split() if stdout else False  # Check if the table is in the list of tables returned
    else:
        partition_cmd = f"""use {database}; show partitions {table} partition {self.partition_spec(partition)}"""
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(partition_cmd)
        return partition in stdout.split() if stdout else False  # Check if the partition is in the list of partitions returned
```

### Changes Made
1. Added splitting of the `stdout` string to create a list of tables/partitions.
2. Implemented proper checks to see if the specified table/partition exists in the list.
3. Adjusted the function to return `True` if the table/partition is found in the list, and `False` otherwise.
