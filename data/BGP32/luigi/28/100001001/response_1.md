### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and retrieve the output. The bug seems to stem from the way the function checks for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`.

### Error Locations:
1. In the first `if` statement, the function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output by using `table in stdout`. This may not work correctly if there are extraneous characters present in the `stdout`.
   
2. In the second `if` statement, the function checks if the `stdout` is not empty by evaluating `if stdout`. This may not accurately determine if the table exists if the output contains other information.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the way the function checks for the existence of the table in the command output. The `in` operator may not work as expected if there are additional characters or formatting in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the way the function checks for the table existence in the command output. It is better to parse the output and check for exact matches rather than using the `in` operator which might be influenced by formatting issues.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        cleaned_table_list = [t.strip() for t in table_list if t.strip()]
        
        return table in cleaned_table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version of the function splits the `stdout` by newlines and cleans any whitespace, ensuring that only table names are left. Then it directly checks if the `table` is in the list of cleaned table names. In the case of partitions, we simply return True if `stdout` is not empty.
