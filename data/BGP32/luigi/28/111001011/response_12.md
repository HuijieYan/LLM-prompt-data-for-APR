### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is not handling the case difference, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison of the table name with the stdout. The comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name and the stdout don't match.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name directly with the stdout without considering the case sensitivity of the two strings. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to accurately determine if the table exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before the comparison. This ensures that the function performs a case-insensitive check to accurately determine if the table exists in Hive.
