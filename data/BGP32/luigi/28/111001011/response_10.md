### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a database.
2. The bug arises when comparing the table name against the output from `hive`. The comparison is case-sensitive, causing issues with table names that may have different case configurations from what's expected in the comparison.
3. The `table_exists` function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a `hive` command, which returns output indicating the existence of the table. In the failing tests, the bug occurs due to a case mismatch in the table names.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output to be case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive and address the issue reported on GitHub.
