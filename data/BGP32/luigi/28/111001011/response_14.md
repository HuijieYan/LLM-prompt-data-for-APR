### Analyzing the buggy function

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the current implementation is case sensitive, causing failures when comparing table names due to Hive being case insensitive.

### Potential Error Locations

1. The comparison `table in stdout` inside the `if` statement.
2. The comparison of `stdout` with a specific value to determine if the table exists or not.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is related to the case sensitivity of comparing the table name in the `stdout` string. Since Hive is case insensitive, the `table_exists` function fails to correctly identify the existence of a table if the cases mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the `table` name and the table names in `stdout` case insensitive. One approach to achieve this is by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the bug discussed in the GitHub issue.
