### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for table existence in Hive and returns True if the table exists, otherwise False. The issue arises when the table name case does not match between the provided table name and the table name returned by Hive due to case insensitivity.
2. The buggy function compares the provided table name with the output from the Hive command to determine table existence.
3. The bug occurs because the comparison is done with exact case sensitivity, leading to false negatives when the case of the table name does not match the case returned by Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.
5. Updated the comparison to convert both table names to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase for comparison, the corrected version addresses the issue highlighted in the GitHub report and ensures that the table existence check is case-insensitive.
