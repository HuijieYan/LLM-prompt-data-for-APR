### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a specified database, with the option to check for a specific partition. The issue arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the Hive database.
2. The bug is due to case sensitivity in comparing the table names in the Hive database, causing the function to fail when the table names have different cases.
3. The bug is related to a known GitHub issue where the function should be made case insensitive to account for differences in case when checking for table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the table name with the names returned from Hive in a case-insensitive manner.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
