### Analysis:
1. The buggy `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks the output to determine if the table exists.
2. The bug arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from Hive commands. The function does not account for the case difference, leading to incorrect results.
3. In the provided runtime cases, it can be seen that the function compares the table names directly without normalizing the case. This causes mismatches in the comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase or uppercase for consistent checking.
5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase during comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
