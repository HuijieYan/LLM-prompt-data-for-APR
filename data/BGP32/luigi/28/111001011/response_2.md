### Analysis of the Bug

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database.
2. The bug arises from the case sensitivity issue where the function is not handling case-insensitive comparisons correctly.
3. The GitHub issue highlights this problem by pointing out that when checking for existing tables with mixed cases, the comparisons fail due to case sensitivity.
4. The strategy to fix this bug involves converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to a consistent case (lowercase) for comparison.

### Updated Buggy Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation of Changes
- Changed the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
- This change ensures that the table names are compared irrespective of case sensitivity, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
- By making the comparison case insensitive, the function can accurately determine if a table exists in the database regardless of the case used.

By implementing these modifications, the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class should now be case insensitive, resolving the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
