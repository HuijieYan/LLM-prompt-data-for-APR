### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, it currently does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem, as Hive returns table names in lowercase, potentially causing test failures for tables defined with different case conventions.
3. The bug is introduced due to the direct string comparison in the `table_exists` function without considering case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive, the `table` parameter needs to be converted to lowercase before comparing it to the output string in `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the code to convert the `table` parameter to lowercase before comparing it to the output from Hive.
2. Return `True` if the lowercase `table` is found in the lowercase `stdout`, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` parameter is converted to lowercase before the comparison with the output `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue. This modification addresses the reported bug and aligns with the expected behavior.
