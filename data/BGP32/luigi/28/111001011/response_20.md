### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in a database using Hive commands.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity issues where the function does not handle the case of the table name properly.
3. The issue description on GitHub highlights that tables can have different cases (like 'FooBar') which Hive will return in lowercase. This leads to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity by converting the table name to lowercase before checking in the stdout.
5. We will modify the buggy function to handle case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Convert the input `table` name to lowercase before checking in the `stdout`.
- Modify the conditional checks to compare lowercase strings for case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        table_lower = table.lower()
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
            return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table_lower, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
``` 

By converting the `table` name to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database.
