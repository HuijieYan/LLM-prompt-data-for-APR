### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when there are case sensitivity problems with table names. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to run Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists.

The problem lies in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. If the table name and the output have different cases, the comparison will fail.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function's issue comes from the case sensitivity in comparing the table name and the output from Hive commands. When the table name is in a different case than the output, the comparison fails even if the table exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This strategy will ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the case used.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` values are converted to lowercase for comparison, addressing the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies if the specified table exists in the Hive database.
