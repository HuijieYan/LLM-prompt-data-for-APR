### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` with the given table name. The function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison, leading to test failures when dealing with table names that differ only in case.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` or `self.partition_spec(partition)` does not take case sensitivity into account.
2. For some outputs in Hive, the table names are returned in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `table_exists` directly compares the provided table name with the table names extracted from the Hive output without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives in cases where the table names differ only in case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the provided table name and the table names extracted from the Hive output to a common case (either lowercase or uppercase) before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the provided table name `table` and the names extracted from the Hive output are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and implements a more robust comparison method for table existence checks.
