### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue arises when the function compares the table name against the output of the Hive command, which may return table names in lowercase. This leads to failing tests when a table with differently cased names is checked for existence.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation of the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison between the table name provided and the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to incorrectly evaluate the existence of tables, especially when the table names differ in case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we should modify the comparison logic to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase for comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This aligns with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub issue.
