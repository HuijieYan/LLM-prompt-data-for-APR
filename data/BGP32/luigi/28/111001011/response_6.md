### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, as described in the GitHub issue, there is a case sensitivity problem where the function compares the table names in a case-sensitive manner. This leads to test failures when the table names are not in the exact case as expected.

### Identified Bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive, causing failures when the cases do not match exactly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the `table` parameter with the output from Hive (stdout) without considering case sensitivity. This results in mismatches when the case of the table names does not match exactly with the output from Hive.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to convert both the `table` parameter and the output from Hive to a consistent case (either lowercase or uppercase) before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case sensitivity.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- The `table` parameter and the output from Hive (stdout) are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- The comparison is now case insensitive, ensuring that the function can correctly determine if a table exists in the Hive database irrespective of the case of the table names.
