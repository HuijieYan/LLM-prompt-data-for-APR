### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the case sensitivity problem where the function fails for tables with different cases (uppercase/lowercase).
2. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output obtained from Hive, which may not match due to case differences.
3. The function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive to ensure a case-insensitive check.
4. To fix the bug, modify the comparison in the return statement to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase output from Hive.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, the comparison is made between the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive to ensure a case-insensitive check. This modification addresses the GitHub issue and fixes the bug.
