### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for table existence in Hive, but due to case sensitivity issues, it fails when the table names have different cases.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command, as the table name is not normalized to lowercase before comparison.
3. The bug is highlighted by the GitHub issue, where it is suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from Hive.
4. **Strategy to fix the bug:** Normalize the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the fixed version, the `table.lower()` is used to normalize the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive, which also has been lowercase. This change makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive as suggested in the GitHub issue.
