### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence in Hive by running a Hive command and parsing the output.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and capture the output.
3. The bug originates from a case sensitivity issue where the function is checking for exact table name matches without considering case sensitivity, causing tests to fail.
4. The bug is related to GitHub issues indicating the need for case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function checking for an exact match of the table name in the Hive output without considering case sensitivity. This causes failures when the table names have different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert both to lowercase for case insensitivity
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring case insensitivity. This fix addresses the bug related to table existence checks in Hive with varying case sensitivity.
