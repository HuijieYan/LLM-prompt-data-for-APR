### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` helper function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. However, the bug in the function causes the comparisons to fail due to case sensitivity issues.

### Identifying the Bug

The bug lies in the comparisons made within the function. When checking if a table exists, the function compares the table name directly with the output received from running Hive commands. This direct string match may fail if there are case differences between the table name and the retrieved output.

### Cause of the Bug

The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparisons in the function. Hive is case-insensitive, so table names may be returned in lowercase even if they were defined with mixed cases or uppercase in the input. This discrepancy leads to the comparisons failing and incorrectly determining that the table does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the comparisons should be made in a case-insensitive manner. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This adjustment will align the comparison with the case-insensitive nature of Hive.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- Both the `table` and `stdout` variables are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison to ensure a case-insensitive check.
- The function now returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty (indicating that the table exists) and the lowercase `table` name is found within the lowercase `stdout`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This adjustment aligns the function's behavior with the case-insensitive nature of Hive and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
