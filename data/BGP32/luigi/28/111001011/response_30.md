### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case-insensitive when checking table existence as Hive is case-insensitive.
3. The bug lies in the fact that the function doesn't handle case sensitivity properly when comparing table names from the Hive output.
4. The function currently compares the table name directly with the output, leading to case mismatch issues as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name with the stdout from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false negatives when checking for table existence if there is a case mismatch between the input table name and the Hive output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase (or uppercase) for a consistent case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using `lower()` for a case-insensitive comparison.
- The function now correctly checks for table existence regardless of the case of the table name in the Hive output.
- The return statement for the case when `stdout` is not empty is simplified to `return bool(stdout)` for clarity.
