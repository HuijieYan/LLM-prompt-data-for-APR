### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.

2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when checking the table existence. The function compares the provided table name with the output of the Hive command, which may be in a different case.

3. The bug arises when the case of the table name provided and the one returned by Hive command stdout doesn't match, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the stdout table names to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the retrieved table names from Hive command output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
