### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not consider case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the `table` name directly with the `stdout` received from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences, leading to test failures in scenarios where the table casing does not match exactly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command without handling case sensitivity. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub issue where it was suggested to check against the lowercase version of the table name to prevent case-related failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This way, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and works correctly with tables that might have different casings.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing, this corrected version of the function ensures that the check for table existence is case insensitive, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
