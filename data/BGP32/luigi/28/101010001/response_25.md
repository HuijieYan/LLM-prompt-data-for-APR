### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommand` client class is supposed to check whether a table exists in the specified database with or without a partition. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks the output to determine if the table exists or not.

In the failing test cases, the `run_hive_cmd` mock object is returning the string "OK" in the first case and "OK\nmytable" in subsequent cases. The function is not correctly handling this output and is failing the assertions.

### Bug Location:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is causing incorrect handling of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the existence of the table by inspecting the stdout of the Hive commands, but it doesn't handle variations in the output format correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the way the function checks the stdout of the command execution. The function only checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout and assumes that it indicates existence. However, in the failing test cases, additional text is present in the stdout ("OK\nmytable"), causing the function to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the stdout variations. We should check if the table name is present as a separate token in the stdout, instead of just string matching. Splitting the stdout and checking for individual tokens would make the function more robust and capable of handling different patterns in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
    
            return any(partition_spec in out for out in stdout.split('\n'))

``` 

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function addresses the bug by splitting the stdout and checking individual tokens for table or partition information. This modification ensures that the function handles various output patterns and correctly determines the existence of the table.
