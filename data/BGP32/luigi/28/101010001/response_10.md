1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The error message is indicating that the test cases are failing because the function is not returning the expected results.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function include:
   - The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` in the `if` block. It might not correctly check whether the table exists.
   - The formatting of the command in the `else` block might be incorrect, leading to incorrect checks for table existence.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect checks for the presence of the table in the returned output from the hive commands. The function might not properly handle the available output to identify whether the table exists or not.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure:
   - Correct parsing of the output from the hive commands to accurately determine if the table exists.
   - Proper formatting of the Hive commands being executed.
   - Handle cases where the table name might be case-sensitive.

5. Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_cmd = "(%s)" % self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use %s; show partitions %s %s;' % (database, table, partition_cmd))

            return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- Replaced `show tables like` with `show tables in` to accurately list the tables in a database.
- Corrected the formatting of the command to show partitions in a table with a specific partition.
- Checked for the presence of the table in the stdout output to ensure accurate results.
