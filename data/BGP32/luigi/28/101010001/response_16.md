1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands. The failing tests indicate that the function is not behaving as expected, returning `False` when it should return `True`.

2. Potential error locations within the `table_exists` function:
   - The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might not be handling the output from `run_hive_cmd` correctly.
   - The formatting of the Hive command in the `else` block might be incorrect.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug seems to be caused by how the function is checking the output from `run_hive_cmd`. The logic for checking if the table exists is not correctly evaluating the output from the Hive command.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in both conditions of `table_exists` and ensure that the table name is properly extracted from the output.
   - Verify the correctness of the Hive command being executed in the `else` block.

5. Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(key, value) for key, value in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show partitions {}.{} partition({});'.format(database, database, table, partition_str))
            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- Extracted table existence check logic and simplified the return statements for clarity.
- Used `if else` condition for returning `True` or `False` based on the output of Hive commands.
- Ensured correct handling and formatting of partition specification in the `else` block.
