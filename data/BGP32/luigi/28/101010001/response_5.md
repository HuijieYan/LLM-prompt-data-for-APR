### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is calling the function `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
2. The function is failing because the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is not being checked properly to determine if the table exists.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd` in the `table_exists` function. The function is not correctly checking if the table is present in the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly check the output for the presence of the table name.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to properly parse the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.
2. Return `True` if the table name is found in the output, otherwise return `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

By updating the `table_exists` function to properly check if the table name exists in the output from `run_hive_cmd`, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
