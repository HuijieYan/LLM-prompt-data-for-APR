1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class that inherits from `HiveClient`.
   - The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
   - The failing test case is checking whether the table exists by running a command and checking the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

2. Potential Error Location:
   - The bug might be in how the function processes the output from `run_hive_cmd` when checking for table existence without a partition and with a partition.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug seems to be related to how the function checks the result from `run_hive_cmd` for table existence. The function may not properly handle the case when the table is found in the output.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Update the conditional statements in the `table_exists` function to properly check for the presence of the table in the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])  # Handle partition data
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return stdout is not None and stdout.strip() != ""
```

This corrected version of the function handles both cases (with and without partitions) more appropriately by parsing the partition data when necessary and checking the output from `run_hive_cmd` for empty or non-empty string to determine the existence of the table.
