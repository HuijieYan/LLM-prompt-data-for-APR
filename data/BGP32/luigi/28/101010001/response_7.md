### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists by running a Hive command.
- The function uses `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute the Hive commands.
- The function expects to receive output that contains the table name in order to determine if the table exists.
- The failing tests indicate that the function is returning incorrect results when checking for table existence.

### Potential Error Location:
- The bug could be in the condition where the function checks if the table name is present in the output received from the Hive command.
- There might be an issue with how the function constructs and executes the Hive commands.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug appears to be related to how the function processes and validates the output from the Hive command run using `run_hive_cmd`.
- The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is likely incorrectly evaluating the presence of the table name in the stdout.
- The function may not be handling the Hive command output correctly when checking for the existence of a table.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Check the output of the Hive command returned from `run_hive_cmd` to ensure it is correctly capturing the necessary information.
- Verify if the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` accurately represents the existence of the table in the output.
- Ensure that the function properly parses the returned output from the Hive commands to determine table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table in [t.strip() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip()]
        
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
- Updated the Hive command in the first condition to use `show tables in database` instead of `show tables like` to ensure accurate results.
- Modified the check for table existence to split and strip each line of the output and then check if the table is present.
- Returned a boolean value based on the presence of output in the second condition to determine table existence.

### Result:
- The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and accurately determine the existence of a table in the Hive database.
