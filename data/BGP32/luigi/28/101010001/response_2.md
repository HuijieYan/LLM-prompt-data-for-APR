### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly checking whether a table exists in Hive. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command, but the logic for processing the output and determining whether the table exists is flawed. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to test failures due to assertions not matching the expected outcomes.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Logic for parsing the output of `run_hive_cmd` to determine table existence.
2. Use of the `stdout` variable to check if the table exists.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the conditional checks after running the Hive command. In the case where a table is found, the function doesn't correctly parse the output to determine the existence of the table. The faulty logic in the if-else statements leads to incorrect return values, causing the tests to fail when they expect the table to exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic for parsing the output of `run_hive_cmd` to accurately determine the existence of the table.
2. Ensure that the return values in all scenarios (table exists and doesn't exist) are handled correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` by '\n' and checking if the table name is present in the list of tables, we can accurately determine whether the table exists or not. Additionally, we handle the return value as a boolean to signify the existence of the table.
