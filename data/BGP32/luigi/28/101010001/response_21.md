## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a specified table exists in a given database and partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries and checks the output to determine if the table exists.
3. The error occurs when the function incorrectly checks the output from `run_hive_cmd` against the existence of the table, leading to failing assertions in the tests.

## Identified Bug:
The bug arises in the `table_exists` function's logic when checking the stdout from `run_hive_cmd`. In the case of having just the table name in the output, the function fails to correctly determine the existence of the table.

## Bug Cause:
In the `table_exists` function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` for checking the existence of the table is incorrect. When the table name exists in the `stdout`, it shouldn't return `stdout`, but instead, `return True`. This mistake leads to failing assertions in the tests.

## Suggested Fix:
Modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and return `True` when the table is found in the output.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By making the above correction, the function now correctly determines the existence of the table based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`, leading to passing tests.
