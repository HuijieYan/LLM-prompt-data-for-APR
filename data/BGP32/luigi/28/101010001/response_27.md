1. **Analysis:**
   - The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
   - The function `run_hive_cmd` is called within the `table_exists` function.
   - The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is returning `False` for cases where it should return `True`.
   
2. **Error Location:**
   - The buggy part of the function seems to be the condition check and return logic based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - When checking for table existence, in the case where the table exists, the function checks if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
   - However, in the buggy implementation, the function fails to account for the possibility of extra whitespace or new line characters in the output.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - To fix the bug, trim any whitespace and new line characters from the output of `run_hive_cmd` before checking for table existence.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    # Fixed version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.strip() in stdout.strip()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace along with any new line characters from both the `table` and `stdout` before comparison.
- Instead of explicitly checking if `stdout` is present, we use the `bool()` function to determine if there was any output from `run_hive_cmd`.
- This corrected version should handle the comparison correctly and pass the failing test cases.
