### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking the existence of a table in the specified database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. The main issue causing the failing tests is with the logic of checking the existence of the table based on the command output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might be incorrect when checking for table existence.
2. The construction of the Hive command within the `else` block might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is not correctly parsing the output from the Hive command to determine the existence of the table. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` checks if the `table` string is present in the `stdout` output, but this condition might not be working correctly due to the format of the output from the Hive command. The constructed Hive command in the `else` block might not be forming the correct command string to check for table existence in a partition.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic of parsing the command output to accurately determine table existence.
2. Ensure that the Hive command construction within the `else` block is formed correctly to check for table existence in a partition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout)  # Convert to a boolean value for existence check
``` 

In this corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the stdout is split by newline to extract the list of existing tables so that the existence of the specified table can be accurately checked. In the case of checking in a partition, the partition spec is correctly incorporated into the Hive command to verify the existence of the table in the specified partition.
