### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking for the existence of a table.
3. The error message indicates that the test cases are failing because the function is returning `False` for existing tables.
4. The bug may be related to how the `stdout` is being checked for the table existence.
5. The function lacks proper handling of the output from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to incorrect evaluation of table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function in the `table_exists` method. When the output contains the table name, the function should return `True`, but it's not handling the output correctly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to properly handle the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` and check if the table exists based on the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')  # Check if table is in the list of partitions
```

By splitting the `stdout` based on the newline character and checking if the table is in the list, we can accurately determine the existence of the table. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
