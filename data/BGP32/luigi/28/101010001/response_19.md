### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `table_exists` function is not returning the expected result for the test cases provided. The first failing test is checking if a table exists, and it should return True when the table is found in the output. The second failing test is also checking if a case-insensitive table name check returns the correct result.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition of checking if a table exists might be incorrect.
2. The logic of parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function could be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be in the condition checking logic of the `table_exists` function. The function is returning False when it should return True due to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being parsed and compared.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is correctly handled.
2. Ensure that the condition for checking if a table exists is valid.
3. Consider if the comparison operation is properly evaluating the condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout  # Check if table is in the stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout has content, else False
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly checks if the table is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. It also correctly parses the partition string when provided. This version should pass the failing test cases.
