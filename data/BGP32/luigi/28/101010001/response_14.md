### Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly handling the case where the table exists in the Hive database. The implementation of the function is checking for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it fails in cases where the table name is part of a larger string in the output. This leads to the failing test cases where the expected result is not being achieved due to incorrect handling of the output.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition where `table in stdout` is checked might be incorrect.
2. The formatting of the command passed to `run_hive_cmd` may not be correct.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function is looking for an exact match of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the output contains additional information, the check fails even if the table exists in the database. This leads to the AssertionErrors in the failing test cases where the expected result is not met.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table name is present in a meaningful way. Instead of using a simple string comparison, we can split the output by newlines and check for the presence of the table name on a line-by-line basis.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By splitting the output by newlines and then checking for the presence of the table name in each line of the output, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify if the table exists in the Hive database or not.
