### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking whether a table exists in a Hive database by running specific Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the result of the command execution. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute Hive commands.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` might not properly handle the output of the Hive command.
2. The format of the Hive command and the way the `stdout` is checked in the `else` block might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from how the function interprets the output of the Hive commands. The function is expecting specific formatting in the `stdout` but fails to handle different cases properly. This causes incorrect evaluation of whether a table exists, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function properly captures and processes the output of the Hive commands.
2. Handle variations in the output format to accurately determine table existence.
3. Refactor the conditions in the function to correctly check for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Changed the Hive command from `show tables like` to `show tables in`.
- Modified the command in the `else` block to properly show partitions.
- Used `bool(stdout)` to check if `stdout` has any content, returning `True` if there is any output.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function accurately determines whether a table exists in a Hive database.
