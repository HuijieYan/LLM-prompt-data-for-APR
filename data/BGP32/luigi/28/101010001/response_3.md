1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command and searching for the table name in the command output. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same module to interact with Hive.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   a. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` could be problematic as the table name might not be perfectly matched in the command output.
   b. The query constructed in the else block might have formatting issues when calling the `partition_spec` function.

3. The cause of the bug is related to how the function processes the command output when determining the existence of a table. The error message indicates that the table is not detected as expected, leading to failing assertions.

4. To fix the bug, a more reliable way to check table existence can be implemented by parsing the output of the Hive command more accurately.

5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            table_exists_query = "use {0}; show partitions {1} ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(table_exists_query)
    
            return table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

In the corrected version, I split the stdout using whitespace to ensure an exact match on the table name. Additionally, ensuring that the table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before checking for existence.
