1. Analysis:
The function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine the existence of the table. The function takes optional arguments for the database and partition as well.

2. Error Location:
The error seems to be in the conditional statements where the function checks the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It fails to correctly handle the cases where the table exists or not.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first condition, the function checks if the table is in the stdout, but it fails to properly handle the cases where the table name is surrounded by other characters. In the second condition, the function only checks if the stdout is not empty but does not validate the presence of the table explicitly.

4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks to accurately determine the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It would involve parsing the stdout to extract the relevant information and then comparing it with the table name provided.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1} like "{2}";'.format(database, table, partition))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function by newline character to extract individual table names.
- We check if the `table` exists in the list of table names extracted from the stdout.
- The corrected version should now accurately determine the existence of the table in the given database or partition.
