### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The function `table_exists` checks if the table exists based on whether the output of the Hive command contains the table name.

The failing tests indicate that the issue lies in the comparison between the expected output and the actual output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not handle the case where the table name is present in the output but with additional content.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` does not account for cases where the table name appears with additional content.
2. The parsing of the output of the Hive command might not be accurate when checking for table existence.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is primarily due to the way it compares the table name in the Hive output. When the table name is present along with other information in the output, the comparison fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we check for the existence of the table in the Hive output. Instead of a direct string comparison, we should use a more robust method to validate the presence of the table name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, spec))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, when checking for the existence of a table, we split the stdout by newlines before checking if the table is in the output. This allows us to compare each line separately, ensuring that the table name is an individual line in the output.

Additionally, we use `bool(stdout)` to check for the existence of data in the `stdout` variable when dealing with partitioned tables.

These modifications should address the bug and make the function more reliable for checking table existence in Hive.
