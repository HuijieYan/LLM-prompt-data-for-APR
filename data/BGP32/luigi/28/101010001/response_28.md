### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not addressing the case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists. The function is expecting an exact match of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which results in the test failure when comparing lowercase and uppercase table names.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the comparison of the table name with the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should consider case insensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity when validating if a table exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The failing test cases are due to the mismatch in the case of the table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function should be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` function. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug and allowing the test cases to pass.
