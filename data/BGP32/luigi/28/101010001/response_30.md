#### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue seems to be with handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the output to determine if the table exists.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect parsing of the output from `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Incorrect formatting of the Hive command executed in the function.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the way the function is checking the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It is looking for the exact table name in the output without proper handling of the newline characters or spaces. This causes the condition check to fail even when the table exists in the database.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition check to handle cases where the table name may have newlines or additional characters.
2. Ensure that the formatting of the command executed in the function is correct.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. For the case where `partition is None`, the command is modified to `show tables` instead of using `like` and newline characters are handled by splitting the output.
2. For the case where `partition is not None`, the Hive command is formatted correctly and the check for stdout is simplified.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
