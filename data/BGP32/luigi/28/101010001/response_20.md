### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database and partition using the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
2. The first part of the `if` condition checks if the `partition` argument is `None`, in which case it tries to find the table directly. The second part of the `if` condition runs a Hive command to show partitions for the given table and partition combination.
3. The bug seems to be in the logic of checking the existence of a table. The buggy function is not handling the case where the return value from `run_hive_cmd` contains the table names along with other text like "OK\n" and failing to correctly parse it.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and ensure that the table name matches exactly.
5. The corrected version of the function will properly handle parsing the output to match the table name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True if table in stdout.split('\n') else False
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking if the `table` exists in the resulting list of table names, we ensure that we correctly parse the output and match the table name with precision, fixing the bug.
