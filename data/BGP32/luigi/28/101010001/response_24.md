### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly capturing whether a table exists in the specified database. The bug seems to be related to how the return values from the `run_hive_cmd` function are being handled.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect condition check of whether the table exists or not.
2. Incorrect passing of arguments in the `run_hive_cmd` function which queries for table existence.
3. Incorrect handling of the return value from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the improper handling of return values from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation checks if the stdout is not empty in the `if stdout:` block, which might not be accurate in telling whether the table exists or not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `run_hive_cmd` function is correctly called with the appropriate query for table existence. Additionally, we should properly handle the return values to determine if the table exists.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return stdout and (table in stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We are querying for all tables in the database using `show tables;` instead of specifically checking for the given table. This ensures that the function is checking whether the table exists in the database.
2. For the partition case, we are querying for all partitions of the table and then checking if the specified partition exists.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
