### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not properly handling the case where the table exists in the output from `run_hive_cmd`, resulting in failing test cases. The bug causes the `table_exists` function to incorrectly return `False` when it should return `True` for existing tables.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not correctly evaluate if the table is present in the `stdout` output.
2. The formating of the Hive command in the else block may not be constructing the command properly.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function fails to account for the case where the table name should be found in the output from running Hive commands. This mismatch results in incorrect evaluations and returning `False` when the table actually exists, causing the test cases to fail.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by properly checking if the table name is correctly present in the output from `run_hive_cmd` in both branches of the conditional statements within the `table_exists` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_output = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_output))

            return stdout is not None
    
```

By correcting the conditional checks and properly formatting the Hive command in the else block, the corrected `table_exists` function should now accurately determine whether a table exists in the Hive environment. This should resolve the failing test cases.
