### Analyzing the buggy function and related functions

The buggy function, `table_exists`, checks if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The function `run_hive_cmd` is defined outside the class but in the same file and is called within the `table_exists` function.

The error message indicates that the test cases are failing because the returned value from `table_exists` does not match the expected value. Specifically, the test cases are failing when the table exists, which indicates that there might be an issue with how the function checks for the table's existence.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The condition to check if the table exists (`return stdout and table in stdout`) might not be correctly evaluating when the table is present.
2. The handling of the stdout when `run_hive_cmd` is executed for checking partitions may lead to incorrect results.

### Cause of the bug

The bug in the `table_exists` function might stem from the way the function processes the results obtained from `run_hive_cmd`. Depending on how the commands are executed and the response from Hive, the condition for checking table existence might not be accurate.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table_exists` function correctly handles the output from `run_hive_cmd` in both cases when checking for the table directly and when checking partitions. We should verify that the logic for checking the existence of the table is sound and returns the expected results based on the Hive commands executed.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
            return table in stdout.split() if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The stdout from `run_hive_cmd` is stripped to remove any leading or trailing spaces or line breaks.
- In the case where the table is directly checked, the condition for table existence is based on whether the table name is present in the list of tables obtained from the command output.
- For checking partitions, the presence of stdout (indicating the existence of partitions) is simply evaluated to determine if the table exists.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should address the bug and correctly determine the existence of tables in a Hive database.
