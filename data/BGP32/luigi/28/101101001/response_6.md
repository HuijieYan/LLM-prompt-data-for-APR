### Potential Error Locations
1. The `table_exists` function is checking if the table name exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may not always be accurate.
2. The check for table existence when a partition is provided might be incorrect due to the way the command is being executed with `self.partition_spec(partition)`.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the way it checks for the existence of a table in the output returned by `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly assumes that finding the table name in the `stdout` output implies the table exists.

In the failing tests:
- In Case 1, the `stdout` only contains 'OK', but the function incorrectly returns True.
- In Case 2, the `stdout` contains 'OK\nmytable', which leads to the correct return, but the buggy function doesn't handle case insensitivity correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Modify the condition to check if the table name is an exact match in the `stdout` output.
2. Handle case insensitivity for table names.
3. Ensure the partition check in the else block is correctly implemented.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join([f'{key}="{value}"' for key, value in partition.items()])
        cmd = f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})'
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(cmd)

        return stdout and f'{table}={partition_str}' in stdout
```

This corrected version:
- Utilizes the `split()` method to check for exact table name existence and handles case insensitivity.
- Builds the partition condition correctly in the else block to ensure accurate table existence checking.
