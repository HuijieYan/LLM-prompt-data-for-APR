### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking if the given table exists in the specified database, especially when dealing with case-sensitive table names. The bug arises from the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable.

In the provided failing test cases, the discrepancies are observed when comparing the expected table names with the actual `stdout` values. The buggy function only checks if the table name is present in `stdout`, which leads to incorrect results in cases where the table name matches partially or if it's case-sensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` value should be case-insensitive. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the table names are included in a single line or if there are multiple table names in the `stdout`. 

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in table_list if t.strip())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then comparing the lowercased table names, the corrected function can accurately determine if the given table exists in the database. This approach handles case-insensitivity and variations in the format of the `stdout` output.
