### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the provided test cases due to the incorrect logic used to check the presence of the table and partition in Hive. The function first checks for the table existence only, and then separately tries to check for the partition. However, the logic to check for each case individually is flawed.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the way the function handles the stdout output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. It incorrectly checks for the presence of the table in stdout without considering the cases where the table name might be present in the middle of other strings. Additionally, the partition case is not handled properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to properly handle the stdout output and check for the table existence within the correct context.
2. Update the function to handle partition existence checks correctly by including the partition details in the query to `run_hive_cmd` and verifying the output accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function with fixed logic
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()

    else:
        partition_query = " AND ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1}.{2} where {3};'.format(database, database, table, partition_query)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        return stdout and "FAILED" not in stdout  # Assuming "FAILED" is a string indicating no result

# Helper function to split the stdout into table names
def get_table_names(stdout):
    return [line.split('/')[-1].strip() for line in stdout.split()]

# The corrected version now properly checks for table and partition existence
``` 

By making these corrections, the function will now handle the table and partition existence checks correctly, resolving the issues identified in the failing test cases.
