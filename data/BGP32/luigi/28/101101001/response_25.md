The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the function processes the stdout received from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly checks if the table name is present in the stdout without considering the newlines.

The buggy function checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout directly, which may lead to incorrect results due to the presence of newline characters. The function needs to split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in the resulting list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to split the stdout by newline characters before checking for the table name's presence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters before checking for the table name, the corrected function should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test cases.
