### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It does so by running a Hive query to check for the table's existence. The bug appears to be related to how the function processes the output (`stdout`) of the Hive command.

### Bug Cause
1. In the first part of the `if` condition where `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` returned from the Hive command. However, the comparison `table in stdout` could return `False` even when the `table` actually exists in the database due to the way `stdout` is processed.
   
2. In the second part of the `if` condition where `partition` is not `None`, a similar issue arises where the function checks the existence of the table based on the presence of any output from the Hive command, instead of checking the actual content. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic for checking the existence of the table based on the content of the `stdout`.
2. Ensure that the function correctly interprets the output of the Hive command to determine the existence of the table.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In this corrected version:
- The stdout is split into individual lines to accurately check the table's presence.
- The module is reworked to correctly evaluate if there is any output in the stdout to determine the table's existence.
  
By addressing these issues, the function should now correctly identify the existence of the table in the Hive database.
