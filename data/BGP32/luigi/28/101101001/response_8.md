### Bug analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` fails the tests because the condition for checking if the table exists is flawed. In the first part where `partition` is `None`, it checks if the table name is in the `stdout`. However, in the second part where `partition` is not `None`, it only checks if `stdout` exists, leading to a logical error.

### Bug explanation
1. In Case 1, even though the table exists (`mytable` is in the `stdout`), the return value is incorrect because the condition only checks if `stdout` exists, not if the table name is in it.
2. In Case 2, the same issue occurs where the table name is in the `stdout`, but the return is incorrect due to the flawed condition.
3. In Case 3, the return value is incorrect because the condition only checks if `stdout` exists, regardless of the table name.
4. In Case 4, the `stdout` does not contain the table name (`mytable`), but the function incorrectly returns `True` because of the flawed condition.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition logic in both parts of the `table_exists` function. We should check if the table name is in the `stdout` when `partition` is not `None` as well. This will ensure that the function correctly determines if the table exists based on the `stdout`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
```

By updating the return condition in the second part of the function to check if `stdout` is not `None` and the table name is in the `stdout`, we ensure the function behaves correctly and passes the failing tests.
