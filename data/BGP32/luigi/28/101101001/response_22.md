### Identified Bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is incorrectly checking if the `table` exists in the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The existing logic only checks if the `table` is present in the entire `stdout` string, leading to incorrect results when the `table` name is a subset of another table name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we should split the `stdout` string into lines and then check if the `table` exists as a separate line in the output. This way, we ensure that we are matching the exact table name instead of part of the string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout != ""
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly check if the table exists by comparing it with each line in the `stdout` output, ensuring accurate results.
