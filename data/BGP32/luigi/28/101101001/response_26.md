The issue with the provided `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case-insensitive check for table existence properly. The function checks if the table name is in the stdout string returned from `run_hive_cmd`. However, the comparison between table names is case-sensitive, which leads to failing tests in scenarios where the table names differ only in case.

To fix this issue, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking the table existence in the stdout string. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the stdout string to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout string to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests, specifically the case-insensitive table name checks.
