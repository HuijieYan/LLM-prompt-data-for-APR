### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check of the stdout variable. When the function checks if the table name is in the stdout variable, it does not handle the case where the table name might exist as a substring within a different table name. This results in incorrect checks for table existence.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that the table name is matched as a whole word within the stdout variable. One way to achieve this is by using regular expressions to match the table name with word boundaries (\b).

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and re.search(r'\b{0}\b'.format(re.escape(table)), stdout) is not None
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using regular expressions and enforcing word boundaries, the corrected function ensures accurate checks for the existence of the table name within the stdout variable.
