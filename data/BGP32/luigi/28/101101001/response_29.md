### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the returned output from the `run_hive_cmd` function when checking for the presence of the table.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the way the function checks for the existence of the table in the Hive database. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function incorrectly checks if the table name is present in the output as a substring, leading to false negatives when the table name is the same as the output. In Case 2 and Case 4, the function correctly handles checking for the existence of the table, but it is case-sensitive, causing it to fail when the table name casing changes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner. This can be done by converting both the table names to lowercase before comparing them in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By using the `lower()` method on both the table names and the output during comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the table existence in the Hive database. This correction should resolve the bug and allow the failing tests to pass.
