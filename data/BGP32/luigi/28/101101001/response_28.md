### Issue:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it doesn't handle the case when the table name is present in the `stdout` along with other text, causing the check to fail even when the table actually exists.

### Fix:
To fix the issue, we need to modify the condition that checks if the table exists in the `stdout`. Instead of checking if the table name is present as a whole in the `stdout`, we need to check if the table name is a separate word in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By checking each line separately in the `stdout` and comparing it with the table name, we ensure that we only return `True` if the table name is a separate word in the output. This change should make the function pass the failing test cases.
