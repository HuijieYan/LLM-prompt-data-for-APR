The buggy function `table_exists` has the following issues:
1. In the `if partition is None:` branch, the condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. It should check if `table` is in `stdout.split('\n')` instead.
2. In the `else:` branch, the construction of the Hive command is incorrect as it doesn't include the partition specification correctly.

To fix these issues:
1. In the `if partition is None:` branch, modify the condition to `table in stdout.split('\n')` to correctly check if the table exists in the output.
2. In the `else:` branch, fix the construction of the Hive command to include the partition specification properly.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_clause = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_clause))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
