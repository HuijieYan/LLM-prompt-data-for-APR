The buggy function `table_exists` fails in the test cases provided because it incorrectly checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function only checks if the table name is present in the `stdout`, which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the table name is in the `stdout` to ensure that it is a separate entity and not just a substring within another word. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The key change in the corrected function is to split the `stdout` by spaces to ensure that the table name exists as a separate entity in the list of tables returned by the `show tables` command.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
