The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked. The function is checking if the table name is in the output string without considering case sensitivity. This causes the test cases that check for case sensitivity to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case-insensitive, fixing the failing test cases mentioned in the test function.
