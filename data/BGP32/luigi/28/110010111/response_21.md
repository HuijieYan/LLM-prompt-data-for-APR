### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message, expected input/output values, and GitHub issue:

The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` checks if a table exists in the specified database. The function interacts with the Hive database by running commands and checking the output.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not returning the correct results when checking if a table exists. The expected input values include the database name, table name, and partition (if applicable). The expected output values are booleans indicating whether the table exists.

The GitHub issue (#896) explains that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive when checking table names due to differences in capitalization across Hive implementations. The proposed fix involves checking the lowercase version of the table name against the lowercase output from Hive.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

The buggy function may have an issue with case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output retrieved from Hive. This could lead to incorrect results in the function's return statement.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug likely stems from the function comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case sensitivity. This would cause discrepancies in the comparison, leading to incorrect boolean returns.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to update the `table_exists` function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase output from Hive. This will ensure a case-insensitive check and align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This revision aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug.
