### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in Hive by running a Hive command and analyzing the output.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in table names causing the test to fail.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing due to False being returned instead of True in certain cases where the table name casing doesn't match exactly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output to be case-insensitive.
5. We should modify the return statement in the function to compare lowercased versions of both strings to ensure a case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
