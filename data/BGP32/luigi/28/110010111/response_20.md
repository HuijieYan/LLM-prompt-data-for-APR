### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database. However, the comparison is case-sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
3. The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table names obtained from Hive commands. The test cases expect case-insensitive comparison, leading to failures. The expected outputs in the test cases are based on case-insensitive matching.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive.
5. I will modify the function to convert both the table name and the outputs from the Hive commands to lowercase before comparing. This will ensure case-insensitive matching.

### Corrected version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now the `table_exists` function will convert both the table name and the outputs from the Hive commands to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case-insensitive matching. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
