### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks whether a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command. The issue arises due to case sensitivity while comparing the table name extracted from the Hive command output with the provided table name.
2. The bug occurs when the provided table name or the table name in the Hive output is in a different case than expected.
3. The bug is causing assertions to fail because the comparison is case sensitive, leading to unexpected results. The GitHub issue raised indicates that the comparison should be case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case insensitive.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the names extracted from the Hive command output to lowercase during comparison, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence.
