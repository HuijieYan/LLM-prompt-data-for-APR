### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a given table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when the function fails to account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output obtained from Hive.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not returning the correct value when checking for table existence.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the function not considering case sensitivity in table name comparisons. The expected behavior should be case insensitive, as mentioned in the GitHub issues.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database. This fix addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issues.
