### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` checks if a table exists in a database by querying Hive via command line. The bug is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the query result.
2. The potential error locations are when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the provided table name, which can cause case sensitivity issues.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner, causing test failures when the case of the table names does not match. This bug was raised in GitHub issue #896, suggesting making the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid such issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner when checking for table existence.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            # Check for existence in a case-insensitive manner
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to check the lowercase versions of the table names, the corrected function will now be more resilient to case sensitivity issues and pass the failing tests.
