### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function does not handle case insensitivity in table names, leading to test failures if the table names are provided in different cases than what is returned by the Hive commands.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that in case-insensitive scenarios, the function is directly comparing the table name with the output from the Hive commands without converting them to a consistent case (usually lower case). This inconsistency leads to `False` values when they should be considered equivalent.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, the table name provided should be converted to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparing it against the output from Hive commands.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, both the `table` parameter and the output from Hive commands are converted to lower case for a case-insensitive comparison. This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly in scenarios where table names might vary in case.
