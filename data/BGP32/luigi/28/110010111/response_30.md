### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison of `table` with `stdout` might not handle case insensitivity properly.
2. The logic inside the `if` and `else` blocks might not be branching correctly based on the input.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises from the fact that the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` from the Hive command is case-sensitive. This causes the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence in both case-sensitive and case-insensitive scenarios, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` output is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before making the comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures that the table existence check is performed in a case-insensitive manner. This correction aligns with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue #896.
