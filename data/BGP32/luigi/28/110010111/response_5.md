### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module. This function is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and retrieve information.

2. The failing test provided mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function and tests the behavior of `table_exists` for different input scenarios. The test checks if the function correctly identifies the existence of a table based on the output received from running Hive commands.

3. In cases where the table name is uppercase or mixed case, the function fails to correctly identify the existence due to case sensitivity. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive commands without considering case differences, leading to failing assertions.

### Identifying potential error locations and causes

1. The bug occurs in the comparison of the `table` variable with the output `stdout` from Hive commands.
2. In the cases provided, the expected table name is different in case from the output of Hive commands, causing the function to return incorrect results.
3. The bug is due to the function not handling case sensitivity when checking table existence, leading to assertions failing in the test cases.
4. To fix this bug, the function should convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to a consistent case format (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. This ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence, resolving the failing test cases.
3. Update the function logic to handle table name comparisons irrespective of case differences.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function addresses the case sensitivity issue and ensures the function behaves correctly in scenarios where table names have different cases. This fix aligns with the suggested strategy and resolves the failing test cases.
