### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and validate the table's existence based on the output.

The failing test indicates an `AssertionError` when checking for table existence, specifically related to case sensitivity. The test expects the function to be case insensitive when checking for table names.

### Identified Errors
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity when checking for table names.
2. The function might return `False` when it should return `True` based on the case-insensitive check.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to fail the case sensitivity check. If the table name in the Hive output has a different case than the input table name, the function may inaccurately return `False` instead of `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. We can convert both the table name and the output to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function:
- We convert both the `table` input parameter and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them.
- We use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
- We return `True` if the table is found in the output after converting both to lowercase.
- We return `False` if the `stdout` is empty or the table is not found.

By making these changes, the function now handles case sensitivity correctly and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
