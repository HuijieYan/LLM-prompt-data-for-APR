### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database with the provided partition.
2. The issue arises when the table names are case-sensitive and do not match the casing in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The issue is related to the case sensitivity of table names where uppercase and lowercase characters make a difference, which leads to incorrect comparison results.
4. The suggested fix is to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
5. The corrected version below addresses the issue by converting the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
1. I have modified the comparison in the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` function before the comparison. This ensures case-insensitive matching.
2. The comparison now checks if the lowercase table name exists in the lowercase stdout string.
3. The function now returns `True` if the table exists (lowercase match found), otherwise `False`.
4. This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and is in line with the suggested fix mentioned in the GitHub discussion.
