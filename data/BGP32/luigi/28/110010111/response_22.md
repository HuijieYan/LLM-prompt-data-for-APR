### Analysis:
- The function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to return `True` if a table exists in the specified database or partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run corresponding Hive commands and check the output.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The function is case-sensitive. It checks if the table name exactly matches the output from Hive commands, leading to test failures when the case differs.
2. There is an issue in building the Hive command to check for partitions. The `show partitions` command should include the table name before the `partition` keyword.

### Bug Cause:
The function compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures in tests where the case differs from the actual table name in Hive. The incorrect format for the `show partitions` command also causes the function to fail in checking for partitions correctly.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Update the comparison of table names to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
2. Adjust the format of the Hive command used to check for partitions to include the table name before the `partition` keyword.

### Corrected Code:
I have provided the corrected version of the `table_exists` function below:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both table names and the output to lowercase, the function will now be case-insensitive when checking for table existence. The corrected Hive command format ensures that partitions are checked correctly.
