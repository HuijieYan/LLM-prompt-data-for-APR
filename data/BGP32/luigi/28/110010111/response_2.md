### Analysis:
The bug is related to the case sensitivity of the table name comparison in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is failing to handle case-insensitive comparisons, leading to test failures.

### Error Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` directly compares the table name without considering case sensitivity. When the table name provided does not match exactly with the ones returned by Hive in stdout due to case differences, the comparison fails, resulting in the test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output returned by Hive. By converting both strings to lower or upper case before comparison, we can ensure that the comparison is not influenced by the case of the characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the output of Hive commands to lowercase before checking for existence. This modification ensures that the test cases pass, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
