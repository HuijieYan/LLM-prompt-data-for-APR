### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database. However, the function has a bug related to case sensitivity, causing the tests to fail.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison between the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is performing a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd`. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name does not match the case of the table name in the hive output.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be made case-insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected function is provided below.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the fixed version of the function now correctly checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner. This update addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the function passes the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
