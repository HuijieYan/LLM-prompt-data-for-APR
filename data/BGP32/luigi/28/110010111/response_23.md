### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `hive.py` file is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and determine if a table exists by analyzing the command's output.

The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results when checking for table existence due to case sensitivity issues. The failing test cases highlight the problem with case sensitivity when comparing table names with the output from Hive commands.

### Identifying potential error locations

The bug likely stems from how the function compares the expected table name with the table names extracted from Hive commands. The comparison operation might not be handling case sensitivity correctly, leading to false results.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

When the buggy function receives a table name, it runs a Hive command to retrieve information about tables and then checks if the table exists based on the command output. The issue arises when there is a case mismatch between the expected table name and the output table names from Hive commands.

The bug causes incorrect results in the test cases because the function directly compares the expected table name (possibly in a different case) with the table names obtained from Hive commands, without considering case sensitivity.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, we need to ensure that the comparison between the expected table name and the retrieved table names from Hive commands is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the expected table name and the retrieved table names to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version above, we convert both the expected `table` name and the retrieved table names (`stdout`) to lowercase before comparing them. This modification ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
