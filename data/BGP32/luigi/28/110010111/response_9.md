### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a given database.
2. The bug is causing the test cases to fail due to case sensitivity when comparing the table names.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function directly compares the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which is sensitive to case differences.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The fix involves modifying the comparison logic to use lowercase versions of the table name and the output.

### Fix strategy:
1. Convert the `table` variable to lowercase before comparing with the `stdout` variable.
2. Update the comparison logic to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase `stdout` to handle case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive and using lowercase versions of the table name and output, the corrected function should successfully pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
