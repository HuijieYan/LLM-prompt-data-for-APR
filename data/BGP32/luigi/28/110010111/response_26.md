### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a given table exists in a Hive database. The bug occurs when checking the presence of the table by comparing the table name with the output from a Hive command. The issue arises due to case sensitivity in table names causing the test cases to fail.
2. The bug is primarily located in the comparison step where the table name should be converted to lowercase before checking if it exists in the output string.
3. The bug is caused because the table names retrieved from Hive commands are not case-sensitive, leading to failures in the test cases where the table names differ in case from the output. The expected behavior should be to perform a case-insensitive comparison to handle such scenarios.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive commands are converted to lowercase before comparison to handle case insensitivity correctly.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                  (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles case-insensitivity correctly. This solution aligns with the GitHub issue (#896) and resolves the failing test cases.
