### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a database.
- There is a bug where the function is case-sensitive when comparing the table name in the `stdout`, leading to test failures in case of different casing.
- The expected behavior should be case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.
- Two test cases are provided along with expected input values and respective function behaviors.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the fact that the function compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner, causing test failures when the table names have different casing.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` to be case-insensitive. We can achieve this by comparing lowercased versions of both the table name and the `stdout`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the corrected `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence, resolving the bug and allowing the tests to pass.
