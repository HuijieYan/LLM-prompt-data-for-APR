### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is comparing the table name against the stdout received from `run_hive_cmd` directly without considering case sensitivity.
2. The expected output values for the failing test cases are not being met due to the case sensitivity issue.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle variations in table names.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` data are converted to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function.
- This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and matches the expected behavior.
- With this modification, the function will now pass the failing test cases and handle variations in table names more effectively.
