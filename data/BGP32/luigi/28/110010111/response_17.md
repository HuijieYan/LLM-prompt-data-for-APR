### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is currently case-sensitive when checking for table existence in the `stdout` output.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive to handle cases where tables have different case conventions.
3. The failing tests show that the function fails to correctly identify the table existence in a case-insensitive manner. The expected values provided in the test cases indicate the desired behavior of the function.
4. To fix the bug, the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner against the output received from Hive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function's direct comparison of the table name to the output string without considering case sensitivity. This leads to false results when the table case does not match exactly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the function to check if the lowercase version of the table name is present in the lowercase version of the `stdout` string. This adjustment will make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase `stdout` string, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the expectations outlined in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
