### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is designed to check if a table exists in a database, using `hive` invocations. The function has two code branches depending on whether a partition is specified or not.

2. The bug appears to be related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence, as indicated by the failing test cases. The issue on GitHub (#896) also mentions the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function's comparison of the `table` parameter with the `stdout` output is case sensitive, leading to failures when the table names do not match exactly in terms of case.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the function to be case insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to use case insensitive checking for table names.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive. This modification ensures that table existence is determined irrespective of the case of the table name specified or returned by the `hive` invocation, fixing the bug reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
