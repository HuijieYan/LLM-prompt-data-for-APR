### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function checks if a table exists in a database using a given table name. The bug occurs when comparing the table name to the stdout in a case-sensitive manner.
2. The potential error locations are within the comparison of `table` and `stdout`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output received from the Hive command. If the table names are in different cases, the comparison fails, leading to assertions.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to a consistent case (lower or upper).
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, resolving the bug.
