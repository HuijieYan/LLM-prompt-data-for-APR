### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is causing the test cases to fail due to case sensitivity. The function is not comparing the table name in a case-insensitive manner, leading to the tests failing when the table name case differs. The expected behavior is for the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of table names in the `if` condition.
2. The case sensitivity issue while comparing table names.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function compares the table name directly with the output string from the `run_hive_cmd`, which leads to case-sensitive comparisons. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names are different due to case discrepancies. The expected behavior is for the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison to account for variations in table name casing.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output string to perform a case-insensitive check. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison. This modification will ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in casing.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` variables are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` function. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the issue highlighted in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
