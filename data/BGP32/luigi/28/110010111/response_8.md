### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to failing test cases in certain scenarios as described in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparisons of table names in the `stdout` variable.
2. Handling of different cases for table names in input and output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the table name comparison not accounting for case sensitivity. When a table name is provided as input, the function checks if that exact name exists in the `stdout`, which may be in a different case causing the function to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.strip, stdout.lower().split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version:
1. Both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` variable are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method.
2. The `stdout` is split into lines (assuming multiple table names might be listed) to handle multiple table listings.

This corrected version should resolve the case sensitivity issue and pass the failing test cases.
