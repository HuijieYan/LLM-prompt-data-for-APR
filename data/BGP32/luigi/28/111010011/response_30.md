## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified Hive database.
   
2. The function makes use of another function `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.

3. The test failures indicate that the function is case-sensitive when checking if a table exists. Due to Hive being case-insensitive, the function fails the tests as it doesn't consider the case difference between the provided table name and the one returned by Hive.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

## Fixing the bug

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version above, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive check by converting both the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the function correctly determines if a table exists in the specified database regardless of the case.
