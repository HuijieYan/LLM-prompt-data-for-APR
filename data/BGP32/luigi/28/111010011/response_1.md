### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database.
2. The failing test case is related to the scenario where the table name is provided in different cases (lowercase, uppercase, mixed case).
3. The error message indicates that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing the test cases to fail.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the function needs to be made case insensitive by checking `stdout` against the lowercase version of the table name.

### Solution:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to be case insensitive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive. This correction should address the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
