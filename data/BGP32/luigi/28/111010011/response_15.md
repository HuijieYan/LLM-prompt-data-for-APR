### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in `luigi.contrib.hive.py` file. It checks if a table exists in a database by running hive commands.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because it's not handling case insensitivity correctly.
3. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the table names in a case-insensitive manner.
4. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly without considering case differences.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `table_exists` function not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the returned output from the hive command.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            return stdout.lower().strip() == 'ok'
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the stdout from the hive command are converted to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the table existence check is case insensitive.
