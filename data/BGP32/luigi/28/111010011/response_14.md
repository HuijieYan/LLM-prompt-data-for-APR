## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is checking for table existence in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures for tables with different cases.
2. The issue arises when the table name passed as an argument to the `table_exists` function is not in the exact case as returned by Hive.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the table name comparison is case-sensitive.
4. The related GitHub issues suggest that the function should be made case-insensitive to avoid such issues in Hive table existence checks.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to ensure it handles case differences in table names correctly.
3. Use the `lower()` method to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the comparison of table names is now case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This change ensures that the test for table existence in Hive is not affected by case differences in table names.
