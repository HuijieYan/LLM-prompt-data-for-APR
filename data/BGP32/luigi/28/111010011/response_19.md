### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity of the table names correctly.
2. The failing test cases show that the function is expecting the table existence check to be case insensitive, but it is not implemented that way in the function.
3. The related function `run_hive_cmd` is returning table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail when the table name is capitalized. The error message indicates that the function is returning `False` instead of `True` for the case-insensitive check.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive by checking the table name in lowercase against the output.
5. To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the table names returned in the `stdout`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the table names in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function to return `True` if the lowercase table name is found in the lowercase `stdout`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By making this change, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table, as requested in the GitHub issue.
