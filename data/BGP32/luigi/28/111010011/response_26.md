### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for table existence in a case-sensitive manner by directly comparing the table name to the output of a Hive command. However, the Hive command may return the table name in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the comparison of table names is resulting in False when it should be True due to case differences.
3. The GitHub issue raised by a user suggests that table existence checking should be made case-insensitive by comparing the table name in lowercase.
4. The suggested fix is to compare the lowercase representation of the table name with the lowercase output of the Hive command to handle case-insensitivity.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case-sensitive comparison issue:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive table existence checks.
