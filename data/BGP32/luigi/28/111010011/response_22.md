### Analysis:
1. The bug is related to the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class, where it fails a case sensitivity test in the unit tests.
2. The `table_exists` function makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` function to check for the existence of a table in Hive.
3. The bug occurs because when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, it does a case-sensitive check which causes the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between `table` and `stdout` should be done in a case-insensitive manner.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them in the `table_exists` function.
2. By doing a case-insensitive comparison, the bug can be resolved and the test should pass.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison, the bug should now be fixed and the test should pass successfully.
