### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. The issue arises when the function compares the table name against the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
2. The test cases are failing because the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output is case sensitive.
3. The GitHub issue and the failing test cases indicate that the comparison should be case insensitive to handle scenarios where table names are returned in different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to standardize the comparison by converting both the table name and the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
- Update the function to return `stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()` for the comparison logic to be case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive in the `table_exists` function, the corrected version should ensure that the test cases pass and address the issue reported on GitHub related to case sensitivity in table existence checks in Hive.
