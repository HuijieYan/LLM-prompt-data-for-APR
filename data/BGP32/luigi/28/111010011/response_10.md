### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is designed to check if a table exists in the specified database. The issue arises when it performs a case-sensitive comparison between the table names.

The error message indicates that the test cases fail due to case sensitivity. The GitHub issues related to this problem suggest that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive to handle table names regardless of their case.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison operation in the `if` condition may not handle case insensitivity correctly.
2. The return values of `run_hive_cmd` function may not be case insensitive, leading to failed comparisons.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the fact that the `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table names. Hive is case insensitive, but the function compares the table names directly without considering case differences. Hence, it fails the test cases where table names have different cases.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the current bug, we need to ensure that the comparison performed in the `table_exists` function is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to a consistent case (like lowercase) before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation of the Correction
In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, both the `table` and the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, allowing the function to correctly determine if the table exists in the database regardless of the case used.
