### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in the specified database. The issue arises when comparing the table name in a case-sensitive manner without considering the case insensitivity of Hive. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling the case insensitivity properly.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the comparison statement `table in stdout` where the comparison is done without considering the case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that Hive is case-insensitive when it comes to checking table existence, but the function `table_exists` is performing a case-sensitive comparison. This discrepancy leads to the failing test cases as demonstrated in the error messages.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists in the stdout result obtained from Hive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in Hive. This correction aligns with the suggestions made in the GitHub issue discussions.
