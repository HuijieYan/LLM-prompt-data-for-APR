### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check for table existence.
2. The error occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table name retrieved from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The related GitHub issue (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking `table.lower()` against the stdout in a case-insensitive manner.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
5. We will correct the bug in the `table_exists` function by implementing a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                       (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive in the corrected version, the `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
