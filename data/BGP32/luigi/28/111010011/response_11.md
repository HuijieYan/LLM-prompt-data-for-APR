### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is failing the tests due to case sensitivity in comparing the table names.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` with appropriate queries to check for the existence of a table but doesn't handle case-insensitive comparison of table names causing the test failures.
3. The error message clearly states that the tests are failing because the comparison is case sensitive, and the issue on GitHub also confirms the same concern.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the check to perform a case-insensitive comparison of table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name being checked and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison.
2. This modification will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for the table's existence. This change should fix the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
