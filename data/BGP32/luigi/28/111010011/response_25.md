### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in the specified database using Hive commands.
2. The failing test checks if the function correctly identifies the existence of a table, but it fails for case-sensitive table names.
3. The error occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the stdout, which may not match due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and stdout to lowercase before the comparison.
2. Update the condition to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase stdout.
3. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and the test will pass for tables with varying case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function is now fixed. It resolves the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
