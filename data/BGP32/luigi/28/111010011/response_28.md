### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence in a case-sensitive manner against the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The failing test cases are failing because the returned output from `run_hive_cmd` is in lowercase, causing the check to fail.
3. The GitHub issue sheds light on the fact that the table existence check should be case-insensitive, and the fix involves comparing the table name in lowercase with the output in lowercase.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification will resolve the failing test cases and align with the fix proposed in the corresponding GitHub issue.
