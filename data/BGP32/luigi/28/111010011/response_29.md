### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name in the stdout with the given table name might result in case sensitivity issues.
2. The function might not be handling case insensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests.
3. The function might not be converting table name to lowercase for comparison with the stdout.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity correctly. Since Hive is case insensitive, when checking for table existence, the comparison between the table name provided and the table name in the stdout should be case insensitive. However, the function is performing a direct comparison without converting the names to lowercase. This causes the test cases to fail when there are differences in case between the table names.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, the function should convert both the table name provided and the table name in the stdout to lowercase before comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table name from stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases as the comparison becomes case insensitive.
