## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The issue arises because the function compares the table name directly with the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences. This leads to test failures when checking for table existence.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the table name with the `stdout` without considering case.
2. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This leads to case-sensitive comparisons and test failures.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that both the table name and the `stdout` content are in lowercase before performing the comparison. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the test failures.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` content to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures case-insensitive matching, fixing the bug reported in the failing tests and GitHub issues.
