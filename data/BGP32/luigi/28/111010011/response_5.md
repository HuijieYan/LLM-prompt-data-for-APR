### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling the case insensitivity of table names when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The issue is related to the fact that Hive is case insensitive and the function does not take that into account when comparing the table name in the output.
3. The failing test cases are checking for table existence using different cases (`mytable`, `MyTable`) which causes the assertion error since the function is not case insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lower case before comparison to account for Hive's case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
- Updated the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output to lower case before comparing to ensure case insensitivity.
- Used `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive.
- Removed unnecessary `if stdout: return True else: return False` as it's simpler to directly return the result of the comparison.
- The bug fix aligns with the suggested strategy in the GitHub issue to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub.
