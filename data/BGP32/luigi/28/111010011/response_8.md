### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database. The issue arises when the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly, causing tests to fail.
2. The failing tests are indicating that the function is not treating table names in a case-insensitive manner.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the function comparing the table name as is instead of converting it to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. The GitHub issue highlights the need to handle case sensitivity correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before checking if the table exists.
   
### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the function will now correctly handle case insensitivity, fixing the bug as reported in the failing tests and GitHub issues.
