### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database.

- The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.

- The failing test cases are related to case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence. Hive is case insensitive, so the function needs to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.

- The GitHub issue #896 relates to this problem, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive in its comparison.

### Identified potential error locations:
- The comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function might be causing the failure due to case sensitivity.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by the comparison in the `table_exists` function which is case sensitive. This leads to failing test cases when table names are not in the exact case as shown in the output from Hive.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
# Corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, the corrected version of the function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This should resolve the failing test cases and align with the fix suggested in GitHub issue #896.
