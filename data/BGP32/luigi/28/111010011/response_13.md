### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
2. The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to interact with Hive.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing when the table name case is different from what is returned by Hive output.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking table names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not taking into account case sensitivity. If the table name provided is in a different case than what is returned by Hive, the test fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison of the table name case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase during comparison, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing tests.
