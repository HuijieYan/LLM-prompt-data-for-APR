### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.
2. The error is occurring because the function compares the exact table name with the output of the command run in Hive, which may have different case sensitivity.
3. The GitHub issue (#896) suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by comparing the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase output from Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to consider case insensitivity.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing.
2. Update the return statement to check if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase output from Hive.
3. This modification will make the function case insensitive and resolve the failing test cases reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" 
                                  % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison.
- The `table_exists` function now uses case insensitive comparison logic.
- The `bool(stdout)` is used to check if stdout is not empty (instead of using if-else).
- The corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue in table existence checks in Hive.
