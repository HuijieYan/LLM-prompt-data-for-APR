### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison in the `table_exists` function is case-sensitive, causing the test to fail for table names with different cases.
2. The `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity properly.
3. The issue is related to the handling of table names in different cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the case-sensitive comparison in the `table_exists` function. The function is checking if the table name exists in the output from Hive without considering the case of the table name. This inconsistency leads to failing tests when tables with different cases exist in the database. The test cases expect case-insensitive behavior, which the current implementation does not provide.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `table_exists` function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. By doing this, the function will correctly determine the existence of the table regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to compare both the table name and the output in lowercase, the corrected version ensures case-insensitive behavior. This fix addresses the failing test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
