### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in the given database.
2. The error occurs when the `table_exists` function is called with a table name that has a different case than what is returned by the Hive command.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing due to the case sensitivity of the table name comparison.
4. The related GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
5. The bug occurs because the function is comparing the table name directly without taking into account the case differences between the expected table name and the one returned by the Hive command.
6. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to convert both the expected table name and the one from the Hive command to a consistent case (e.g., lower case) before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lower case before comparison.
2. Use lower case transformation for both the expected `table` name and the table names returned by Hive commands.
3. Update the function to return `True` if the lowercase `table` name is found in the lowercase `stdout`, else return `False`.

### Updated Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the table name comparison case insensitive in the `table_exists` function, we ensure that the function behaves correctly even if the case of the table names differs between the expected name and the one returned by Hive commands.
