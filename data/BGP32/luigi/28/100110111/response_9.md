The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The function is not handling the case of the table name properly, leading to incorrect results in the test cases. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive.

To address the issue, we should modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive and aligns with the expectations outlined in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive in the corrected function, the test cases outlined above will now pass successfully. The corrected function aligns with the expectations for the input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
