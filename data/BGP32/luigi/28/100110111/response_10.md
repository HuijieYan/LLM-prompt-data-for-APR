### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` has a logic issue with case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` is trying to validate the correctness of the `table_exists` function and is failing due to case sensitivity issues.
3. The expected input/output values for the function are provided for different scenarios.
4. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking if a table exists in Hive.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and the result from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Justification:
1. The bug fix modifies the `table_exists` function by converting both `table` and the result from `stdout` to lowercase before checking if the table exists.
2. This change ensures a case-insensitive comparison, resolving the issue of failing tests due to case sensitivity problems.
3. The bug fix aligns with the suggested strategy of making the comparison case insensitive, addressing the root cause of the bug.
4. With this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values provided.
