Based on the provided information, the buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file of the `luigi` package has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. The issue has been identified in GitHub as #896, indicating the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when checking for table existence, where the function does not handle case sensitivity properly.
2. The failing test cases check the function behavior with different table names and partitions, which reveal the bug.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when checking for table existence with case differences due to a lack of case insensitivity handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison logic between the table name and the output from Hive. By converting both to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure the check is not case sensitive.

### Updated & Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, this corrected version ensures that the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive and should pass all the expected test cases mentioned earlier.

After applying this fix and running the failing test cases, the corrected function should properly handle case insensitivity for checking table existence in Hive, resolving the bug reported in GitHub issue #896.
