### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is currently case-sensitive when comparing the table name with the tables in the Hive database. This causes the test cases to fail when the table names have different cases. The error messages indicate that the assertion for the table existence is failing due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling the case sensitivity of the table names correctly. The function does not convert the table name to lowercase for comparison with the tables retrieved from Hive. This results in false negatives when searching for tables.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will make the function case-insensitive and ensure that the test cases pass as expected.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.splitlines()
        return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `t` to lowercase when comparing in the `if` condition, the function becomes case-insensitive for table names. This fix addresses the bug and ensures that the test cases pass successfully.
