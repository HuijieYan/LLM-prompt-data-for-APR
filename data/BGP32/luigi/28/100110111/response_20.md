### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is checking for table existence using different casing of table names.
3. The bug causes the function to fail the test when the casing of the table name in Hive differs from the casing used in the function's input.
4. To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the tables returned in `stdout`.
5. The fix should address the case sensitivity issue to align with the expected behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling case sensitivity when comparing the table names retrieved from Hive's `show tables` and the table name provided as input. When the casing does not match exactly, the function fails to detect the table's existence as expected based on the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert the table names (both input and from `stdout`) to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence, aligning with the expected behavior specified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the tables retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the bug.
