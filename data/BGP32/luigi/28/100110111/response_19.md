### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a bug when comparing the table name retrieved from Hive with the input table name. The function is case-sensitive, which causes the test cases to fail.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` mocks the `run_hive_cmd` function and tests the `table_exists` method with different scenarios.
3. The failing test raises an AssertionError because the buggy function does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function's direct comparison of the table name retrieved from Hive with the input table name without considering case sensitivity. This leads to failing test cases as the table names might have different casings.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the retrieved table names and the input table name to lowercase before comparison. This approach ensures a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout
```

By converting both `table` and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This update should address the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue specified in the GitHub bug reports.
