### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a database partition. The bug occurs when checking if the table name is in the output from running a Hive command. The function fails to handle case sensitivity correctly.
2. The bug is likely in the comparison logic where `table` is checked against `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug arises due to the direct comparison of the table name and the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. This results in assertions failing when the case of the table name does not match the output.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output should be case-insensitive, allowing for a more reliable check.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function table_exists
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By lowering both the `table` and `stdout` when comparing them, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence.
