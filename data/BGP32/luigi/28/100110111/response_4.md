## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The bug seems to stem from the case sensitivity of the table names causing the tests to fail.
2. The bug occurs when the function compares the table name to the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug causes the test cases to fail when the table names are not in the exact same case as returned by the Hive command output. The error message indicates an assertion failure because the function incorrectly returns `False` when it should return `True` due to the case insensitivity issue.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them.
5. The corrected version of the function will address the case sensitivity issue and ensure that the tests pass as expected.

## Code Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function addresses the case insensitivity issue and ensures that the tests pass successfully.
