The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences, leading to failing tests when the case does not match.

To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the issue raised in GitHub regarding case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
