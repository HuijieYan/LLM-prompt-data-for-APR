To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name to the output from Hive. The current implementation simply checks if the table name is in the output, which leads to failures when the case doesn't match.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function `table_exists` not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table name to the output from Hive.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected function for table_exists
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using this corrected version of the function, we ensure that the table name comparison is case insensitive, which will make the function pass all the test cases, including those mentioned in the failing test and the expected values provided.
