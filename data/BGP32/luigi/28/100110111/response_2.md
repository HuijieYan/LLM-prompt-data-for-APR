### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has an issue where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for table existence.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is aimed at checking the `table_exists` function but encounters an error due to incorrect handling of case sensitivity.
3. The error message indicates that for the test case where the table name is 'MyTable', the function returns `False` instead of `True`.
4. The suggested strategy to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
5. A corrected version of the `table_exists` function is needed to pass the failing test and handle case insensitivity correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the content in `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` are converted to lowercase before checking for existence.
2. By comparing the lowercase versions of the `table` name and the content in `stdout`, case sensitivity issues are resolved.
3. The corrected function now properly handles case sensitivity and satisfies the expected input/output values for the test cases.
4. The issue mentioned in GitHub about making `table_exists` case insensitive is addressed by this correction.
