After analyzing the buggy function and failing test, it is clear that the issue stems from a case sensitivity problem when checking for table existence in Hive. The function `table_exists` should account for case sensitivity and compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the table names retrieved from Hive. By converting both table names to lowercase before comparing, we can ensure a case-insensitive check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()
```

By converting both the table name and the tables retrieved from Hive to lowercase, we can perform a case-insensitive comparison. This change should ensure that the function works correctly for all test cases provided and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

This correction should address the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
