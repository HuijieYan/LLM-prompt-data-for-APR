Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` method is due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The function is not handling case-insensitivity correctly, leading to failed tests. To resolve this issue, we need to modify the function to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function:
1. We fetch all the table names from the database using `show tables`, convert them to lowercase, and then check if the lowercase version of the table name is in the list of tables retrieved.
2. We compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the input table name and the table names retrieved from the database to lowercase before checking existence.

This modification will ensure that the `table_exists` function is case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. The corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
