### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive query and then checks if the table is present in the output.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the output with the input table name.
3. The failing test case demonstrates that when the table name is provided in a different case (e.g., `'MyTable'` instead of `'mytable'`), the function fails to return the correct result due to case sensitivity issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the input table name and the output table names to lowercase before comparison.
2. Implement this case-insensitive comparison in both branches of the `if` condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the input table name and the output table names to lowercase in the `table_exists` function, we can ensure the comparison is case-insensitive. This corrected version should resolve the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases while also addressing the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity.
