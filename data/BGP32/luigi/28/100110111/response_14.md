### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it checks for the existence of a table in a case-sensitive manner, leading to test failures when the table names are different only in case. The error message indicates that the function is returning False instead of True in the case-insensitive check scenario.

The function has two code paths based on the presence of the `partition` parameter, each returning different results. The bug lies in the comparison between the `table` name and the names retrieved from the `stdout`. The expected behavior is to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing table names with the output from `stdout`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a case-sensitive comparison operation in the function `table_exists`. When the input table name and the name retrieved from the stdout differ only in case, the function fails to recognize the table's existence.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the comparisons between the table names and the names retrieved from the `stdout` to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the `table` parameter is converted to lowercase before being compared against the table names retrieved from `stdout`. This change ensures that the comparison is now case-insensitive, fixing the bug.

By implementing this fix, the function `table_exists` will pass all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
