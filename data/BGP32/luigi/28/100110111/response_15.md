### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file checks if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. The function fails to handle case sensitivity correctly.
2. The error occurs when the function compares the table name (or partition) from the Hive output against the provided table name without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing test case `test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists` checks if the `table_exists` function can correctly identify the existence of a table, including case insensitivity. The error message indicates that the function fails to return the correct result.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name from the output and the provided table name should be case-insensitive, ensuring that the function can accurately determine table existence without being affected by case differences.
5. The corrected version of the function will include a modification to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner to address the bug.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Modified line for case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison of table names to be case-insensitive using `lower()`, the corrected function can accurately determine table existence regardless of the case of the provided table name. This change will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue #896 and ensure that the failing test cases pass as expected.
