The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name in the `stdout` from Hive. This results in failing test cases where the table name casing doesn't match exactly.

To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lower case before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and `stdout` to lower case during comparison, the function should now pass all test cases and handle case insensitivity correctly. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue, where the function should be case insensitive.

This corrected version satisfies all the expected input/output values for the test cases provided.
