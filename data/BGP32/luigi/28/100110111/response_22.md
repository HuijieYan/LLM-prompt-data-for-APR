To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` method to make it case-insensitive while checking if the table exists in the Hive output. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the comparison is not affected by case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the tables listed in the Hive output.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided and satisfy the expected input/output values. It also addresses the GitHub issue regarding making the `table_exists` method case-insensitive.
