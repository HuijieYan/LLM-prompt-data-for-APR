### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. The issue lies in the comparison of the table name within the stdout. The failing test in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` highlights the problem when the table name's case sensitivity is not handled properly, leading to assertion errors.

The failing test specifically checks the behavior of the function `table_exists` with different input parameters and expects the correct output based on those parameters. The failing test provides clear cases where the buggy function is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. In the first block of the `if` condition where the table name comparison is not case-insensitive.
2. In the else block where the partition is processed, potentially leading to incorrect comparison behavior.

### Cause of the bug
The bug arises when the table name in the stdout is not compared in a case-insensitive manner, causing assertion errors in scenarios where the table names have different casing than what is checked within the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output from stdout to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we can ensure a consistent approach to checking for table existence, regardless of the casing.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name (`table`) and the output from `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.
