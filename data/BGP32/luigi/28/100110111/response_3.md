The bug in the function `table_exists` arises due to the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function is currently comparing the exact table name with the tables listed in the stdout, leading to failures when the case doesn't match.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function will pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
