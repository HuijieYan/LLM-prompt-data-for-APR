### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a given table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the stdout response from Hive. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling case insensitivity properly. The expected behavior is that the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout output.

### Issues:
1. The function does not perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout output.
2. The bug causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence in a case-insensitive manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function directly compares the table name with the stdout output without considering the case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the table names differ in case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `table_exists` should convert both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                               (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase in the `table_exists` function, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, which will fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test cases.
