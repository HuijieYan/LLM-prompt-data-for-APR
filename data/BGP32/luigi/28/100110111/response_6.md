The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the hive command. The function is currently checking for an exact match which causes failures in tests where the table names have different case forms.

The fix involves converting both the table name and the output from the hive command to lowercase for comparison. This change will make the comparison case insensitive and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the failing test and the related GitHub issue. This corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
