## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a bug where it doesn't handle case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive. This bug leads to test failures as shown in the failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`.

When the test code tries to create a table "MyTable" and checks for its existence with the table_exists function, the function fails to recognize it due to case sensitivity issues. The function doesn't consider case-insensitive comparisons, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `table_exists` doesn't handle case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive. In the failing test case for "MyTable", the function expects the table to exist but fails due to a case mismatch. This behavior results in the assertion error.

The bug arises from the fact that the function compares the table name exactly as provided without considering case-insensitive comparisons.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the provided table name and the retrieved table names to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the case sensitivity issue:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will perform case-insensitive comparisons, resolving the issue of failing tests due to case sensitivity problems.
