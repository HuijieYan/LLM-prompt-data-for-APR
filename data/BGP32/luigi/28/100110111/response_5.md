### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has an issue where it directly compares the table name with the stdout, which leads to case sensitivity problems.
2. The failing test in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` highlights the issue by testing table existence with different letter cases.
3. The failing test shows that the function is case sensitive, leading to assertion errors when comparing table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we handle case insensitivity by comparing the table names in lower case.
5. The corrected function should compare the lower case version of the table name with the lower case version of stdout to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Summary:
The correction involves converting both the table name and stdout to lower case before comparison to make the check case insensitive. This change addresses the reported case sensitivity issue with table existence checks in the Hive module of Luigi.
