The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called to execute the Hive command. There are formatting issues in constructing the Hive command string when `partition` is not None, which results in incorrect command execution.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the Hive command string based on whether `partition` is None or not. Also, we need to ensure that the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function is properly checked and handled.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the Hive command string is properly formatted based on the value of `partition`. The return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function is explicitly converted to a boolean using `bool(stdout)`, ensuring a consistent boolean return value from the function.
