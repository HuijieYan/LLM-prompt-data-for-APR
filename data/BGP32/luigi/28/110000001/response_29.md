## Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a database using hive commands. There are a few potential error locations in the function:
- The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might not work as intended if `stdout` is empty.
- The string formatting in the else block is incorrect since `partition_spec(partition)` is not defined within the function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function lies in the incorrect use of the `stdout` variable to check for table existence and the improper string formatting in the else block.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition for checking table existence to handle the case where `stdout` is empty and correct the string formatting in the else block by defining the `partition_spec` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            if partition_spec:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec))
                return True if stdout else False
            else:
                return False
```
