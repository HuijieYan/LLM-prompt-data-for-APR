## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a given table exists in the specified database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine the existence of the table.

### Potential Errors:
1. In the first `if` block, the `run_hive_cmd` function is used to execute a Hive command to check for the table existence in the default database. However, the logic of checking for the table existence is not handled correctly.
2. In the `else` block, when a partition is specified, the Hive command logic is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results in determining the table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is caused by incorrect handling of the Hive commands and the logic that checks for table existence based on the output of these commands. The incorrect usage of the `run_hive_cmd` function and improper formatting of Hive commands lead to incorrect results in determining the existence of tables.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly format the Hive command to check for table existence in both scenarios.
2. Validate the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine the existence of the table.
3. Ensure that the logic for checking table existence is consistent and accurate in both cases (with and without partition).

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout.split()
```

In the corrected version:
1. The Hive commands are correctly formatted based on the scenario of checking table existence.
2. The output of `run_hive_cmd` is split and checked for the presence of the table name to determine its existence.
3. The logic for determining table existence in both cases (with and without partition) is consistent and accurate.
