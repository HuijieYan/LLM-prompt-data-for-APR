The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. The function `run_hive_cmd` is used to execute Hive commands and capture the output. However, the way the output is being checked for existence of the table is causing issues.

The bug in the code is related to how the stdout is being checked for table existence. The current implementation checks if `stdout` is not empty and then checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, which is not the correct way to verify table existence. The correct way to check for table existence is to parse the output of the Hive command and check if the specific table is present in the result set.

To fix this bug, you can update the `table_exists` function to properly parse the output of the Hive commands to check for table existence. You can modify the function as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, when checking for table existence without a partition, the function uses `show tables in {database}` command to show all tables in the database and then checks if the specified `table` is in the list of tables. When checking for table existence with a partition, the function simply checks if the `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists.

These modifications should fix the bug in the `table_exists` function and ensure that it correctly verifies the existence of tables in the Hive database.
