## Analysis:
The `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class is buggy. It checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database, with an optional partition. The bug seems to be related to how the 'partition' parameter is handled in the function.

## Identified potential error locations:
The issue lies in how the `partition` parameter is used within the function. When the `partition` parameter is provided, the function generates a Hive command using string formatting. This can lead to incorrect formatting of the Hive command, resulting in the function not functioning as intended.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `partition` parameter when constructing the Hive command in the `table_exists` function. String formatting may not be producing the expected Hive command when a partition is involved, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the Hive command is correctly formatted when the `partition` parameter is provided. Instead of using string formatting directly, we should construct the Hive command properly by separating the parts of the command and joining them correctly.

## Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the Hive command construction for when the `partition` parameter is provided has been modified to use proper string formatting to ensure the correct generation of the Hive command. The `bool` function has been used to simplify the return statement and ensure a consistent return type.
