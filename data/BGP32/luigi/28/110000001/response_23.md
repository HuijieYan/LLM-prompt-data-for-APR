## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses a condition to determine whether a table exists in a database. However, there are errors in the condition checking logic that lead to incorrect results.

## Identified Issues:
1. The condition for checking if `stdout` is not empty and the `table` exists within it is incorrect. It should compare the table name directly rather than checking if it's in the stdout string.
2. In the `else` block, the `run_hive_cmd` command is forming a query string with incorrect formatting for the `show partitions` command.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect comparison of the table name with the stdout string and incorrect formatting of the query string for `show partitions` command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the condition to directly check if the table name matches the stdout value.
2. Correct the formatting of the query string for the `show partitions` command.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- The first condition checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` directly.
- The second condition fixes the formatting of the `show partitions` command query string.
