## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check if the table/partition exists.
3. There are potential issues with the Hive command formatting and the conditional checks in the function.
4. The bug is likely caused by incorrect formatting of the Hive command in the else block and the conditional checks not handling the output properly.


## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the Hive command formatting is correct for checking table existence and partitions.
2. Modify the conditional checks to handle the output more accurately.
3. Refactor the function to improve readability and maintainability.


## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```


In the corrected version:
1. Used proper string formatting for Hive commands in both cases.
2. Changed the conditional checks to handle the output more accurately by checking if the table/partition exists in the output.
3. Improved readability and consistency in the function.
