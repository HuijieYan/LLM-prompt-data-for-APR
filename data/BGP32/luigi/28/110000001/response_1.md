## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` may not work as expected.
2. The formatting of the Hive command string in the `else` block is incorrect and may lead to errors.
3. The logic to return `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` value can be simplified.

## Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function's `table_exists` has issues in checking the existence of a table due to incorrect logic in handling the output of the Hive commands. The conditions used to return `True` or `False` based on the `stdout` content are not properly implemented, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the output by splitting the `stdout` using newlines.
2. Correctly format the Hive command string in the `else` block to show partition information.
3. Simplify the logic to directly return the condition based on the presence of `stdout`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Check if the table name is present in the newline-separated output for table existence.
- Properly format the Hive command string in the `else` block for partition information.
- Simplify the return logic based on the presence of `stdout`.

These changes address the identified issues and improve the functionality of the `table_exists` function.
