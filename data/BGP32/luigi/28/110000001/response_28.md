The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a database. There are two potential error locations in the function:
1. The formatting of the Hive command string in the `else` block may not be correct.
2. The condition to check the existence of the table in the output may not be handling the response properly.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect formatting of the Hive command string in the `else` block, and the condition to check for the existence of the table in the output may not be evaluating correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command string is formatted correctly in both branches of the `if` statement, and we need to properly handle the response to determine if the table exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return "No such partition" not in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- Used .split() after reading the stdout to check if the table name is present in the table list.
- Fixed the formatting of the Hive command string in the `else` block.
- Updated the condition to properly check for the existence of the table/partition in the output.

These changes should fix the bug in the `table_exists` function.
