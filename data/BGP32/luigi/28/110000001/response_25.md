## Correction:

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has two potential error locations:

1. In the `else` part of the function, the `stdout` variable is assigned the result of running a Hive command, but the condition to check if the table exists is missing. This means that even if the command runs successfully, the function will always return `True` regardless of whether the table exists or not.

2. In the `else` part, there is a missing closing parenthesis in the `run_hive_cmd` call which can cause a syntax error.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check the existence of the table in both branches of the function and ensure the Hive command syntax is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout) # returning the boolean value directly

```

In this corrected version, we properly check the existence of the table in both branches of the function and fix the syntax error in the Hive command. Also, we simplify the `if` condition in the `return` statement of the first branch to directly return a boolean value.
