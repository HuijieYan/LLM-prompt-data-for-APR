## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The function uses `hive` invocations to run commands and determine the existence of a table.

## Identified Issues:
The main issue in the buggy function is with the second part of the function where it tries to show partitions. There are issues with the formatting of the command string.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function is called with incorrect command formatting for showing partitions in a database. This leads to incorrect detection of table existence when partitions are involved.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the command string for showing partitions is properly formatted with the correct placeholders and values before passing it to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, the command string for showing partitions is properly formatted with placeholders for database, table, and partition values. This ensures that the correct command is passed to `run_hive_cmd` for checking the existence of the table with partitions.
