The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is causing errors because of potential issues with the `run_hive_cmd` function calls. The function is meant to check if a table exists in a database in Hive, but there are errors in how the queries are constructed and executed.

Here are the identified issues and a suggested strategy to fix the bug:
1. The query construction in the `else` block seems to be incorrect, it should be formatted properly to include the `partition` information.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function may not be handling the query execution and response retrieval correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the queries are constructed accurately and executed properly using the `run_hive_cmd` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Removed the unnecessary semicolon at the end of the query in the `if` block.
- Created a `partition_spec` variable to properly construct the partition information in the query in the `else` block.
- Removed unnecessary condition checks and simplified the return statement to directly return the boolean result of `stdout`.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly determine if a table exists in a database in Hive.
