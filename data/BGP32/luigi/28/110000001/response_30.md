## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database, with an optional partition. However, there are issues with the logic and formatting of the function that needs to be fixed.

## Bugs:
1. The first condition is checking if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which might not be a reliable way to determine table existence.
2. The second condition is attempting to check if the output of showing partitions is Truthy, which is incorrect. 

## Cause of Bugs:
1. The first bug is caused by not checking the format or content of the `run_hive_cmd` output properly, leading to potential false positives on table existence.
2. The second bug is caused by incorrectly checking the Truthiness of the `stdout`.

## Strategy for Bug Fixing:
1. Verify the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to ensure that it actually contains the necessary information to determine table existence.
2. Update the condition to properly check if the table exists in the output for the first condition.
3. Modify the second condition to check if the `stdout` contains any data to indicate the existence of the partitions.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Check if stdout has any data
