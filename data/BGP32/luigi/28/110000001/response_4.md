## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class

The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is a subclass of `HiveClient`. This class uses `hive` invocations to find information about tables and partitions in a database. The `table_exists` function is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

- The first conditional branch of the function is checking if `partition` is None and then using `run_hive_cmd` to execute a command. It then checks if the table exists in the output. This part seems fine.
- The second conditional branch is constructing a complex command string using old-style string formatting (`%s`) and then calling `run_hive_cmd` with this command. However, the way the command is constructed might be causing issues.
- The return statements in both branches are inconsistent: one uses a truthy check and one uses an explicit True/False return.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug in the function `table_exists` lies in the construction of the command string in the second conditional branch. The formatting using `%s` might not correctly create the command string, leading to a failure of the command execution. Additionally, the inconsistent return statements can lead to confusion and potential logical errors.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the command string is constructed correctly using the new-style string formatting or `str.format`. Additionally, we should make the return statements consistent to improve readability and maintainability.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})')
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We have used f-strings for string interpolation to construct the commands in a more readable and error-proof manner.
- We have made the return statements consistent, using the `bool()` function to explicitly convert the `stdout` to a boolean value.
- These changes should fix the bug in the `table_exists` function and make it more robust.
