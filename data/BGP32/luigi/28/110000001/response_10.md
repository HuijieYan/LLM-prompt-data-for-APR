## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses `hive` commands to perform this check.

## Identified Errors:
- The first part of the function seems correct, where it checks for table existence without a partition.
- The error seems to be in the else part of the function where it tries to check for the existence of a partition based on the input provided.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by incorrect formatting of the `show partitions` command. The way the `stdout` is being checked for truthiness may also impact the result.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the `stdout` variable captures the exact output of the `hive` command correctly, covering both the table existence and partition existence checks. 
- Properly construct the `show partitions` command so that it accurately queries for the desired information.
- Evaluate the condition for checking the existence of partitions and return the correct result based on the outcome of the `hive` command execution.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if the partitions exist
```

## Explanation:
- The corrected version makes sure that the `show partitions` command is properly formatted.
- Uses `partition_spec` to generate the partition specification.
- Correctly checks the existence of partitions by stripping the `stdout` output and checking if it's not empty.
- Returns the boolean result based on partition existence.

By applying these fixes, the buggy function should now correctly determine the existence of tables and partitions in the specified database.
