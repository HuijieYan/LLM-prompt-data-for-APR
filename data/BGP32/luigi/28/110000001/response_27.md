## Analysis:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expected to check if a table exists in a specified database in Hive. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.

## Identified Issues:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined within the scope of the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. In the else block of the function, the Hive command being executed to check table existence with the specified partition is incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the `run_hive_cmd` function is not defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class, leading to a NameError when trying to call it. Additionally, the Hive command in the else block is not correctly checking for table existence with a specific partition.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `run_hive_cmd` function or import it from the appropriate module.
2. Correct the Hive command in the else block to properly check for table existence with the specified partition.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```

In this corrected version, the `run_hive_cmd` function needs to be defined or imported correctly. The Hive command in the else block is fixed to check for table existence with a specified partition using the correct syntax. The return statement is updated to check if the `stdout` is not empty to determine the existence of the table with the specified partition.
