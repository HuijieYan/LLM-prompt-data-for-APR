## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses `hive` commands to find this information.

## Identified Errors:
1. In the condition `if partition is None`, the function executes a Hive command to check if the table exists based on the provided parameters. However, the condition for checking if the table exists in the output of the Hive command is not correctly implemented.
2. In the `else` block, when a partition is provided, the Hive command is constructed incorrectly, leading to potential errors in querying the table's existence.

## Cause of the Bug:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect implementation of the conditions for checking the existence of a table based on the output of the Hive commands. The function fails to accurately validate the presence of the table from the obtained output, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition for checking the presence of the table in the Hive command output is correctly implemented. Additionally, the construction of the Hive command to query the table's existence when a partition is provided needs to be adjusted for proper execution.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables like '{1}' partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout.strip() == table
```

In the corrected version, the `table_exists` function now correctly checks whether the specified table exists in the Hive database by comparing the table to the stripped output of the Hive command. The Hive command construction for checking table existence with partitions is also adjusted to handle the query format appropriately.
