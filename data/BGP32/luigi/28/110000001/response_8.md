The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has two issues:
1. The indentation within the `else` block is inconsistent, which can lead to incorrect execution flow.
2. The second query in the `else` block is missing the required table name.

To fix these issues:
1. For consistent code style and readability, use consistent indentation.
2. Include the `table` parameter in the query within the `else` block.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition (%s)""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise

```

By making these corrections, the `table_exists` function will now properly execute the query for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database.
