## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is meant to check if a table exists in the specified database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine if the table exists. There are potential issues with the string formatting and condition checks in the function.

## Identified Errors:
1. The first `run_hive_cmd` call does not use triple quotes for the query string.
2. In the `else` block, the `run_hive_cmd` call is missing the `partition` attribute within the formatted string.
3. The condition checks for whether the `stdout` value is not empty, which may not be sufficient for determining table existence.

## Bug Explanation:
The first bug arises from not using triple quotes for the query string, which may lead to syntax errors when executing the Hive command. The second bug is caused by missing the `partition` attribute in the specified Hive query string. The third bug arises from inadequately checking the `stdout` value, which may lead to incorrect results in determining table existence.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use triple quotes for the Hive query strings to prevent syntax errors.
2. Include the `partition` attribute in the Hive query string within the `else` block.
3. Check if the table name is present in the `stdout` output to determine table existence accurately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('''use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'''.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('''use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'''.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout
```
