## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in a Hive database. The function has two paths based on the presence of a `partition`. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and extract information.

## Identified Issues:
1. In the `else` block of the function, the `run_hive_cmd` command is not correctly constructed.
2. The condition for returning `True` or `False` based on the presence of `stdout` is redundant.

## Explanation:
The bug lies in the incorrect construction of the Hive command in the `else` block. The command is missing necessary parts and will not yield the desired output. Additionally, the function can be simplified by directly returning the evaluation of `stdout`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly construct the Hive command in the `else` block.
2. Simplify the function by directly returning the evaluation of `stdout`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('''use {0}; show partitions {1} partition 
                                ({2})'''.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the Hive command in the `else` block is correctly constructed using string formatting. Also, the evaluation of `stdout` is directly returned, eliminating unnecessary conditions.
