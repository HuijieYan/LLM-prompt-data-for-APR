## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function queries the database using Hive commands and checks the output to determine if the table exists.

## Potential error locations:
1. The string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` function calls may not be properly formatted.
2. The condition checking for the existence of the table may not be correctly implemented.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect string formatting in the queries sent to Hive. When formatting the SQL queries, the interpolation of variables may not be correct, leading to invalid queries being executed.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the string formatting for the SQL queries in both branches of the `if` statement.
2. Verify that the queries generated are valid and execute correctly when querying the Hive database.
3. Improve the conditional check for the existence of the table to handle the output from the Hive commands properly.

## Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""
                                use {0};
                                show partitions {1} partition ({2});
                                """.format(database, table, partition_query))
    
            return stdout is not None
    
```

In the corrected version:
- Fixed the string formatting in both branches of the `if` statement to generate valid SQL queries.
- Improved the conditional check for the existence of the table by returning the boolean value based on the output from the Hive commands.

By making these corrections, the `table_exists` function should now work correctly and accurately check the existence of a table in the Hive database.
