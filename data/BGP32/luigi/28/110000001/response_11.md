The buggy function `table_exists` has a potential error location in the `else` block where it runs the `run_hive_cmd` command with incorrect formatting. The `run_hive_cmd` command is constructed with triple quotes `"""` but does not include the correct formatting for `%s` placeholders. This can lead to errors in the query execution.

The buggy function is trying to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. The bug occurs in the else block where the query string is not formatted correctly with placeholders for database, table, and partition.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly format the query string in the `else` block to include the placeholders for database, table, and partition. Then execute the `run_hive_cmd` with the correct query string. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)' % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```
