## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database based on the provided parameters. The bug is likely in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is called and how the output is checked for existence of the table.

## Identified Issue:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called with improper formatting for the query when partition information is provided. This can lead to incorrect results when checking if a table exists.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `else` block of the function where the `run_hive_cmd` call is not correctly formatted to check if a partitioned table exists. The missing partition spec from the query can lead to false negative results.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to properly format the query when checking for partitioned tables. The query in the `else` block should include the partition specification to accurately check if the table exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}" partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version, the query for checking if a partitioned table exists includes the partition specification so that the check is done accurately. This fixes the bug in the original function.
