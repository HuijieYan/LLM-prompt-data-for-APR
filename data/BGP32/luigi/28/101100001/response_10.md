The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the way it checks for the presence of the table or partition in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The problem arises because the function does not properly parse the output from `run_hive_cmd` when checking for the existence of the table or partition.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` and ensure that it correctly identifies the existence of the table or partition.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and "OK" in stdout
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table or partition in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.

The failing test function should now pass with this corrected version of the `table_exists` function.
