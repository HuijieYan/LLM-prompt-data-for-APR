## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is using the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database.
2. The bug seems to be related to the way the function is checking for the existence of the table based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where `run_hive_cmd` returns multiple lines of output correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to handle multiple lines of output from the `run_hive_cmd`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Fix the buggy function table_exists
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            # Modified logic to handle multiple lines of output
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the logic to check if the `table` exists in any of the lines returned by `run_hive_cmd`, we can now properly handle cases where the function returns multiple lines of output.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
