## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class. It makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic in the `table_exists` function where it checks for the existence of a table in the specified database with optional partition.
3. The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a table with a partition. The function incorrectly constructs the Hive command query by not providing the correct partition specification, leading to failures in the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the partition specification is correctly handled and included in the Hive command query.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The bug-fixed version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        part_spec = ",".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, part_spec))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By correcting the way the partition specification is constructed and including it in the Hive command query, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
