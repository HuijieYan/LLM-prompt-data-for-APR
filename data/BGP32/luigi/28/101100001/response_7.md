### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The issue lies in how the function processes the stdout output from `run_hive_cmd` to determine if a table exists.
3. The bug is due to the incorrect comparison in the `if stdout:` block. The function is returning `True` if `stdout` is not empty, which is incorrect.
4. To fix this bug, we need to properly check if the table name is present in the stdout output.
5. Update the `if stdout:` block to check if the exact table name is present in the `stdout` instead of just checking if `stdout` is not empty.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, partition_spec_str))
            return table in stdout
``` 

By updating the `table_exists` function to correctly check if the table name is present in the `stdout`, the bug should be fixed and the provided failing test should now pass.
