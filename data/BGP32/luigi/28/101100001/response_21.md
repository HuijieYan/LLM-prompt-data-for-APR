## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expecting the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function to contain the table name in order to determine if the table exists. However, the comparison logic is incorrect, causing the failing test cases. The function is checking if `stdout` is Truthy and then checking if the table name is in it. This logic does not handle the case where the table name is listed along with other information in stdout.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the `table_exists` function where it checks for `table in stdout`. If stdout contains any data apart from the table name, the check fails.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly parse the `stdout` from `run_hive_cmd` and ensure that it correctly identifies the presence of the table name. We should parse the `stdout` line by line and compare each line separately with the table name.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By using the corrected version provided above, the function should now correctly identify if the table exists based on the parsed `stdout` output. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
