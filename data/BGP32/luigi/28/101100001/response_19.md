## Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not mocked in the test case, which causes the test to make actual calls to the command, affecting the test outcomes.
3. The issue lies in the way the `table_exists` function checks for table existence based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way it checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The condition to find the table's existence is flawed, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Mock the `run_hive_cmd` function in the test case to prevent actual execution of Hive commands.
2. Revise the logic of the `table_exists` function to accurately check for table existence based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            spec = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version updates the logic of the `table_exists` function to properly check for table existence and partition specifications. It also uses the correct Hive command syntax while handling partitions. Additionally, it removes unnecessary if-else statements for better readability and maintains consistency with the Hive commands.
