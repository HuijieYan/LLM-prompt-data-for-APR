The bug in the provided code is due to the incorrect comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The buggy function `table_exists` is returning `True` only if the exact table name is present in the output. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the table name is present in the output regardless of its position or case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Union

def table_exists(self, table: str, database: str = 'default', partition: Union[dict, None] = None) -> bool:
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)

```

In this corrected version, the comparison is done regardless of the case sensitivity of the table names. The function now checks if the table name is present in the output and returns `True` in that case.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
