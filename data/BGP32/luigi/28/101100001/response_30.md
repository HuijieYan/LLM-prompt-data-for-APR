## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a given database in Hive by running a hive command. If no partition is provided, it uses `show tables like` command, otherwise, it uses `show partitions` command.
2. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the hive commands.

## Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the stdout with the table name. If the `run_hive_cmd` function returns stdout without any newline characters, the comparison `table in stdout` fails. This is seen in the failing test where the function fails if no newline is present in the stdout. It also fails due to case sensitivity.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table name with the stdout to handle cases where there are no newline characters. We also need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner and handle cases where stdout may not contain newline characters. This version should pass the failing test.
