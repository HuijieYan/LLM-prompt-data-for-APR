The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition to check for the existence of the table. The function is returning `False` when it should return `True`, and vice versa. This is because the current logic checks for the absence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to properly check for the existence of the table instead.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout
```

By changing the logic to return the `stdout` directly for the partitioned case and checking if the table exists in the output for the non-partitioned case, we can fix the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
