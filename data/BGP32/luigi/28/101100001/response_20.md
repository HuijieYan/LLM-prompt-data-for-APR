The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the condition for checking if the `stdout` contains the table name. The function incorrectly checks if `stdout` is not empty to determine if the table exists, which can lead to incorrect results. 

To fix the bug, we should explicitly check if the table name is present in `stdout` instead of relying on its truthiness. 

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                              (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks if the table name is present in the output (`stdout`) from the Hive command and returns `True` if found, `False` otherwise. This change ensures that the function behaves correctly when determining if a table exists.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
