The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the condition is being checked when the command is executed. The function is checking if the `stdout` is truthy but in some cases, the `stdout` might contain whitespace characters or newlines, which make the comparison fail.

To fix this bug, we need to strip any whitespace characters or newlines from the `stdout` before comparing it to the `table` name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                            ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will strip any leading or trailing whitespace characters before comparing `table` with `stdout`, ensuring a proper comparison.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
