The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition checks for the existence of the table being incorrect. The condition checks are based on the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition checks to ensure that the table name appears as a distinct entity in the output rather than just as a substring. This can be achieved by splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` based on newline characters ("\n") and then checking if the table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this modification, the `table_exists` function should now correctly check for the existence of the specified table and pass the failing test cases.
