The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the comparison check for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function should only return True if the table name is an exact match with the table name in the output, currently it's checking if the table name is contained in the output which may lead to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:

1. In the case where `partition` is `None`, the output of `run_hive_cmd` is split by newline character `\n`, and then the exact match of the table name is checked in the list of tables. This ensures that the table name is an exact match and not just contained in the output.

2. In the case where `partition` is not `None`, we directly return whether the `stdout` is truthy or not without any validation of the table name as it's not necessary in this case.

With these corrections, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
