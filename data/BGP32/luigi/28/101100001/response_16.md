## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is incorrectly implementing the check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue arises from how the function processes the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect results.

## Identified Error:
1. The condition `if stdout:` in the buggy function always evaluates to `True` because the `stdout` variable is always set to a non-empty string (due to the way `run_hive_cmd` is mocked).
2. The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when the table is not found in the Hive database because it only checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function returns true even when the table does not exist in the database because it only checks for the table name in the `stdout` output. This flawed logic results in failing the test cases where the table does not exist.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to properly handle the case when the table is not found in the Hive database. We should check if the table name is specifically present in the `stdout` output and return `False` in such cases.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the conditional check in the `table_exists` function to accurately verify the presence of the table name in the `stdout` output and handle the case when the table does not exist, we ensure the correct behavior of the function and pass the failing test cases.
