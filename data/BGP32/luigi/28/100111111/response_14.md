To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for existence. This will address the issue where the table names are in different cases causing the test to fail.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue, resolving the failing tests.

The corrected function now satisfies all the expected input/output values and addresses the GitHub issue related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
