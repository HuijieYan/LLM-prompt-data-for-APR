To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make it case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The current implementation is case sensitive, causing the test to fail when comparing tables with different case formats.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in GitHub and making the function more robust against different table name formats.

This correction should address the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values specified earlier.
