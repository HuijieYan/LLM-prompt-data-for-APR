Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function fails when the table name is in a different case than how it is returned by the Hive command. To fix this bug, the comparison should be case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison.
- The `stdout.lower()` is used to convert the output from the Hive command to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- The `bool(stdout)` is used to check if `stdout` is not empty and return a boolean value accordingly.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function will now perform case-insensitive comparisons between the table name and the output from the Hive command, resolving the issue with failing tests related to case sensitivity. The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
