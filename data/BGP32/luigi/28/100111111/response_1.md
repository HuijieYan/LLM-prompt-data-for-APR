Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `hive.py` file is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name against the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. To fix this bug as suggested in the GitHub issue #896, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for a match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing both `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`, the function will now perform a case-insensitive check for table existence.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided and align with the expected input/output values.
