To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the tables returned by the Hive command. The current implementation checks for an exact match, which causes failures when there is a case difference in the table names.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug arises when the table name case differs between the input and the output from the Hive command. The function checks for an exact match between the table name and the tables returned by the command, leading to failures when there is a case difference. The failing test cases show this discrepancy, causing the assertion errors.

To fix this bug, we should convert both the table name and the tables returned by the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected version, we convert both the table name and the tables returned by the Hive command to lowercase before performing the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check. This modification should resolve the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
