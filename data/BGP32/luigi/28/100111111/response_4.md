## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The issue arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which may not match due to case differences.
3. The failing test cases highlight the discrepancies in the expected and actual values returned by the function, leading to assertion errors.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output needs to be made case-insensitive.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug and address the case sensitivity issue in table existence checks, the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output should be done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase, the comparison becomes case-insensitive, addressing the bug and ensuring that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
