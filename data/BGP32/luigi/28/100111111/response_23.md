### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `table_exists` fails to handle case sensitivity properly when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. This causes the failing tests to produce incorrect results and lead to assertion errors.

In the failing tests, the function `table_exists` is called with various tables, including instances where the case of the table name differs from the expected case. Since the function does not account for case sensitivity, it fails to correctly identify the table existence based on the provided inputs.

For instance, when checking if the table `"MyTable"` exists, the function should consider case insensitivity and match it with the lowercase version of the table name, but it doesn't do that.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure that the function `table_exists` correctly handles case sensitivity when checking for table existence, we need to modify the comparison logic. By converting both the table name and the output table names to lowercase before comparison, we can make the check case-insensitive and ensure accurate results.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version:
- The table names are converted to lowercase using `table.lower()` before comparison with the output from Hive, which is also converted to lowercase using `stdout.lower()`.
- This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the bug and allowing the function to correctly determine table existence in Hive databases.

After applying this fix, rerunning the failing tests should now pass without any assertion errors, resolving the issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
