The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file needs to be fixed to address the case sensitivity issue. The function is failing the test due to the case sensitivity differences between the table name and the output from Hive.
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the `stdout` and the `table` name to lowercase when comparing them. This modification addresses the case-insensitivity issue and ensures that the test cases will pass as expected.

The correction aligns with the GitHub issue that was raised (#896) and provides a solution for making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

By implementing this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values.
