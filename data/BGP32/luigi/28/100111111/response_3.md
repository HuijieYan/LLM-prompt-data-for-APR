The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the `stdout`. This causes the failing tests to produce incorrect results as they expect case-insensitive comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout` output. This change will make the comparison case-insensitive and align with the expected results of the failing tests mentioned above.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                             (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the table names lowercase for comparison, the corrected function will now pass the failing tests and ensure case-insensitive behavior as expected by the test cases.
