To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. The issue arises when comparing the table name from the command output to the provided table name, as the table names can have different cases but should still be considered equal in this context.

Here's a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name and the table names from the command output to lowercase during comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and addresses the failing tests' expectations.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in `table_exists` function in the Hive integration of Luigi.
