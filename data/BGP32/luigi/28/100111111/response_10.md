To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command case-insensitive. Currently, the function directly checks if the `table` variable is in the `stdout` variable, leading to case sensitivity issues. We should modify the comparison to be case-insensitive by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison.

Here is the modified and corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to a common case (in this case, lowercase) before comparing them, we ensure that the comparison is now case-insensitive, addressing the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

The corrected `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison between the expected table name and the retrieved table names from the Hive command output. This modification ensures that the function passes the failing tests and fulfills the expected input/output values.
