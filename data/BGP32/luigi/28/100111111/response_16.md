To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. Currently, the function checks if the table name is exactly present in the stdout, which causes the failing tests due to case sensitivity.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we lowercase both the table name and the lines in the stdout before checking if the table exists. This change makes the comparison case insensitive, and it should pass the failing tests.

By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
