The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking whether a table exists in Hive. The function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to ensure that it works correctly with different letter cases.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is comparing the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which may not match if the cases are different. This leads to the assertion errors in the failing tests where the table names have different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues and should pass the failing tests.
