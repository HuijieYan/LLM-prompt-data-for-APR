Here is the corrected version of the buggy function based on the analysis and expected input/output values:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# the corrected function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase, the function now correctly handles case-insensitive comparisons, which addresses the issue raised in the GitHub threads.

This correction ensures that the function behaves consistently with case sensitivity in Hive queries, and it should pass the failing test cases provided.
