To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the output case-insensitive. Currently, the function is doing a direct comparison, which results in discrepancies with case-sensitive table names.

Let's modify the function to convert both the table name and the tables listed in the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this modification, the function will convert both the table name and the tables listed in the output to lowercase, allowing for a case-insensitive comparison. This change should address the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the reported GitHub issue.

Make sure to test the function with the provided test cases to ensure that it passes all of them successfully.
