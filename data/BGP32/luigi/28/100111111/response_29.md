## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function should be case insensitive when comparing the table names with the output from Hive. The failing test cases provide inputs where the table names are in different cases than the expected output from Hive. The function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the buggy function not accounting for case sensitivity when comparing the table names with the output from Hive. The function directly compares the names without converting them to the same case (lowercase).

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both names to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking if a table exists in Hive. This correction addresses the bug and enables the function to pass the failing test cases.
