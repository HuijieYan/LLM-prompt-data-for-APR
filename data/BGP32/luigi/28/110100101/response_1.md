### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a given table exists in a specified database. However, there are issues in the way it processes the input parameters and validates the output. The main bugs are found in the conditionals and the comparison logic of the function.

### Bug
The main bug in the function lies in the comparison of the output `stdout` with the table name. In one case, it checks if the table name is in the `stdout`, and in another case, it simply checks if `stdout` is not empty. This leads to unexpected behavior, especially in the case where multiple tables are returned in `stdout`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the returned stdout contains the exact table name when partition is None.
2. When partition is provided, check if the partition string (including the table name) is present in the stdout.
3. To address the case sensitivity issue, convert both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
from luigi.contrib.hive import HiveClient

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
        else:
            partition_str = "partition %s" % self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s %s""" % (database, table, partition_str))
            return partition_str.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

Now, the corrected function accurately checks if the table (and partition if provided) exists in the stdout by converting both to lowercase for easy comparison. This approach should address the buggy behavior and align with the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.
