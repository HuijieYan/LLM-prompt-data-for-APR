## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has two main issues:
1. In the else block, there is a missing formatting placeholder for `self.partition_spec(partition)` which is causing incorrect command formation.
2. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. It should check if `table` is present in the lines from `stdout` instead.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the else block, the missing formatting placeholder for `self.partition_spec(partition)` is causing the partition information to be incorrectly concatenated with the command, leading to incorrect query execution.
2. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` incorrectly checks if `stdout` is not empty and the `table` equals `stdout`. This condition is incorrect because `stdout` contains lines of tables, not just the table itself.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add a formatting placeholder for `self.partition_spec(partition)` in the else block to correctly include the partition information in the command.
2. Modify the condition `stdout and table in stdout` to loop over the lines in `stdout` and check if the `table` is present in any of the lines.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return any(table in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the issues in the original function are resolved, and it should pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
