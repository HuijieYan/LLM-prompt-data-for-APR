### Analysis
The `table_exists` function within the `HiveCommandClient` class checks the existence of a table in a database using `hive` invocations. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run queries against the hive database and checks the output to determine if the table exists. The bug is related to the conditional logic in the function. When checking for the existence of a table without a specific partition, the function compares the table name in the output, while when checking with a partition, it only checks for a non-empty output.

### Bug Cause
The bug exists in the conditional statements of the `table_exists` function:
1. When `partition` is `None`, the function returns `table in stdout`.
2. When `partition` is not `None`, the function simply checks if `stdout` has a Truthy value.

The bug causes incorrect behavior when checking for tables with partitions, as it does not appropriately verify the existence of the specified table along with the partition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `table_exists` function to ensure that it correctly checks for the existence of the table, considering partitions when provided. We need to compare the table name along with the partition specifications in the hive output when a partition is specified.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_cmd))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version, the function now constructs the appropriate query string to include the partition specifications when checking the existence of a table with partitions. It compares the table name along with the partition information in the hive output for accurate verification.
