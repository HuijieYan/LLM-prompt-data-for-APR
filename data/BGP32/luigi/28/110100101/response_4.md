### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the returned stdout is being handled. The function returns `True` if stdout is not empty and the table is found in the stdout, but it does not correctly handle the condition if the table is not found.

### Issue
The bug arises from the fact that the function does not return `False` if the table is not found in the stdout when a partition is provided.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to check if the table is present in the `stdout` and return `True` in that case. If the table is not found or the `stdout` is empty, we should return `False`.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

By adding `and table in stdout` to the return statements in both cases, we ensure that the function returns `True` only if the table is found in the `stdout`. If the table is not found or the `stdout` is empty, the function will correctly return `False`.
