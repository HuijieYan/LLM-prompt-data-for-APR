### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a table exists in a Hive database, using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistent handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the presence of a table based on the `stdout` value returned from the `run_hive_cmd`. In some cases, the function is not correctly parsing the `stdout` output, leading to incorrect results.

### Error Location:
The error seems to be in how the function is handling the `stdout` variable when checking for table existence.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first `if` block, the function assumes that the `stdout` will only contain the table name if the table exists in the database. This assumption is incorrect as `stdout` might contain additional information as well.
2. In the second `else` block, the function checks if `stdout` exists and returns `True` if it does. This check is insufficient as the `run_hive_cmd` function could output an empty string in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly parse the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Instead of relying on the presence of the table name in the `stdout`, we should check for the presence of the table name in a more robust manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        # Update the condition to check if the table name is in the stdout
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        # Update the condition to check if the stdout is not empty
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on whitespaces and checking if the table name is in the resulting list, we are ensuring a more reliable check for table existence. Additionally, we modified the condition to return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, instead of simply checking for its presence. This should make the function more robust and correctly identify the existence of tables in the Hive database.
