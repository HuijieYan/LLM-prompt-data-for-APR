The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case where the table name is found in the output correctly. It should check if the table name is in stdout after splitting the lines. The current implementation only checks if stdout exists or not.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to split the stdout by lines and then check if the table name is in the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the table_exists function

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will split the `stdout` by lines and then check if the table name is present in the lines, instead of just checking if `stdout` is not empty.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided previously.
