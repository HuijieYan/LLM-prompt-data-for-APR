### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a Hive table exists by running a hive command. The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking for the existence of the table.
2. The bug is in the logic that checks the return of the `run_hive_cmd` function call. The function is returning `True` if the output is not empty, but it should return `True` only if the table name is in the output.
3. The bug is causing the function to sometimes return `True` even when the table does not exist in the output of the hive command.
4. To fix the bug, the function should check if the table name is in the output in the case where the output is not empty.
5. The corrected version of the function should match the expected input/output values given in the expected cases provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the conditional check in the else part of the function to look for the table name within each line of the output separately, the corrected version should now pass all the expected test cases.
