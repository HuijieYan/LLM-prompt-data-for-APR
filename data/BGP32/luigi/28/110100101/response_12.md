### Analyzing the buggy function

1. The function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run hive commands and then checks the output to determine if the table exists.
   
2. There are two branches in this function:
   - If `partition` is None, it constructs a hive command to show tables like the input `table`.
   - If `partition` is not None, it constructs a hive command to show partitions of the input `table`.

### Identifying potential errors

1. The function does not handle case-sensitivity in table names. It assumes a direct comparison of the table names from the output, which might fail based on the case of the table name.
2. The logic inside the `if stdout` condition can be simplified by returning the `stdout` value directly.

### Cause of the bug

The bug in the function lies in the comparison of the table names directly from the `stdout`, which may fail due to case sensitivity. The function does not consider the need for case-insensitive comparison.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison check to be case-insensitive. We can convert both the `table` and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them to make the comparison case-insensitive.
- We directly return `bool(stdout)` in the second branch instead of checking conditions.
- This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
