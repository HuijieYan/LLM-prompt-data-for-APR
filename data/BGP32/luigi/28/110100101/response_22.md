## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is checking if a given table exists in a Hive database by running Hive commands.
2. It has a conditional statement to handle the case when a partition is specified, which triggers a different Hive command.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output from the Hive commands and decides whether the table exists or not.
4. The function does not correctly parse the output of the Hive commands to determine existence.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect parsing of the `stdout` variable after running Hive commands. The function does not accurately check whether the table exists based on the output it receives.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic that checks for table existence based on the output received from the Hive commands. By correctly parsing the `stdout` variable, we can make sure that the function accurately determines if the table exists or not.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function includes updated string formatting and proper parsing of the `stdout` variable to accurately determine whether the table exists or not. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
