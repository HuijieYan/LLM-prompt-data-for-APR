### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output.

The bug is related to how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first `if` block, the function checks if the table name is directly in the `stdout` string, which can lead to incorrect results. In the second case, when checking for table existence with partitions, the function does not handle the output correctly and always returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic in the first `if` block to properly check if the table name is in the list of tables returned from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Modify the logic in the `else` block to properly check if the partition exists in the provided table.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')[1:]  # Skip the "OK" first line
        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version:
1. In the first `if` block, all tables are listed using `show tables`, and then the behavior checks if the `table` exists in the list of tables.
2. In the `else` block, the `stdout` is checked to see if it is not an empty string, indicating the existence of partitions.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the expected test cases.
