### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of a table. In the first part of the function (where partition is None), it checks if the table name is present in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. However, the check `table in stdout` would match any occurrence of the table name within the output, leading to false positives. 

In the second part (where partition is not None), it performs a similar check but for the partitioned table. However, the `run_hive_cmd` output is not parsed correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `table_exists` function to properly parse the output of `run_hive_cmd` and check for the table existence or partition existence. We should also consider the case insensitivity requirement specified in the test cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1};""".format(database, table))
    
        if stdout:
            return partition == self.partition_spec(partition)
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the function as described above, we correctly check for table existence (case-insensitive) and partition existence based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases provided.
