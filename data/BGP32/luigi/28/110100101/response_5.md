### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database.
- The issue lies in the logic used to verify if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug is in the logic where the function checks if the `table in stdout` to determine if the table exists.
- The function is not properly handling the case where the table name appears as part of another word in the `stdout`.
- The function also does not correctly handle the case when partition is not `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Instead of a simple string check for `table in stdout`, it is better to split the lines and check for an exact match.
- When partition is not `None`, the function should retrieve all partitions and check if the specified partition exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return 'OK' in partitions  # Assuming 'OK' is the expected format when partition exists
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newlines and checking for an exact match, we ensure that the function accurately determines if the table/partition exists.
