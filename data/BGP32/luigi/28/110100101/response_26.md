Based on the provided buggy function, it seems there are several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` method is not defined within the `HiveCommandClient` class or the code snippet provided, which can cause the function to fail.
2. The condition check in the `table_exists` function may not correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table exists.

To fix these issues, we should define the `run_hive_cmd` method or import it properly. Additionally, we should adjust the condition check to correctly determine if the table exists based on the output from `run_hive_cmd` in both cases when `partition` is provided and when it is not.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return True if stdout else False
```

Make sure to define the `run_hive_cmd` method properly for this corrected function to work as expected. With these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
