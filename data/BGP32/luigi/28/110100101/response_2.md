### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks if the table exists based on the output.

The bug seems to be related to how the stdout is being checked for table existence. It does not handle cases where the table name might be part of a larger string. The logic for parsing the stdout and checking for the table name needs to be corrected.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function incorrectly checks if the table name exists in the full output returned from the Hive command. This leads to incorrect results, especially when the table name is part of a larger string.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function determines if the table exists in the output from the Hive command. We can split the stdout by lines and then check if the table name appears as a standalone line in the output. This way, we ensure that we are checking for the exact table name only.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
``` 

By splitting the stdout by lines and checking if the table name appears as a standalone line, we ensure that the function correctly determines if the table exists in the output. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
