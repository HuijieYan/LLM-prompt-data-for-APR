### Potential Errors in the Buggy Function:
1. The logic inside the `if` block for `partition is None` seems incorrect.
2. The way the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness might not be appropriate.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the `table_exists` function, the `if` condition for `partition is None` is attempting to check if the table exists by using `show tables`. However, the logic is incorrect as `run_hive_cmd` will always return `"OK"`, so it will never match the table name, leading to a false negative.
2. The function is checking for the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable directly, which might not be accurate in all cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rework the logic to correctly check for table existence for both cases (with and without partitions).
2. Validate the output of `run_hive_cmd` based on patterns returned by the Hive calls.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return "OK" in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return any(table in part for part in stdout.split("\n"))
```

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the logic for checking table existence.
2. Modified the return statement to check for the presence of the table in the partitions list.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output values.
