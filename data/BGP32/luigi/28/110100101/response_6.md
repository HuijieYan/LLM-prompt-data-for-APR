### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has issues in handling the conditionals for checking if a table exists in the database using Hive commands. It fails to properly evaluate the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The issue arises from incorrect conditional checks and how the output is processed.

### Error Locations:
1. The first conditional check returns the condition `stdout and table in stdout`, which does not properly handle the case where `table in stdout` is False.
2. The second conditional check does not correctly handle the case when `stdout` is not empty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional checks in the `table_exists` function are insufficient to determine whether a table exists based on the stdout output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional checks in the function to properly handle the cases where the table exists or not in the stdout output.
2. Ensure that the function returns `True` when the table exists and `False` when it does not.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout

        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables like '{1}'".format(database, table))

        return table in stdout
```

By modifying the conditional checks and the handling of the stdout output, the corrected function now correctly determines whether a table exists in the database based on the provided input. This version should pass the failing test cases outlined above.
