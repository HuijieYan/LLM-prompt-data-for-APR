### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function & Class Relationship**:
   - The function `table_exists` is a method of the `HiveCommandClient` class.
   - It uses an external function `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - Incorrect comparison of table names without considering case sensitivity.
   - Inconsistent handling of table names between input and output.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The buggy function compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity.
   - When the table name in the Hive output is in a different case, the comparison fails leading to incorrect results.
   - The issue reported on GitHub suggests making the comparison case insensitive.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
   - Update the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison to resolve the issue.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function now performs a case-insensitive check and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
