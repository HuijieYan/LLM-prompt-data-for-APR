### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not performing a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the Hive command.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity correctly, causing the assertions to fail.
3. The expected behavior is to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the Hive command to determine if the table exists.
4. To fix the bug, the function should ensure that both the table name and the output from the Hive command are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected code snippet above fixes the bug by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case-insensitive matching. This modification aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue (#896) related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

By implementing this correction, the function will now correctly determine if a table exists in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing tests and the reported case sensitivity issue.
