### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence in Hive.
2. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.
3. The error message indicates that the test is failing because of case sensitivity in table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive while checking table existence in Hive.

### Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the comparison in the return statements to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue related to table existence checks in Hive.
