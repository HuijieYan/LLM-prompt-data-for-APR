### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The error message states that the test case for table existence fails when the table name's case is not consistent.
2. The issue arises from the comparison of table names, where the case sensitivity causes the tests to fail.
3. The cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the retrieved table names from Hive is case-sensitive. This results in false negatives when the cases don't match, causing the tests to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive to accurately determine if a table exists.
5. We will modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the retrieved table names.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the `table.lower()` and applying it to both the `table` and the list of found tables after splitting stdout, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison for determining the existence of the table. This corrected version addresses the issue reported and should now pass the failing tests related to case sensitivity in table names.
