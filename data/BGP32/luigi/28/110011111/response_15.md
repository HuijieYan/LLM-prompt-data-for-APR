The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class stems from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, which is case insensitive, causing the test to fail when the case doesn't match.

To address this bug, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of both the table name and the output from Hive, the function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing tests.

This update resolves the issue described in the GitHub thread and addresses the functionality required for the `table_exists` method.
