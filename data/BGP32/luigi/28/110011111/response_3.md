### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The issue in the failing test is due to the function not handling table names with different cases properly. To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make it case-insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout returned by the Hive command.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition {self.partition_spec(partition)}")

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we make sure that both the table name and the output from the Hive command are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This change will fix the bug where the test fails due to case differences in table names and ensure the function works as expected.
