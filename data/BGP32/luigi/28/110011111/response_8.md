### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests because it is not handling case sensitivity when checking the existence of tables in Hive.
2. The bug arises from the comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive which are case-insensitive.
3. The issue is reflected in the failing tests where the expected table name cases do not match the actual table names returned by Hive, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case-insensitive comparison between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive.

### Bug Fix:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check by converting both the table name and the returned names to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name `table` and the names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issues.
