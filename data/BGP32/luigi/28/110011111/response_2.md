### Buggy Function Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing due to a case sensitivity issue. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given Hive database by utilizing the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. However, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case sensitive, causing the test cases to fail when the case of the table name differs from the one returned by Hive. 

The failing test cases are checking for the existence of tables, where the expected table names are in different cases than what is returned by Hive. This discrepancy leads to failed assertions because the function does a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive needs to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the table exists in a case insensitive manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Changes Made:
- Changed the comparison `table in stdout` to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` in the case where `partition` is `None`.
- This modification ensures that both the table name and the table names returned by Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior, effectively addressing the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issues.
