### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in stdout with the input table name. To fix this issue, we need to convert both the table names to lowercase before comparison. This change will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table names in the comparison to lowercase, the corrected function ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive as required. This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub and should now pass the failing tests.
