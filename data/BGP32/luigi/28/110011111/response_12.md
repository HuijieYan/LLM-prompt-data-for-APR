Given the information provided, it is clear that the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this fix, the function should now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, addressing the failing tests and satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
