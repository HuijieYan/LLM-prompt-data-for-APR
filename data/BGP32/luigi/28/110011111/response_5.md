### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is meant to check if a table exists in the Hive database, but it fails due to case sensitivity issues in comparing table names.
2. The issue stems from comparing the table name directly to the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
3. The failing tests show that the function fails when comparing table names due to case differences between the input and the retrieved table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive.
5. The provided GitHub issue #896 addresses this bug and suggests making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison between the table name and the retrieved table name in the `stdout` to be case insensitive.
2. Convert both names to lowercase or uppercase before comparison to ensure consistency.
3. Update the logic to return `True` if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive with `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the corrected function will now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue resolution.
