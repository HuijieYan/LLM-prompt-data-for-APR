### Buggy Function Analysis
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check whether a specified table exists in the provided database with an optional partition.
- The bug arises from case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the table names retrieved from the stdout of the `hive` command.
- The failing tests indicate that the function does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
- The expected behavior is that the function should perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence.
- The GitHub issues (#896 and the related case-insensitivity issue) highlight the need to fix this bug.

### Bug Cause
- The bug in the `table_exists` function is comparing the table names without considering case sensitivity.
- When the function checks for table existence, it does a direct string comparison which can fail due to case mismatch.
- The runtime values in the failing tests show that the comparisons between table names are case-sensitive resulting in failures.

### Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, update the function to perform case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence.
- Convert both the table name and the names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
- Update the `return` statement to reflect the correct logic for determining table existence based on case-insensitive comparisons.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation
- The corrected function ensures that both the table names from the function parameters and the output of `stdout` are compared after converting them to lowercase.
- By performing case-insensitive comparisons, the function now accurately checks for table existence without being affected by case differences.
- The corrected function aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
