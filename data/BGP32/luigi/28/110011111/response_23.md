### Fixing the Bug:

#### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name from the input with the table names in the `stdout`. The `table_exists` function should consider case insensitivity to handle different naming conventions effectively.

#### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison of the table names from the input and the `stdout` to be case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.

#### Updated Corrected Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence. This change addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and aligns with the expected behavior.
