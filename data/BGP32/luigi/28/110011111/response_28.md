## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues. The function is comparing the table name without considering the case, leading to test failures when comparing uppercase and lowercase table names.

The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks if the table exists based on the output. However, it does not handle the case sensitivity of table names correctly, causing discrepancies between the expected and actual results.

## Bug Identification:
The root cause of the bug is the inconsistency in case sensitivity when comparing the table names in the function. The function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive commands without converting them to a consistent case, leading to test failures for uppercase table names.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure case-insensitive matching and prevent test failures due to case variations.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, the table names (`table` and the output `stdout`) are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This modification ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

After implementing the above correction, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity correctly and pass the failing tests.
