Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue stems from the comparison of the table name received from the stdout in a case-sensitive manner. To resolve this issue and make the function case-insensitive, the comparison between the table name and the stdout should be done in a case-insensitive manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the function will compare the table name and stdout in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring that the test cases pass as expected.
