### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not account for case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The issue arises when the function compares the table name with the output from the Hive command, resulting in mismatches due to case differences.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling the case insensitivity correctly, causing assertions to fail when comparing the expected output against the actual output. The `table_exists` function should perform a case-insensitive comparison to ensure accurate results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command.

We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
- We convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison in the `table_exists` function.
- By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive.
- The function returns `False` if `stdout` is empty or `None` to maintain correct behavior.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue raised in the GitHub bug reports.
