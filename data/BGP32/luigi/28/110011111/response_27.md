### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue with case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.
- The logic in the buggy function compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this comparison can lead to mismatches in cases where the table name casing differs.
- The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly, leading to false test outcomes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` needs to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase), we can ensure the comparison is accurate regardless of the casing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With the corrected version of the function, the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive will be done in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue related to table existence checks.
