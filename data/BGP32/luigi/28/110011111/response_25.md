### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from the Hive query without considering case differences. This causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive query to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of tables regardless of the case used in their names.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures that case differences do not affect the result. This modification aligns with the fix suggested in GitHub issue #896.
