### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name extracted from `stdout` with the provided table name. The function checks if the table name is an exact match, which causes failures when the case of the table names differs.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the comparison `table in stdout` where `table` is not normalized to lowercase before comparison, leading to case sensitivity issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, normalize both the `table` name and the extracted table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By normalizing the table names to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases.
