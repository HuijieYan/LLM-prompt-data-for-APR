Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity problem when comparing the tables. The function checks whether the table exists in the `stdout` output but does not account for case differences, leading to test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Required import statement
import re

# The updated version of the buggy class with the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(re.search(r"(?i)%s" % table, stdout))
```

In the corrected function:
1. Both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison.
2. In the case where partitions are involved, the comparison is done using a case-insensitive regular expression search to ensure table existence detection.

With these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence in Hive.
