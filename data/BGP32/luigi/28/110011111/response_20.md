### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function is directly comparing the table name with the output from Hive, leading to inconsistent results due to case sensitivity.
2. The failing test cases are asserting the existence of tables with different cases ("mytable" and "MyTable"), which are not being handled correctly by the current implementation.
3. The error message shows that the assertion is failing because the function is returning `False` when it should return `True` for tables that actually exist but have different cases. This inconsistency is due to the direct string comparison without considering case differences.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before checking for existence.
5. The corrected function should compare the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from Hive to ensure a case-insensitive match.

### Corrected Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the `stdout` from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now handles the case sensitivity issue and should pass the failing test cases.
