The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function currently compares the table name directly with the output from Hive, leading to discrepancies due to case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the check is case-insensitive and consistent with Hive's behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly handle case-insensitive table existence checks. This fix aligns with the issue raised on GitHub and resolves the failing test cases.
