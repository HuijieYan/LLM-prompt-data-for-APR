### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing because it is not handling case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name from `stdout` with the input `table`. The failing test cases are checking for table existence with different cases (`mytable`, `MyTable`, `mytable`, `MyTable`) and the function fails when the case does not match exactly due to the comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing the `table` variable directly with the table names obtained from the `stdout` without considering the case sensitivity.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the function case insensitive when checking for table existence, we need to modify the comparison logic to convert both the `table` and the names from `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and the table names from `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the function now properly handles case sensitivity issues and should pass the failing test cases.
