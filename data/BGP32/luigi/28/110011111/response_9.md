The bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class is caused by a case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function compares the table name without considering case, leading to test failures when the case differs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing, making the table existence check case insensitive. This aligns with the suggested resolution mentioned in the GitHub issue to fix the case sensitivity problem.
