## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the output. The existing implementation only checks if the table name is present in the output without considering the format or position. This leads to incorrect results, as seen in the failing tests, where a table might be present in the output but not as expected.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that the table name is correctly matched against the expected format in the output. We can achieve this by splitting the stdout by newlines and then checking each line to find a match for the table name.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')

        return any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')

        return any(p.strip().lower() == self.partition_spec(partition).lower() for p in partitions)
```

By splitting the output by newlines and then checking each line for a match with the table name (case-insensitive), we ensure that the correct table existence is verified. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
