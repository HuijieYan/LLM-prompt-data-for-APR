### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the condition checking logic. In the first part of the function, when `partition` is None, the function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might be inaccurate since the `stdout` could potentially be any string containing the table name, resulting in false positives. 

In the second part of the function, when `partition` is not None, the function checks if the output is truthy to determine if the table exists. This check may not be robust since the `run_hive_cmd` function might return unexpected values, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies if the table exists by parsing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function in a more robust manner. We should modify the conditional checks to handle different cases properly and provide accurate results.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return len(partitions) > 1  # assuming partitions always start with header and have at least one partition
```

By splitting the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function into lines and then checking for the presence of the table name in the list of tables or partitions, we create more reliable checks to determine if the table exists. This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected outputs.
