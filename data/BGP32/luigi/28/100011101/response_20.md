### Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided function is due to the logic in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command and then checking the output against the table name. However, the bug arises from a misunderstanding of the expected output format of the Hive command. The function assumes that the output will only contain the table name if it exists, but in reality, there might be additional information in the output.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 1 and Case 3, the function returns `True` when it shouldn't because the output contains the word 'OK' and not just the table name.
- In Case 2 and Case 4, the function returns `False` when it should return `True` since the table name is present in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the function to correctly handle different output formats of the Hive command. One approach is to split the output on newline characters to extract only the table names and then check if the specified table is present.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the output on newline characters and then use a list comprehension to check if the specified table is present in the list of tables. This fix ensures that we correctly identify table existence regardless of additional content in the output.
