The buggy function has a logical error in the `table_exists` function. The bug is that the function is checking for the table name instead of the existence of the table itself. The bug is due to the condition checking for the presence of the table name in the stdout, which can lead to false positives when the table name is found elsewhere in the stdout string.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to explicitly check if the table exists in the stdout output.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function now correctly checks if the table exists in the stdout output and returns `True` if the table is found in the output, `False` otherwise. This should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
