### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises from the inconsistent handling of the result stored in `stdout`. In the current implementation, the function checks if `stdout` has any content, which leads to an issue when the output contains the table name followed by a newline character. The buggy function correctly checks if the table is present in the output but fails when the table name is part of a multiline string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if the table is present in the output. Instead of just checking if `stdout` is not empty, we should split the output by newline characters and look for the table name in each line of the result. This approach will account for cases where the table name is part of a multiline output.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)  # Boolean conversion is sufficient since the content structure is different for this case
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters, we ensure that each line in the output is considered independently when checking for the presence of the table. This modification allows the function to correctly handle cases where the table name is part of a multiline result.
