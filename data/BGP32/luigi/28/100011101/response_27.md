### Bug Explanation

The bug lies in the comparison condition of the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the `stdout` is truthy based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`, and if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output. However, in the provided implementation, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` might lead to incorrect results because it does not handle cases where the table name is contained within other names in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately checks if the specific table name exists in the `stdout` output. One way to achieve this is to split the `stdout` by newlines and then check if the exact table name is present in any of the lines. 

### Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version will split the `stdout` output by newlines and check if the exact table name exists in any line, ensuring accurate determination of table existence. Replace the original function with this corrected version to pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.
