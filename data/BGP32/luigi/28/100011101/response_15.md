### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling the case-sensitive comparison between the table names.
- In the failing tests, the function is returning `False` instead of `True` when the table names are case-insensitive.
- The buggy function relies on checking whether the table name exists in the stdout output from the Hive command, which leads to the discrepancy in the case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table names is case-insensitive.
- We can achieve this by converting both the table names to lowercase (or uppercase) before performing the comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table names and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and behave correctly for case-insensitive table name comparisons.
