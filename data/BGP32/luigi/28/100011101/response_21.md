### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition for checking if a table exists in Hive. In the first case, the function is checking if the table name is a substring of the `stdout` output, which causes the check to be True even if the table name is part of a larger string. This incorrect logic leads to the test failing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check for exact matches between the table name and the elements in the `stdout` output. This ensures that only tables with names exactly matching the input are considered.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected code snippet splits the `stdout` by lines in case of multiple tables being returned and checks for an exact match between the table name and each line. This modification ensures that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected.
