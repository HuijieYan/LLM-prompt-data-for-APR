### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison of the `stdout` variable to determine whether a table exists. The `run_hive_cmd` function might return additional information along with the table name, which is not being handled correctly in the comparison. This leads to false negatives in determining table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to properly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We can refine the comparison to ensure that the table name is an exact match in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by lines and then checks if the table name is present in any of those lines. This improvement ensures a more reliable detection of table existence based on the complete information returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
