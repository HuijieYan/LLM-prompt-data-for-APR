## Bug Fix

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the conditional check `return stdout and table in stdout` in the `table_exists` function. The issue arises because the `table in stdout` check is evaluating to `False` when the table name is found in the stdout output. This is leading to the incorrect return value and causing the tests to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that it correctly evaluates the presence of the table name in the stdout output. One way to do this is by splitting the stdout into lines and checking if the table name is present in any of those lines.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        if stdout:
            return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### The corrected version of the function addresses the issue with the conditional check and should now correctly determine if the table exists based on the stdout output.
