Based on the information provided, the bug seems to be related to how the function checks for the table existence based on the `stdout` output from running Hive commands.

The bug seems to be occurring because the function is checking whether the table name is in the `stdout` string directly. This leads to incorrect comparison results due to potential whitespaces or formatting differences in the `stdout` string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the checking logic to ensure robustness against different formats of the `stdout` string. One way to do this is to split the `stdout` string by newlines and then check if the table name exists in the list of strings after splitting.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.split('\n')

        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partition_list = stdout.split('\n')

        return table in partition_list
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by newlines and then checks if the table name exists in the resulting list. This approach should handle variations in the `stdout` format more effectively. It also aligns with the expected behavior and should pass the failing tests.
