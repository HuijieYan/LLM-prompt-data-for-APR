### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database by running Hive commands.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity in table names when comparing with the output from Hive commands.
3. The bug arises because the function directly compares the table name with the output without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Correction:
1. The bug fix involves converting the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing in the `table_exists` function.
2. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
3. By making the comparison case insensitive, the function now accurately determines the existence of a table in the Hive database.
