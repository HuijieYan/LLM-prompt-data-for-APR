### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks whether a table exists in a given database using Hive commands.
2. The bug arises when the function checks for table existence without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table is capitalized differently in the database.
3. The bug is highlighted in the GitHub issue, where it suggests making the table existence check case insensitive by converting the table name to lowercase before comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive commands are compared in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle case sensitivity issues by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- Both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output from Hive commands are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive.
- This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly regardless of the case of the table name in the database.
