### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has an issue with case sensitivity when comparing the table name extracted from the `stdout` with the provided table name.
2. The function checks if the table exists in the database based on the provided table name, but it does not handle case insensitivity properly.
3. The GitHub issue points out that there are cases where table names are defined with different capitalization, which causes failures in the function because Hive returns table names in lowercase.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the extracted table name from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
5. The correction should address the GitHub issue's suggested solution to compare `table.lower()` with `stdout.lower()` to handle case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the provided table name (`table`) and the extracted table name from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence. This correction aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue and should resolve the case sensitivity bug in the `table_exists` function.
