### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug arises because the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-sensitive.

The GitHub issue highlights that in some cases, table names can be defined with different cases (capitalized or lower case) but Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lower case. This discrepancy results in test failures when comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the comparison section of the `table_exists` function where `table in stdout` is used. This direct comparison does not account for case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the table name is lowercase in the output, while it is provided with mixed case or lowercase, leading to incorrect comparison results.
2. In Case 2 and Case 4, the table name and output are in different cases, causing the comparison to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` should be used instead of `table in stdout`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case-insensitive and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
