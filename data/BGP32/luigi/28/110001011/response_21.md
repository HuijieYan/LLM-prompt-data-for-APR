Based on the runtime values and types provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises due to a case sensitivity mismatch between the `table` parameter and the tables retrieved from the Hive command output stored in `stdout`. Since Hive is case insensitive, comparing the table names in a case sensitive manner leads to false negatives.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both the `table` parameter and the tables retrieved from the Hive command output are compared in a case insensitive manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """    

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert both the `table` parameter and the table names retrieved from the Hive command output to lowercase before comparison.
2. For the case when partition is not None, we return `bool(stdout)` directly as it is a more concise approach.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function will now be case insensitive, fixing the issue reported on GitHub about tables being capitalized and thus causing the tests to fail due to case mismatches.
