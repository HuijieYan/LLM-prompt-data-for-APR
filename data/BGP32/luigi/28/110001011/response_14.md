### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a database.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name from the function's input with the table names retrieved from the `stdout` after running hive commands. The comparison is case-sensitive, leading to test failures as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. The issue stems from the inconsistent case of table names causing the comparison to fail. The function does not handle the case-insensitivity of table names in the comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the input table name and the table names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
5. The fixed version of the function will include the conversion of both values to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the fixed version:
- Both the `table` name from the input and the table names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`.
- This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
