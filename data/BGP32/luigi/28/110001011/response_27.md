### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database by running a Hive command. The function compares the table name with the output from the Hive command to determine existence.
2. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the function does a direct string match between the table name and the output, leading to test failures when the case does not match due to Hive being case insensitive.
3. The bug is clearly identified in the GitHub issue, where it suggests checking `stdout` against `table.lower()` to avoid the case sensitivity problem.
4. To fix the bug, the `table` parameter should be converted to lowercase before comparing it with the `stdout` output from the Hive command.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
