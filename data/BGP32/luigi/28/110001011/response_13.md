### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case sensitivity correctly. It compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences.
2. The bug is identified in the comparison of the table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug causes failures in cases where the table name provided has a different case than the table name returned by Hive, resulting in false negatives for table existence checks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, the function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
