### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database. The function queries Hive using `run_hive_cmd` and checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue, where the function does not handle the case of the table name properly. The function should compare the table name case-insensitively with the output from Hive to accurately determine table existence.

### Error Locations
- The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case differences.
- In Case 2 and Case 4, where the table name and the output from Hive exhibit case differences, the function fails to recognize the table's existence due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly without considering case differences. Since Hive is case insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, the direct comparison in the function fails to account for these differences. This results in incorrect determinations of table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the comparison in the function to be case insensitive. Convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before the comparison to ensure a consistent and accurate check for table existence.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- Both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison using `lower()`.
- The `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` condition ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence.
- The `bool(stdout)` is used directly since the function only needs to check the existence of output without caring about the specific content.
