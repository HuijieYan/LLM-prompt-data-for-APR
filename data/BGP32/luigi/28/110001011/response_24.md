### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a specified table exists in a given database. It uses `hive` invocations to find the information.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function compares the table name without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug causes the function to return incorrect results when the table names are in different cases, leading to failing tests as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive when checking if the table exists in the stdout.
5. The corrected version of the function will compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the stdout to handle case sensitivity.

### Updated Function:
```python
# The corrected/updated version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By comparing the lowercase versions of both the table name and the stdout, this corrected version ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the database. This modification addresses the reported issue regarding case sensitivity in table existence checks.
