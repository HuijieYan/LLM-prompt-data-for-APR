### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a specified database by running a Hive command.
3. The bug arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from Hive, leading to test failures due to case mismatches.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version ensures a case-insensitive check for the table existence in the database, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
