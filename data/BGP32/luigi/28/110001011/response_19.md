### Analyze the buggy function
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses `hive` invocations to determine if a table exists in a given database. The issue with the current implementation is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly, leading to test failures when checking for tables with different capitalizations.

### Identified bug
The root cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and the table names in the output (stdout) is case-sensitive, causing incorrect results when the cases do not match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, it is necessary to convert both the table name and the table names in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                 (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the entries in the `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison to make the check case insensitive. This change aligns with the resolution proposed in the GitHub issue describing the bug and the suggested fix.
