### Analysis:
1. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the `table_exists` function should be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of tables in Hive.
2. The function currently does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the output from the Hive command, which leads to case sensitivity issues.
3. The function does not handle case sensitivity properly, causing test failures when comparing table names with different cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table names. If the table names have different cases than what is returned by Hive, the function fails to detect the table's existence.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner. This involves converting both strings to lowercase or uppercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and addresses the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
