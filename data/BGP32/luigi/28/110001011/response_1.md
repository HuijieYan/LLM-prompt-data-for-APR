### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for table existence without considering case sensitivity.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need for the function to be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the output from the command.
3. The function fails to account for case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to convert both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before comparing them.
5. The corrected version of the function will ensure case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using `lower()` before comparing for table existence. This change ensures case insensitivity, addressing the reported bug in the GitHub issue.
