### Potential Error Locations
1. In the comparison of the table name with the tables retrieved from the `stdout`.
2. Incorrect handling of case sensitivity in table name comparison.
3. Possible inconsistency in table name formats causing failures.

### Bug Cause
The bug originates from the comparison of the input table name with the tables retrieved from the `stdout`. Since Hive is case-insensitive, it returns table names in lowercase. The function does a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures when the table names have different cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables obtained from `stdout` is case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version of the function, both the input table name and the tables retrieved from `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and resolves the issue outlined in the GitHub bug reports.
