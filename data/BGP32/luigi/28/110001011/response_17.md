### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. However, the bug causes it to be case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the table names don't match exactly.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison of the table name with the output from Hive, which may not match due to case differences.
3. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results when the table names have different cases. The function should perform a case-insensitive check to accurately determine if the table exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output to be case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison between the table name and the output to be case-insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to ensure that it returns `True` only if the table name exists in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will now perform a case-insensitive check to determine the existence of the table accurately.
