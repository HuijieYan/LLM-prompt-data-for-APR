### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of the `table` variable with the `stdout` output may be case-sensitive, leading to test failures.
2. In the case where `partition is not None`, the output comparison might not be correctly handling the case sensitivity.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the `table_exists` function not accounting for case differences between the table name provided and the actual table names returned by Hive. The comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive, leading to failures when the cases do not match.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, convert both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
