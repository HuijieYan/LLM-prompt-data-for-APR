### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database using hive commands.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
3. The bug arises from the mismatch in case sensitivity between the table name provided and the table name returned in stdout from the hive command.
4. The current implementation does a direct comparison of the table name and the stdout, which can lead to case sensitivity issues.
5. To fix the bug, the function should compare the lowercase versions of both the table name and the stdout to ensure case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
2. This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function ensures case insensitivity, fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
