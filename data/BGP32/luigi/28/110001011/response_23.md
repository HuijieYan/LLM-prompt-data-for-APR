### Analysis
The bug is related to the case sensitivity of table names when checking for table existence in Hive. The `table_exists` function does not handle case sensitivity properly, which leads to incorrect results when comparing table names with the output from Hive. The GitHub issue highlights this problem and suggests a solution to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison of the table name directly with the stdout without considering case sensitivity. This results in the function returning incorrect results when the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive when checking if the table exists in Hive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now correctly handle case sensitivity issues and return the expected results for the table existence check.
