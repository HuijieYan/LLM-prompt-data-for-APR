### Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database using Hive commands.
- The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The bug report in the GitHub issue suggests making the comparison case insensitive.

### Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case sensitive.
2. The comparison `table in stdout` with `table` not being converted to lowercase.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises because the comparison in the original function `table_exists` is case sensitive, while Hive is case insensitive. This leads to test failures when the table names are in different cases.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Changes Made:
- Converted both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison using `lower()` method.
- Made the comparison logic case insensitive.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now correctly determine if a table exists in a Hive database regardless of the case of the table name.
