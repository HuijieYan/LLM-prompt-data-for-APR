### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check whether a table exists in the specified database. However, it has a bug where it is not handling case sensitivity correctly.
2. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive's `show tables` command without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures when table names are in different cases.
3. The GitHub issue highlighted the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to handle scenarios where table names are capitalized or in different cases than expected. The suggested fix is to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase output from Hive.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check and preventing failures due to case differences.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` parameter and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and improves the reliability of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class.
