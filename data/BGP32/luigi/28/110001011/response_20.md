### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a specified Hive database by running a Hive command and parsing the output.
2. The bug occurs when the table names are compared without considering case sensitivity, leading to incorrect results.
3. The bug is identified in the code snippet where the table name and the stdout from the Hive command are compared directly without considering case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
5. The suggested fix is to modify the comparison to use lowercase versions of the table name and the stdout.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the `table_exists` function now correctly handles case sensitivity issues when checking for the existence of a table in the database.
