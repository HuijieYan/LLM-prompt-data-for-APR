### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is meant to check if a table exists in a Hive database by running Hive commands. The bug reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case insensitive when comparing table names retrieved from Hive.
2. The bug arises from a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive database, leading to test failures when table names are not in the exact case.
3. In the provided buggy function, the comparison of the table name with the tables listed in `stdout` is case sensitive, causing mismatches.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` condition is used to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
- The function now returns `True` if the table exists (case-insensitive match found), else it returns `False`.
- The issue reported on GitHub for making the `table_exists` function case insensitive should now be resolved by this corrected version.
