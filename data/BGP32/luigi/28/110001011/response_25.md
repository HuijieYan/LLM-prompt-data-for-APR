### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command.
2. The bug is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists.
3. The bug arises because the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case sensitive, leading to false negatives if the cases do not match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, fixing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
