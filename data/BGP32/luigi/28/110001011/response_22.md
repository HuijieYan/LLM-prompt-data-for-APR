### 1. Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class and is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and check the output. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be made case-insensitive when comparing table names in the output.

### 2. Error Location:
The error lies in the comparison of the table name with the output of the Hive command. The function is currently performing a direct comparison, which is case-sensitive.

### 3. Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the output without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the table names have different cases in the Hive database compared to what is provided as input.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` variables are converted to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method. This adjustment ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, as requested in the GitHub issue.
