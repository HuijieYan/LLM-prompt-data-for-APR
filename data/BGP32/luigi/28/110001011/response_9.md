### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case-insensitive when checking for the existence of a table due to Hive being case-insensitive.
3. The current implementation of the function compares the table name directly with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, which can lead to case sensitivity issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case-insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison in the function to convert both the table name and the command output to lowercase before performing the check. This way, the comparison will be case-insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase before the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence in the Hive database.
