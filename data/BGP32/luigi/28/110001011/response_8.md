### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a specific database using Hive queries.
2. The bug arises from case sensitivity in comparing the table names between the provided table name and the table names retrieved from the Hive queries.
3. The buggy function does a direct string comparison between the table names without considering case sensitivity. This results in failures when the table names have different cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the provided table name and the retrieved table names to a consistent case before comparison.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both `table` and the names in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the provided `table` and the table names in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence in the database.
