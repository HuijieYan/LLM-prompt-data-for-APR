### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking if a table exists in a database, especially with partitions. The function is returning `True` only if the `stdout` is not empty, which may not be the correct condition for determining if the table exists.

### Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the condition checking the `stdout` variable:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
This condition returns `True` if `stdout` is not empty, which may not always indicate that the table exists in the database. 

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the specific table name is present in the `stdout` rather than just checking if `stdout` is not empty.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split() if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` before checking the presence of the table name, we can ensure that the correct check is being performed.
