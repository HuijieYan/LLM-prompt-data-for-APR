The bug in the `table_exists` function is in the logic for checking whether the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd`. The function currently checks if the table name is directly in the output string, which can lead to incorrect matching, especially when the table name contains substrings of other table names. Instead, it should split the output into lines and check for exact matches.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to split the stdout into lines and check if the table name exists in any of the lines. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the function will properly split the stdout into lines and check for an exact match with the table name. This correction should make the function pass the failing test cases provided.
