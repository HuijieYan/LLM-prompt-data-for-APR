### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. The function currently checks if the table name is in the entire `stdout`, which can lead to false positives or negatives if the table name is part of another string in the `stdout`. This is evident from the failing test cases where the function incorrectly returns `True` or `False` when it should be the opposite.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is not properly parsing the `stdout` to check for the exact table name, leading to incorrect evaluations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the function checks if the exact table name is in the `stdout`. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` by lines and then checking if the table name is present in the resulting list of lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` by lines before checking for the presence of the table name, we ensure that we are accurately evaluating the existence of the table. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
