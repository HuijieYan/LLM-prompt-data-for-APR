### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and optionally in a specified partition. The bug seems to be in the way the function checks the existence of the table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Issues:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, the function only checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout`, which will cause an issue when the `stdout` contains multiple table names concatenated with newline characters (as seen in Case 2 and Case 4). This leads to a false positive result and the test case failing.
2. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not sufficient to accurately check table existence.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Parse the `stdout` to extract the individual table names and then check if the `table` name is in the extracted list.
2. Update the logic to handle the multiple table names in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_list = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in table_list
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, the `stdout` is split by newline characters to get a list of individual table names in the `table_list`.
2. The function now checks if the `table` is in the `table_list`, ensuring an accurate check for table existence.
3. The code has been simplified to return `bool(stdout)` directly in the else block to handle the case where `stdout` is not empty. 

### By applying these fixes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
