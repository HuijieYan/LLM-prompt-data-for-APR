### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking for the existence of the table. In the current implementation, the function checks if the table name is present in the entire stdout output when querying for tables or partitions. This leads to false positives when a table name is a substring of another table name in the output.

### Bug Location:
The issue arises in the `table_exists` function where the check for `table in stdout` is used to determine table existence.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function checks for table existence. Instead of directly checking if the table name is present in the entire `stdout` output, we should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the lines of the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and checking for the table name on each line, we ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of the table. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
