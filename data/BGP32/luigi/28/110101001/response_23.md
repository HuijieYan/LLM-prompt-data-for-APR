The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it doesn't correctly check if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is returning `True` or `False` based on whether the `stdout` is not empty, but it should instead check if the table name is present in the `stdout`. This is where the bug lies.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to correctly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` when determining if the table exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and checks if the table name is present in the output. It also simplifies the return statements to directly return the result of the condition checks.
