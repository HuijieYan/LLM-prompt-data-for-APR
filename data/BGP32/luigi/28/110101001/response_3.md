### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue with the way it checks for the existence of a table in the database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks if the table name is in the output of the command to determine if the table exists.

However, the bug lies in the comparison logic. The function only checks if the table name is present in the output string, which can lead to false positives. For example, if the table name is a substring of another table name in the output, the function would incorrectly consider the table as existing.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function checks if the table name is simply in the output string, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure that we are correctly checking for the existence of the exact table name in the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the output of the `show tables` command by newline and then check if the exact table name matches any of the tables retrieved. This ensures that we are accurately determining the existence of the table.
