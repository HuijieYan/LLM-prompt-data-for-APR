### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. In the current implementation, the function checks if the full table name is present in the `stdout` output, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that the function checks if the full table name is present in the `stdout` output, instead of comparing line by line for each table name.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` by newline characters and check if the table name exists in the list of table names obtained from `stdout` line by line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters before checking for the table existence, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
