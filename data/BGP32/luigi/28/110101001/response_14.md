## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the output of the Hive command.

## Issues:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` in the first condition might not work as expected due to trailing newlines or spacing.
2. The handling of newlines in the stdout when checking the table name.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is caused by the inconsistency in handling the stdout output of the Hive command. The comparison `table in stdout` doesn't account for possible newlines or spacing in the output, leading to incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Strip the trailing whitespace and newlines from the stdout before comparing the table name.
2. Modify the condition to check for the table name in each line of the stdout to accurately determine table existence.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout.strip() and any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By stripping the whitespace and newlines and checking each line for the table name, the corrected function should now accurately determine the existence of the table.
