### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is incorrectly checking if the table exists in the database. The bug seems to be related to how the function compares the table name in the `stdout`.

### Potential Error Location
The bug might be occurring in the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable and the input `table`.

### Cause of the Bug
In the provided buggy function, the bug occurs because the function is checking if the whole `table` is in the `stdout` string, leading to incorrect results. For example, in Case 2, the function is returning `False` even though the table name `'MyTable'` is in the stdout.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly check if the table name exists in the `stdout` variable, considering the different cases where the table name might be present. We can utilize the `split` function to split the `stdout` and then check if the table name is present in any of the parts.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_exists = any(table in t for t in stdout.split('\n'))
            return table_exists
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By utilizing `split` and `any`, the corrected version of the function can now correctly verify if the table exists in the `stdout` variable, fixing the bug. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
