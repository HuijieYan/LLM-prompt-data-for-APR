The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the condition for checking if a table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is incorrect. The function currently checks if the table name is in the entire output string, which can lead to false positives if the table name is part of another word in the output.

To fix this issue, we should split the output by newline characters and then check if the table name is in the list of lines. This way, we ensure that we are specifically checking for the existence of the table name as a separate entry in the output.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by newline characters and then checks if the `table` name is in the list of lines. The last return statement has been simplified to return the boolean evaluation of `stdout` directly.

This updated function should pass the failing test cases provided.
