### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to incorrect logic when checking for the existence of a table in the database. The function is checking for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is incorrect.

### Issues:
1. The function is checking for the presence of the exact table name in the output, without considering multiple tables in the result.
2. The function is not handling case sensitivity in table names.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails the test cases because it does not properly handle the formatting of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and does not account for case sensitivity in table names. It only checks for the exact table name in the output, which leads to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to split the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline characters to handle multiple tables in the result.
2. While checking for table existence, convert both the table name and the output table names to lowercase to handle case insensitivity properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(tbl.lower() == table.lower() for tbl in stdout.split('\n') if tbl)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle multiple tables in the output and check for table existence in a case-insensitive manner, passing the failing tests.
