### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect comparison of the `table` name in the `stdout` variable. The function expects `table` to be an exact match in the output from `run_hive_cmd`, but in some cases, the `table` name might be part of a larger string.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. We should split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if the `table` name is present in any of the lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By updating the comparison logic to check if the `table` name is present in any line in the `stdout`, we ensure that the function correctly determines if the table exists. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
