### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to how the function checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table name is present in the stdout output, but it fails to handle cases where the table name might be part of another string in the output. This leads to incorrect results in the test cases where the table name is a substring of the stdout.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to update the logic for checking the presence of the table name in the stdout. Instead of directly checking for the table name, we should split the stdout into lines and then check if the table name is present as a whole word in any of the lines.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout into lines and checking if the table name is present as a whole word in any line, we ensure a more accurate check for the table's existence. This correction should address the issues observed in the failing test cases.
