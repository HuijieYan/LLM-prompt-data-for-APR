### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. In Case 1 and Case 3, where the `table` value is `'mytable'`, the condition `table in stdout` would be True because 'mytable' is a substring of 'OK'. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`.

Similarly, in Case 2 and Case 4, the condition `table in stdout` would also be True because 'mytable' is present in the stdout string 'OK\nmytable'. This leads to the function returning `True` when it should return `False`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should check if the table's name exists as a whole word in the `stdout` string instead of just as a substring. One way to do this is by splitting the `stdout` string by newline characters and then checking if the table name is present in the resulting list.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

With this correction, the function should now properly check if the table name exists as a whole word in the `stdout` string, passing the failing test scenarios provided.
