### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a logic issue where it checks if the table exists in the stdout by simply checking if the table name is in the stdout. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the formatting of the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd`. The buggy function does not handle the case where multiple table names are returned with each table on a new line.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the flawed logic in the `table_exists` function that only checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout without considering the newline characters that may separate multiple table names.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly parse the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd`. We should split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the list of table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout.split('\n') and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout.split('\n') and True in [table in line for line in stdout.split('\n')]
``` 

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking if the table name exists in the list of table names, we ensure that the function can correctly determine if a table exists in the stdout output. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
