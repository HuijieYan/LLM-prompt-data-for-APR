### Analysis and Bug Explanation
The issue with the `table_exists` function lies in the way it checks for the existence of the table. The function expects the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to contain the table name when the table exists. However, the current implementation does not properly handle cases where the table name is part of multiple lines or has additional characters.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` values to determine table existence. The function only checks if the `table` is directly in the `stdout`, which leads to issues when the `table` is part of a multi-line response.

### Bug Cause
In Cases 2 and 4, the function fails because the `stdout` contains additional information besides just the table name. The function incorrectly returns True based on a partial match between the `table` and `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should update the function to properly parse the `stdout` response to ensure that the table name is a standalone entry in the response. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` response and checking each line individually.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.splitlines()
        return any(t.strip() == table for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.splitlines()
        return any(p.strip() == self.partition_spec(partition) for p in partitions)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` response into lines and checking each line individually, the function can now accurately determine the existence of the table regardless of the format of the response. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
