The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks if the table is in the `stdout` response. The current implementation checks for an exact match, which causes issues when the table name is included in a string with other data. The function also does not handle case insensitivity for table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the `stdout` response, regardless of its position in the string, and also make it case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(table.lower() in line.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if the table name is present in the `stdout` response and handle case insensitivity. This should make the function pass the failing tests provided.
