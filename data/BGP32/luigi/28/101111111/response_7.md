In the provided buggy function, the `table_exists` method is failing due to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function is comparing the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case differences, leading to test failures.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` method:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    # previous methods unchanged...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure that the comparison is case insensitive. This change resolves the issue reported in GitHub and allows the `table_exists` function to pass the failing tests.

This correction aligns with the solution proposed in the GitHub issue (#896) titled "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive," which suggests checking the stdout against the lowercase version of the table name to avoid case sensitivity issues.
