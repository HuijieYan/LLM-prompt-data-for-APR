To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before checking for equality. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the letters.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive. This change will resolve the failing tests and also align with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue.

After implementing this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values described in the cases provided.
