To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive, as indicated in the GitHub issue. The comparison should be performed between the lowercase version of the table name and the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making use of the `lower()` method to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, we ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive. This change aligns with the request made in the GitHub issue to address the case sensitivity problem.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output for each scenario outlined.
