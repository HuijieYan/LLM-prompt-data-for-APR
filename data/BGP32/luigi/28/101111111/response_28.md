To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function that causes the failing tests, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the output from running the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- In the corrected function, both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` output from running the Hive command are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before doing the comparison.
- This change ensures that the comparison for table existence is case-insensitive, addressing the issue described in the failing tests.
- By making the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected function will now pass the failing tests.

After applying this fix, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
