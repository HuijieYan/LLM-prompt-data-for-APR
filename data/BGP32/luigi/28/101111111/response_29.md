To fix the buggy function `table_exists` and make it case-insensitive as requested in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, the function will now handle case variations correctly and pass the failing tests. This change aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue to make `table_exists` case-insensitive.

The corrected function ensures that the comparison is made without considering the case of the strings, addressing the issue highlighted in the failing tests and the corresponding GitHub issue.
