To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparing them. This will ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing, we ensure that the function behaves correctly in a case-insensitive manner.

This correction addresses the issue raised in the GitHub thread where it was suggested to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to avoid failures when dealing with table names in different cases.

The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values as outlined in the test cases above.
