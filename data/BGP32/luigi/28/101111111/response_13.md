The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the output from Hive. The function does not take into account the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase, we ensure that the comparison is correct regardless of the case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                         (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By applying this change, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive.

This modification addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and aligns with the proposed solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

After implementing this fix, the failing tests provided earlier should pass without raising any further assertions.
