To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the tables returned by `run_hive_cmd`. This will ensure that the function works correctly even if the table names are in different cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation of the fix:
- The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the `table` and the tables returned by `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison.
- The `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` expression converts all table names in the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.
- By making this change, we address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the function works correctly regardless of the case of table names.

By using this corrected version of the function, the failing test cases should pass successfully without any `AssertionError`.
