The buggy function `table_exists` fails due to case sensitivity in comparing the table name retrieved from the Hive command with the input table name. To fix this issue and make the comparison case insensitive, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive output is case insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the test case and GitHub.
