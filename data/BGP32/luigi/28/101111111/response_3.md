The buggy function `table_exists` fails because it doesn't take into account case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The test cases are failing because the function is comparing the table names in a case-sensitive manner, leading to assertion errors.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By making this change, the function `table_exists` will now compare table names in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue #896.
