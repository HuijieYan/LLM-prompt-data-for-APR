The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. The function compares the table name directly with the tables listed in `stdout`, which can cause issues due to case differences.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison to make it case insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and will pass the failing tests as expected.
