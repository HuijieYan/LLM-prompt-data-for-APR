To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before checking if `table` is in `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This change addresses the issue described in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
