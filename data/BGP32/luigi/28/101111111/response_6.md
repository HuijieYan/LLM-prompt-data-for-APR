To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-insensitive. The current implementation is case-sensitive, leading to failures in the provided test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and the output from Hive to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them in a case-insensitive manner.
- This modification ensures that the `table_exists` function is case-insensitive, addressing the issue identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

Once you replace the buggy function with the corrected version, the provided failing test cases should pass, and the function would behave as expected, matching the specified criteria and fixing the bug reported on GitHub.
