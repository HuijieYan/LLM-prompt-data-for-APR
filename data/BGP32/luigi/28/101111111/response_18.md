To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function and address the failing test cases, we need to update the function to make it case-insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

Explanation of the fix:
- In the corrected version of the function, both the `table` variable and the `stdout` output from Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.
- This change ensures that the comparison for table existence is case-insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
- By making this small adjustment, the function now correctly handles the case sensitivity of table names in Hive, leading to passing test cases.

After making this modification, the `table_exists` function should work as expected, passing the failing tests and ensuring that table existence checks are case-insensitive in Hive.
