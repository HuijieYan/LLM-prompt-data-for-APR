To fix the bug where the `table_exists` function fails due to case sensitivity, we need to modify the comparison part of the function so that it checks if the table name in the output is equal to the lowercased version of the input table name. This change will make the comparison case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making this change, the function will check if the lowercased table name exists in the lowercased output from `run_hive_cmd`, allowing case insensitive table existence checking.

This correction will address the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, as well as resolve the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
