To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. Currently, the buggy function is comparing the table name directly to the output `stdout`, which might be in a different case causing the test cases to fail. We should modify the comparison to be case-insensitive to match with the test expectations.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, aligning with the test expectations and resolving the failing test cases provided.

The corrected function will now pass the failing test cases and match the expected input/output values mentioned in the runtime analysis. This change also aligns with the GitHub issue discussing the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
