To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking. This will ensure that the comparison works correctly regardless of the case of the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the table name and the stdout are both converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison. This change makes the comparison case-insensitive, resolving the issue reported in the failing tests.

By making this modification, the `table_exists` function will now correctly handle case sensitivity and pass the failing tests provided. Additionally, it aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue, fixing the bug as described.
