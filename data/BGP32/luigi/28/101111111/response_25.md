To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case before checking for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function will now return `True` if the table name (case-insensitive) is found in the stdout, as expected by the test cases.

Make sure to run the failing tests again to verify that the corrected function now passes all the test cases. This fix addresses the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
