Based on the failing tests and the input/output analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the output `stdout`. The function is not handling case sensitivity for table names properly, causing the tests to fail when checking for table existence.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the comparison case insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that should pass the failing tests:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This correction should address the failing test cases and resolve the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
