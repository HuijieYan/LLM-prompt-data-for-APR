To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before checking for existence. This will address the issue raised in GitHub regarding case sensitivity in table name comparisons.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This corrected version will address the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
