Based on the analysis of the buggy function, related functions, failing test, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug is due to a case sensitivity issue when checking for table existence in Hive. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class does not handle case sensitivity properly, causing the test to fail in certain scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make it case insensitive when comparing the table names in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, the `table.lower()` is used to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with `stdout.lower()`. This adjustment makes the comparison case insensitive, allowing the function to correctly check for table existence regardless of the case of the table name.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided. This solution aligns with the GitHub issue raised and addresses the case sensitivity concern in the function.
