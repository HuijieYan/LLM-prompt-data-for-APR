To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command to be case insensitive. This is necessary because Hive is case insensitive when it comes to table names. We will convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we use `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the Hive output. This modification addresses the issue described in the GitHub thread and makes the `table_exists` function case insensitive when checking for table existence in Hive.

Once this correction is applied, the function should pass all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
