To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the `table` variable and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them. This will address the issue raised in the GitHub thread about case sensitivity in table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them.
2. We return `bool(stdout)` directly as the conditional check. If `stdout` is not empty, it will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

By making this change, we ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case insensitive, resolving the failing test cases and addressing the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table names.
