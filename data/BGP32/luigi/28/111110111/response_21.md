To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The expected behavior is to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase before checking for equality.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the `table_exists` function is case insensitive. This correction will address the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values as described.

This fix also aligns with the GitHub issue raised (#896) suggesting the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive for better compatibility with Hive's case insensitivity.
