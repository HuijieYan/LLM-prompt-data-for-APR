To address the bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. Currently, the function checks if the table name exists in the `stdout` output from running a Hive command. However, since Hive is case-insensitive, we need to lowercase both the table name and the `stdout` output for a successful comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def run_hive_cmd(self, hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
        # Assume the correct implementation is here

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Assume the correct implementation is here

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By lowercasing both the `table` and `stdout` values before comparison, we can ensure a case-insensitive check.

This correction will address the failing test cases provided in the test code. Additionally, it aligns with the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

The corrected function will satisfy all the expected input/output variable values mentioned in the failing test cases.
