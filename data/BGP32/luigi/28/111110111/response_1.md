To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive. Currently, the function does a direct comparison which can lead to issues with case sensitivity.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison operation to be case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing.
2. Update the function to return `True` when the table is found in the case-insensitive `stdout`.
3. Refactor the function to enhance readability and maintainability.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version, the `table_exists` function will perform a case-insensitive comparison between the `table` name and the tables listed in the `stdout`. This change will make the function more robust and solve the issue of failing tests due to case sensitivity.

This solution addresses the problem reported in the GitHub issue #896 and aligns with the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
