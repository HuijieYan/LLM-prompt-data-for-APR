To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive case-insensitive. We should normalize both strings to lowercase before doing the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By changing the comparison to be case-insensitive using `lower()` function for both `table` and `stdout`, we can ensure that the function works correctly for tables with different casing.

This correction will address the failing test cases described earlier and also align with the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and provide the expected input/output values.
