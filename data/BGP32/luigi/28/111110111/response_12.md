## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function was due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table name with the output from Hive. To fix this bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, the corrected version compares the lowercased versions of both the table name and the output from Hive.

By using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` in the return statement, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by differences in the case of the characters.

This correction aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue #896 related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

The corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values as specified in the test cases.
