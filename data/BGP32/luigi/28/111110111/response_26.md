Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the expected table name. The function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison to address this problem.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that should pass all the provided test cases and resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the `table_exists` function to use a case-insensitive comparison by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lower case strings, we can address the issue of failing tests due to case mismatch. This fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass all the provided failing test cases and ensure that the comparison of table names is case insensitive.
