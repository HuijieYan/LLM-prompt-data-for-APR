To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to address the case sensitivity issue raised in GitHub issue #896. The problem lies in the comparison of the table name in a case-sensitive manner against the output from the Hive command, which is case-insensitive. We should ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive way to prevent test failures due to case mismatches.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, we are ensuring that table names are compared in a case-insensitive manner against the output from the Hive command.

With this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values provided for each test case. This fix also addresses the case insensitivity issue described in the GitHub issue #896.
