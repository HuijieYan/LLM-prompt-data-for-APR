The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function is currently comparing the table name directly to the stdout output without considering the case sensitivity, leading to failing test cases where tables with uppercase letters are not correctly identified.

To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case insensitive, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout output to ignore the case. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison using the `lower()` method, we ensure that the function is case insensitive and will pass the failing test cases.

After implementing this change, the `table_exists` function should now correctly identify tables regardless of their case in Hive, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub reports.
