To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to adjust the comparison logic to be case-insensitive. Currently, the function checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout` exactly as it is provided, leading to failures when there are case differences.

The suggested strategy is to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` to lowercase and then perform the comparison. This approach will make the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub pull request.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function:
- We use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` to convert both strings to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- The `bool(stdout)` call is sufficient for checking the presence of partitions in the `stdout` output.
- This approach ensures that the function behaves correctly in scenarios where the table names might differ in case.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should pass all the failing test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values.
