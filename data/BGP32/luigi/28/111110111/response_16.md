Based on the information provided, the bug in the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` class is that it is case-sensitive when checking for table existence. The expected behavior is to make it case insensitive. To fix this bug, the function should convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function should now pass the failing test cases and behave as expected. This fix addresses the issue reported in GitHub, making the `table_exists` function case insensitive for table names.
