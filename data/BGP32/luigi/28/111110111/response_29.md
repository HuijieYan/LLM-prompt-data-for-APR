### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, there is a case sensitivity issue in the comparison between the table name and the stdout returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The failing test case is due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the stdout where the table name is 'MyTable' but the stdout contains 'mytable'. This issue is also reported in GitHub issue #896, suggesting that the `table_exists` function should be case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison between the table name and the stdout without considering case sensitivity.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase or uppercase before comparison to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and the `stdout` are converted to lowercase before comparison to make the check case insensitive. This change addresses the issue reported in the failing test and aligns with the fix proposed in GitHub issue #896.
