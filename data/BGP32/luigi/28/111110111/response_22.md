The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in the Hive output. The function only checks for an exact match of the table name in the output, which causes failures when table names are in different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to be case insensitive when comparing the table name in the `stdout`. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the check is case insensitive, which resolves the issue as described in the GitHub thread.

The corrected function should now pass all the provided test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values. Make sure to test the function thoroughly to confirm that it is working correctly.
