To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking. This will prevent issues arising from differences in case sensitivity between the input table name and the output from the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before checking for the table existence.

By incorporating this change, we address the issue outlined in the failing test scenarios and GitHub reports, making the function more robust and ensuring consistent behavior when dealing with table names in Hive.
