The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to handle the case sensitivity of table names. The issue arises from comparing the table name with the contents of `stdout` without considering the case difference. As a result, the test cases fail when checking for table existence with different casing.

To resolve this bug, we need to modify the comparison step to make it case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the `stdout` content to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase, the corrected function will pass all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values. This update also aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue #896 to make `table_exists` case insensitive.
