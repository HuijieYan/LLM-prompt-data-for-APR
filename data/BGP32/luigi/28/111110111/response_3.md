The buggy function `table_exists` fails to correctly determine if a table exists due to case sensitivity issues when comparing table names with the output from Hive. The failing test cases also highlight this problem.

The bug occurs because the function does a direct comparison between the table name passed as input and the output from Hive, which may have a different case. To fix this issue, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.lower() and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures the case insensitivity required to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned. This fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and align with the proposed solution discussed in the related GitHub issue.
