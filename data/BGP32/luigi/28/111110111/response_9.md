### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the given database with an optional partition condition. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output received from the `run_hive_cmd`.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the table name with the output in a case-sensitive manner, leading to assertions failing.
3. When the output from `run_hive_cmd` and the table name comparison are case-insensitive, the test should pass.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is done in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check, thereby fixing the bug. This correction aligns with the suggestions made in the GitHub issue.
