Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing table names. The function needs to consider the case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.

### Cause of the Bug:
The `table_exists` function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This direct equality comparison can lead to test failures when the table names are not in the same case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if the table exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the function to convert both the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparing them.
2. Use the `lower()` function on both the table name and the stdout string to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
3. Update the function to return `True` if the lowercase table name is found in the lowercase stdout.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Case-insensitive comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing the suggested changes in the `table_exists` function, it should now be able to handle case sensitivity issues when checking for table existence.

This corrected version will pass the failing tests and also align with the expectations outlined for each test case.
