To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. Since Hive is case-insensitive, we should convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation:
- In the case where `partition is None`, we convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method before checking if `table` exists in `stdout`.
- In the case where a partition is given, we directly check if `stdout` is truthy to determine the existence of the table since we are not comparing table names.
- The correction makes the comparison case-insensitive, which addresses the issue raised in the GitHub thread and fixes the failing test cases.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass all the failing test cases you provided and satisfy the expected input/output values.
