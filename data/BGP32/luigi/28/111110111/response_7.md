After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is evident that the issue stems from the comparison between the table name and the output in a case-sensitive manner. The buggy function `table_exists` should perform a case-insensitive comparison to handle table names accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before the comparison inside the if condition for case-insensitive matching.
- The partition specification is retrieved in the `else` block instead of directly passing a string to the `run_hive_cmd` function.

This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values for all test cases provided and addresses the issue described in GitHub as "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive."
