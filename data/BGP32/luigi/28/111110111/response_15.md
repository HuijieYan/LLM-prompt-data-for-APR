Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug stems from the table name comparison not being case insensitive, causing the assertions to fail when comparing different cases of the table names.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name to the output from Hive commands.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive commands to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check between the two values, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function has been updated to satisfy all the expected input/output values and is designed to pass the failing test cases described.
