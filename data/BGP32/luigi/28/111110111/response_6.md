## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class within the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function is called with different arguments based on the presence of a `partition`.
3. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `hive_test.py` aims to verify the behavior of the `table_exists` function in different scenarios, including case insensitivity.
4. The error occurs because the function does a direct comparison of `table` with the output `stdout`, which leads to a case-sensitive comparison.
5. The expected behavior is to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
6. The provided GitHub issue also confirms the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

## Solution
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both `stdout` and `table` to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function logic to ensure case insensitivity is maintained.
3. Implement the changes to fix the bug and pass all the test cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
