Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided information, the cause of the bug is that the comparison between the table name and stdout is case-sensitive, leading to test failures when the table names differ in case. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the output from Hive are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison, as suggested in the GitHub issue. This modification addresses the problem of test failures due to case sensitivity in table names.
