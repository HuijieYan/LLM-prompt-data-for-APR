### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by querying Hive. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug relates to case sensitivity while checking for table existence. The function directly compares the table name from the command output to the input table name without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug is clearly described in the GitHub issue. The function should compare the table name in lowercase to avoid case sensitivity issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the command output table names to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` input parameter and the `table` names retrieved from the command output are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This modification addresses the bug described in the GitHub issue.
