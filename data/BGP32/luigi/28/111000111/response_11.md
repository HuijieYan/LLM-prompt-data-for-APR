The buggy function `table_exists` currently has a bug where it is not handling case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function needs to check if the lowercase version of the table name exists in the lowercase version of the output from Hive.

The bug is causing failures in cases where the table name's case does not match the output from Hive, resulting in false negatives when checking for the existence of tables.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the table names in the Hive output are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison. This change aligns with the suggested fix provided in the GitHub issue.
