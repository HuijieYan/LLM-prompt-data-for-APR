The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from not handling the case sensitivity of table names in Hive. The function compares the table name directly to the output from a Hive command without considering the case difference. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them using the `lower()` method.
- The comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is now case-insensitive and will correctly detect the presence of the table in Hive regardless of the case.

This fix addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and ensures that the `table_exists` function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
