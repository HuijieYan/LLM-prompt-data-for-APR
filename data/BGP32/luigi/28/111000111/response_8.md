## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a database using a Hive query.
2. The bug relates to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the query output to the expected table name.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when the table names are in different cases between the query output and the expected name.
4. The suggested fix involves converting both the query output and the expected table name to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the query output and the expected table name to lowercase before comparing.
2. Use `lower()` function to convert the strings to lowercase for comparison.

## Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name in the query output and the expected table name to lowercase, the corrected function will perform a case-insensitive comparison. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures the function behaves as expected for all test cases.
