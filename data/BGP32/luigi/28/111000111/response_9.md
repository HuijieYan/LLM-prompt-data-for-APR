The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it does a case-sensitive check on the table name returned from Hive. This causes problems when the table name in Hive is in a different case than what is provided. To fix this, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we use `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()` for case-insensitive comparison, which resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug. Now the function will correctly identify the table regardless of case differences in the names.
