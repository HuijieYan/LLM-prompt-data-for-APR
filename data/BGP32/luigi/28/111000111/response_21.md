The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity, leading to potential failures in case of table names with different casing. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparison.

### Code Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison, the `table_exists` function will now be case-insensitive and will correctly determine if a table exists in the database regardless of the casing used.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and the related GitHub issue about making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.
