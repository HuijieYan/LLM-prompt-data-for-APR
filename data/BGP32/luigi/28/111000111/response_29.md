### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database with an optional partition condition. The bug involves case sensitivity in comparing the table name with the output from Hive.
2. The bug arises when comparing the table name with the output from Hive, as Hive returns table names in lowercase regardless of the original case. This leads to incorrect results when checking for table existence, especially with mixed-case table names.
3. The bug can be resolved by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to convert both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase before checking for the table existence.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

### Updated Explanation:
The corrected function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before the comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This modification addresses the issue reported on GitHub and aligns with the expected behavior as outlined in the test cases.
