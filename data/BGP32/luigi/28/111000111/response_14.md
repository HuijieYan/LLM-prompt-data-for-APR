## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a specified database.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that the function should be case insensitive when checking for table existence due to differences in capitalization.
3. The bug stems from the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive, leading to case sensitivity issues.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the table name and the output from Hive are compared in a case-insensitive manner.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Convert both the table name and the stdout from Hive to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
3. Modify the return statements to check for the lowercase table name in the lowercase stdout.

## Updated Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By making the table name and stdout comparisons case-insensitive, the updated function should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass all the expected test cases.
