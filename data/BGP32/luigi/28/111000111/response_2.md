### Analyzing the buggy function and related context

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and obtain the output. The bug reported on GitHub suggests that the comparison for table existence should be case insensitive due to Hive returning table names in lowercase. The fix proposes checking the lowercase version of the table name against the output.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The comparison `table in stdout` does not consider case sensitivity.
2. The `run_hive_cmd` function output might not match the case of the provided table name.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly to the output of `run_hive_cmd`, which might differ in case. Since Hive returns table names in lowercase, the comparison fails for tables defined with different capitalization.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output string to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in Hive.
