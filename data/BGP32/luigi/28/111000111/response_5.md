### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specific database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries.
2. There are potential error locations in the conditional check of the `table_exists` function based on the `stdout` value.
3. The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does a direct string comparison between the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value returned from the Hive query. Since Hive is case-insensitive and returns table names in lowercase, this comparison can lead to false negatives. This issue was identified in the GitHub issue discussion.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison in the `table_exists` function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` parameter and the `stdout` value to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in the specified database. This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue discussed in the GitHub thread.
