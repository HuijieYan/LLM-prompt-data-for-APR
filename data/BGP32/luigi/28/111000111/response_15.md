### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a specific database in Hive.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute a Hive command and check the output.
3. The bug reported on GitHub highlights that the function should be case insensitive when checking if a table exists because Hive is case insensitive with table names.
4. The bug occurs due to a direct check of the table name in the stdout without case normalization.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the comparison part where the table name is checked directly against the stdout without case normalization.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the function compares the table name directly without considering case sensitivity, leading to failures when the table name case differs between the input and the Hive output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to normalize the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the stdout from Hive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Updated Buggy Function with Fix:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now ensures that both the table name being checked and the output from Hive are normalized to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

By making this adjustment, the function should now successfully identify whether a table exists in Hive, regardless of the case of the table name.
