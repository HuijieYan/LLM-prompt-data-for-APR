### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function should be case-insensitive to accommodate situations where tables may have different cases. The function currently compares the table name directly with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The comparison of table names in a case-sensitive manner.
2. The method of retrieving table existence from the `stdout`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to comparing the table name with the `stdout` directly without considering case sensitivity. If the table name is stored in lowercase in the database but provided with a different case, the comparison will fail. This issue is relevant to the GitHub reports, indicating the need for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the `stdout` to make the comparison case-insensitive. This way, regardless of the case used when checking the table existence, it will return the correct result.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the comparisons are done in lowercase, making it case-insensitive. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures the function works as expected in all scenarios presented.
