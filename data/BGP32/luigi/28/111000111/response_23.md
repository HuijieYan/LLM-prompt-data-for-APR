The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug related to case sensitivity. The function currently checks if the provided table name exists in the output of a Hive command by using a strict comparison, which leads to potential case-related failures. The issue described in the GitHub thread highlights the need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from comparing the table name directly with the output from the Hive query, leading to a case-sensitive match. This causes failures when the table names have different casing in the output. The GitHub issue suggests making the comparison case-insensitive to handle such scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, you should convert both the table name and the output string to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase or uppercase) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- Both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison in the case where `partition` is not provided.
- The `stdout` comparison is simplified to directly return a boolean value based on the existence of the output.
- The function now handles the case-insensitivity issue as suggested in the GitHub issue for a more robust comparison.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case variations in table names when checking for their existence in the Hive output.
