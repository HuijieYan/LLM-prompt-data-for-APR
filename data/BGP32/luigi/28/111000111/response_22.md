The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table names obtained from Hive commands with the table names provided as input. The current implementation directly compares the table name without considering case differences, leading to test failures when the names do not match exactly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table names. One way to achieve this is to convert both the table name from the Hive command output and the input table name to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This fix ensures that the comparison between the table names is case insensitive, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report. Now, the function will return `True` if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner and `False` if it does not.
