### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a database with optional partition information.
2. The bug lies in the comparison logic where the case sensitivity of the table name is not considered.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive due to differences between table names in code and their representations in Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison by converting both the table name and the query result to lowercase before checking for existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the query result to lowercase before checking for existence.
2. Update the `stdout` variable and the `table` parameter to lowercase during comparison.
3. This change will make the function case-insensitive when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

Now, the corrected version of the function will correctly handle the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue by converting both the table name and the query result to lowercase before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.
