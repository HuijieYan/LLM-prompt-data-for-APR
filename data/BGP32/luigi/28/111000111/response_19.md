## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to perform a case-insensitive check when verifying the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue is related to the comparison between the table name provided and the table names returned by Hive, which are case insensitive.

The buggy function performs a check based on an exact match between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive. This causes failures when there are differences in case between the provided table name and the actual table names in the database.

The critical point of error is in the comparison between `table` and `stdout`, where a case-sensitive match is attempted.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive. One approach to achieve this is by converting both the provided `table` name and the table names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparison. This way, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the strings.

Additionally, we need to handle situations where the table names contain both uppercase and lowercase characters by consistently converting all names to lowercase.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The provided `table` name is converted to lowercase before checking.
- The table names returned by Hive are split and converted to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
- The function now correctly handles case differences, resolving the issue of failing tests due to case sensitivity.
