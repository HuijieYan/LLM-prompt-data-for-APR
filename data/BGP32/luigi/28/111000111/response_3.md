## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
3. The bug arises from the fact that the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case-sensitive, causing failures when table names are in different cases.
4. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the buggy function `table_exists` to convert the `table` variable to lowercase before comparing it with the Hive output.
2. Update the issue mentioned on GitHub to indicate that the bug has been fixed by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

## Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` variable and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence in the corrected `table_exists` function. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and satisfies all the expected input/output scenarios.
