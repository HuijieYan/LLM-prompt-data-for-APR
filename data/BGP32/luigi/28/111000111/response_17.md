## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The issue occurs when the table name is provided in a different case than the actual table exists in the Hive metadata.

The bug arises from the comparison of the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This way, we ensure case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
- We convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase using the `lower()` method before performing the comparison.
- This ensures that the comparison is case insensitive, and the function will correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case used in the table name.

Now, the `table_exists` function will accurately determine the existence of a table in Hive, considering case insensitivity as required by the GitHub issue.
