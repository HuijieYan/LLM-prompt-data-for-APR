### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a database, either with or without partitions.
2. The bug occurs because the function does a case-sensitive check between the table name and the output from the Hive query, leading to failures if the case doesn't match.
3. The function needs to perform a case-insensitive check by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
4. We need to update the function to handle case insensitivity correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive query to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the return statements accordingly to reflect the case-insensitive check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table.lower()}";')
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table.lower()} PARTITION ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

The corrected version ensures that the table name and the output from the Hive query are compared in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
