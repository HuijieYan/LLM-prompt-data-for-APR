### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. It calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug reported on GitHub mentions that the function should be case insensitive when checking for existing tables.
3. The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from Hive is case sensitive, causing failures when the table names do not match in case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now handle case insensitivity for table existence checks in Hive databases.
