### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking whether a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the table names are compared without case-insensitivity, leading to incorrect results.
3. The `table_exists` function doesn't handle case sensitivity in table name comparisons, causing test failures when the case of the table name does not match the retrieved table name from Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the retrieved table name from Hive is case insensitive.
5. We need to modify the function to convert both names to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

### Explanation:
1. We modified the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` and the retrieved table names from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue reported on GitHub about table name case sensitivity.
3. The function now correctly checks for the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values.
4. The bug fix follows the suggested strategy of making table existence checks case-insensitive to avoid failures due to case differences.
