## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given Hive database with an optional partition. It utilizes the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output.
2. The bug arises from a case sensitivity issue where the table names are not matched correctly due to case differences between the provided table name and the actual table name in the database.
3. The bug is reported on GitHub where the expected behavior should be case insensitive comparison for table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name comparison is case insensitive, i.e., convert both the provided table name and the tables in the database to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function will implement the case insensitive comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the provided table name and the tables in the database are converted to lowercase before comparison, making the check case insensitive. It addresses the reported bug and satisfies the expected input/output values for all the provided test cases.
