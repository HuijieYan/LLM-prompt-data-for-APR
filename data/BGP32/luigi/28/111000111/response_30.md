### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database using a case-sensitive comparison.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive in order to handle situations where the table names are in different cases.
3. The bug occurs because the function compares the table name provided in a case-sensitive manner with the tables listed in the Hive database. This leads to failures when the cases do not match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the line where the comparison is made to convert both the table name and the tables listed in the database to lowercase for a case-insensitive check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `table_exists` function to convert the table name and tables listed in the database to lowercase before comparing them.
2. Modify the return statement to check if the lowercase table name exists in the lowercase output from the Hive command.
3. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

### Result:
The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub and aligns the function with the expected input/output values for the test cases.
