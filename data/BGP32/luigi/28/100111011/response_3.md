### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py`.
2. The failing test is `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py`.
3. The error message suggests an assertion error due to the function returning False when it should be True.
4. The runtime input/output values show the function incorrectly comparing table names without case insensitivity which causes the test to fail.
5. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the problem of case sensitivity in table_exists function.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic between table names.
2. Lack of case insensitivity check in comparing table names.

### Bug cause:
The bug arises because the `table_exists` function does not consider case insensitivity when comparing table names, leading to mismatches between expected and actual output in the failing tests.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the input table name and the table names extracted from the stdout to be case-insensitive. By applying lower() to both names, we can ensure that the comparison is consistent and the function behaves correctly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By correcting the comparison in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive, the function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue raised in GitHub.
