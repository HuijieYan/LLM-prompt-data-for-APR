### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` does not handle case sensitivity properly, leading to failing tests when comparing table names.
2. The failing test cases demonstrate the issue where the function fails to handle case-insensitive table name comparisons.
3. The error message indicates that the assertion fails because the returned value from the function is not the expected outcome due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the stdout is case insensitive.
5. The GitHub issue raised by Lin discusses the same problem and suggests a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for comparison.
2. Implement the changes recommended in the GitHub issue #896 to address the case sensitivity.
3. Update the function to handle case-insensitive comparisons correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case insensitive by converting both strings to lowercase, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
