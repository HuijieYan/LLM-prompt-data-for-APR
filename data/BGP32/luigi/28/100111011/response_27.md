After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the returned table name from Hive. To fix this bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the returned table name to lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We convert both the provided `table` name and the table names returned in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison using `.lower()` to make the comparison case insensitive.
- For the partition case, we directly return `bool(stdout)` to check if there are any partitions.

By making this change, the function should now handle table existence checks in a case-insensitive manner and pass the failing tests.
