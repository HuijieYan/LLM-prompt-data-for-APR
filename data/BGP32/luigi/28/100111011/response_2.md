### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to correctly determine if a table exists in the database due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The failing tests in the `hive_test.py` file are checking for table existence with different cases like 'mytable', 'MyTable', etc.
3. The buggy function compares the exact table name without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the cases do not match.
4. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion fails because False is not evaluated as true.
5. The bug is related to the case sensitivity of the table names when checking for existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function's comparison of the table name directly without considering case insensitivity. This results in false negatives when the table name cases do not match what is returned from the command.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to make the table name comparison case insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function will accurately determine the existence of the table, regardless of the case. This fix aligns with the suggested solution in the GitHub issue #896.
