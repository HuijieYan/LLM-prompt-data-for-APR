### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between `table` and `stdout` might be case-sensitive.
2. The handling of partitioned tables might be incorrect.
3. The formatting of the Hive queries might not be consistent.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the case-sensitive comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` value, causing the test to fail when they don't match due to case differences. This issue was identified in the GitHub issue where Hive is case-insensitive but the function was not handling this properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` name and the `stdout` value are compared in a case-insensitive manner. Modifying the comparison logic to consider case insensitivity should resolve the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison with the lowercase versions of `table` and `stdout`, the function will now correctly handle the case-insensitive nature of Hive tables. This correction should address the failing test cases and align with the fix proposed in the GitHub issue.
