### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly, leading to failing test cases.
2. The failing test cases are designed to test the behavior of `table_exists` when checking for table existence with different case variations of the table names.
3. The failing test cases, along with the error message, indicate that the function is not handling case sensitivity properly, causing assertions to fail.
4. The GitHub issue discusses the nature of the problem, suggesting a solution to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive when comparing table names from `stdout`.
5. The solution involves converting the table name to lowercase before comparison with the output from Hive, ensuring case insensitivity.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the `table_exists` function not considering the case sensitivity of table names when comparing them with Hive output. This leads to failing assertions in the test cases that rely on case-insensitive table existence checks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparing it with the output from Hive. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the issue raised in the failing test cases and the GitHub discussion.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected function for table_exists in luigi/contrib/hive.py
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, the function now handles case sensitivity properly and should pass the failing test cases mentioned above.
