### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive. The function currently checks if the exact table name is present in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` command, causing issues when the case of the table name is different. The failing test cases demonstrate this problem by showing that even though the table exists, the function fails due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is in the comparison logic where the function checks if the table name is in the output string without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to incorrectly determine if the table exists or not based on the case of the table name.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing test cases fail because the function does a direct comparison between the table name and the output from the command without considering case sensitivity. When the table name's case does not match exactly with the output, the function incorrectly determines that the table does not exist, leading to an assertion error in the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the command needs to be case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function can accurately determine if the table exists regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, the corrected function will be able to correctly identify if the table exists in a case-insensitive manner.
