### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is not handling case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
2. The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` is failing due to case sensitivity in the comparison.
3. The error message indicates that the `AssertionError` is raised when expecting `True` but receiving `False` due to case mismatch.
4. The GitHub issue #896 highlights the need to make `table_exists` case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not converting the table names to lowercase before comparing them, leading to case sensitivity issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will be case insensitive, resolving the bug and making the test cases pass successfully.
