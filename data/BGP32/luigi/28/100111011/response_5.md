The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that it is not handling case sensitivity properly when comparing the table names from stdout. Due to this, the test cases fail when trying to check for tables that have different casing.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the `table` with the tables retrieved from the `stdout`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function so that it converts both the `table` and tables from `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and tables from `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison, which will resolve the test failures related to table name casing.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to case insensitivity in `table_exists` function.
