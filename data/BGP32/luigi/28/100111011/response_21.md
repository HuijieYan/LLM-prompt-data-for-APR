### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is failing the tests due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database and returns `True` if the table exists, otherwise `False`.
3. The failing tests in `hive_test.py` are expecting case-insensitive behavior, i.e., the function should return `True` even if the case of the table name does not match exactly with the one in the database.
4. The failing test cases provide input values and expected outcomes for different scenarios to validate the function's behavior.
5. The GitHub issue #896 and its description highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to address this problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive, which results in case sensitivity issues. The function should compare lowercased versions of the table name and the output to ensure case insensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the function `table_exists` to convert both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive and pass the failing test cases.
