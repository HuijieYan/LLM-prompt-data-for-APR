### Buggy Function Explanation:

The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive commands without considering case differences. This causes the function to fail when the table name case does not match exactly with the output.

### Bug Location:

The bug is located in the comparison statement where the function checks if the table exists in the stdout.

### Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by the lack of case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the stdout from Hive commands. When the table name case does not match exactly, the function fails to correctly identify the table's presence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, modify the comparison process to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the tables listed in the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in [t.lower() for t in stdout.split()]
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the tables in the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the function can correctly identify the existence of a table in a case-insensitive manner.
