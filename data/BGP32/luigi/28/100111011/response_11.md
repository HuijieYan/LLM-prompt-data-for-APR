### Identified issues in the buggy function:
1. The current implementation of the `table_exists` function does not handle case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command.
2. The buggy function does not consider converting the table name to lowercase for comparison, leading to test failures when the case does not match.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function not handling case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. If the table name's case does not match exactly with the output from the Hive command, the comparison fails, leading to test failures.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table name is converted to lowercase before comparing it with the output from the Hive command. This will make the comparison case-insensitive and resolve the issue with failing tests related to table existence.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing, we ensure a case-insensitive match. This corrected version should resolve the failing tests related to table existence and align with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
