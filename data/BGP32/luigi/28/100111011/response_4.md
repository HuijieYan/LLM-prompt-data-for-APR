### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is failing to handle case sensitivity issues when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The failing test cases are encountering assertions where the function should return `True` but is returning `False`.
3. The bug is due to the function not considering case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the Hive output with the input table name.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in the Hive output is case-insensitive.

### Correction:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version converts both the input table name and the names listed in the Hive output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- By using `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split())`, we ensure that the comparison is not affected by case differences.
- This correction addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue and aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub discussion.

By implementing this corrected version, the `table_exists` function should now handle case sensitivity properly and pass the failing test cases listed.
