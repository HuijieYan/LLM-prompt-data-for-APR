### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` in `luigi/contrib/hive.py` fails to handle case insensitivity when checking if a table exists in Hive.
- The failing test `test_table_exists` in `test/contrib/hive_test.py` demonstrates the scenario where the test case is failing due to case sensitivity in table names.
- The error message states that `AssertionError: False is not true`.
- The GitHub issue related to this bug discusses the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive to resolve the failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase before checking if it exists in the Hive output.
- By ensuring that both the table name and the output from Hive are in the same case (lowercase), we can address the case sensitivity issue.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the `table_exists` function is now case insensitive, as discussed in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported bug.
