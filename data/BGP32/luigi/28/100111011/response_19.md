### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command might not be case insensitive, leading to test failures when there are case differences.
2. The logic to handle the partitioned case might not be functioning correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command being case sensitive. This causes the test to fail when the table names are in different cases. Additionally, the partitioned case might not be adequately handled.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison between the table name and the Hive command output to be case insensitive.
2. Ensure that the partitioned case logic is correct and returns the expected results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive (using `lower()`), the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue raised in the GitHub post.
