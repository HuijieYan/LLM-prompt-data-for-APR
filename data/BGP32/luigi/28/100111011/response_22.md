### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This results in failing tests where the expected table names are not matched due to case differences.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the `table` with `stdout` in a case-sensitive manner.
2. Inconsistency in handling case sensitivity for table names.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without considering case differences. This causes the function to return incorrect results when the case of the table name does not match the case in the Hive output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the Hive output is done in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now handle case insensitivity correctly.

### GitHub Issue Resolution:
The bug fix aligns with the GitHub issue #896, which suggests making `table_exists` case insensitive to address this specific problem. The updated function corresponds to the proposed solution in the GitHub issue.

By implementing this fix, the function should now pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue in table existence checks in Hive.
