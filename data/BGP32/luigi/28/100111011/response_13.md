### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the comparison of the `table` name with the tables in `stdout`.
2. In the handling of case sensitivity for table names.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the lack of case insensitivity when comparing the `table` name with the tables present in the `stdout`. In the failing test case, the `table` name may not match exactly due to case differences, resulting in the assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the tables extracted from `stdout` is case insensitive. By converting both the `table` name and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase or uppercase before comparison, we can prevent case-related failures.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, before checking if the `table` is in `stdout`, both the `table` and the tables in `stdout` are converted to lowercase using `map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())` to ensure a case-insensitive comparison. This modification aligns with the proposed fix in the GitHub issue. By making this adjustment, the function should now pass the failing test cases related to case sensitivity.
