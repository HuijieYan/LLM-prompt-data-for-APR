## Analysis:
- The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. 
- The bug occurs when the function fails to account for case sensitivity in table names.
- The failing test cases are based on the expectation that the function should be case-insensitive.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning `False` instead of `True` in case-insensitive scenarios.
- The GitHub issue and description highlight the need to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function comparing the table name directly with the output from the Hive command without converting both to a consistent case.
- The function does not handle case-insensitive comparisons, leading to test failures.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function to convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to a consistent case (lowercase) before comparing.
- Implement a case-insensitive comparison to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
- Update the function to reflect the changes suggested in the GitHub issue for making `table_exists` case insensitive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected `table_exists` function will now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
