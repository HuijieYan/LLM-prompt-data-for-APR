Based on the information provided, the cause of the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to case sensitivity when comparing table names from the output of the command with the provided table name. The function does not handle case insensitivity, leading to test failures when comparing table names with different cases.

To address this issue and make the function case insensitive, a simple fix would be to convert both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output from the command to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case insensitive, resolving the issue of failing tests when comparing table names with different cases.

This corrected version should address the test failures mentioned and align with the GitHub issue discussions related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
