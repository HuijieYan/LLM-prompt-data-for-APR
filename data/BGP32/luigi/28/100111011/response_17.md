## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `hive.py` file is not handling the case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in the Hive database.
2. The failing test cases in the `hive_test.py` file are validating the table existence based on case-sensitive comparison, resulting in assertion errors.
3. The issue is related to the discrepancy in case sensitivity between the table name and the returned value from the Hive query.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the buggy function `table_exists` not performing a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the values retrieved from the Hive database.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the values obtained from the Hive query.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))` in the corrected function, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the retrieved values from the Hive query.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised in the GitHub tickets #896 and the case-insensitivity problem.
