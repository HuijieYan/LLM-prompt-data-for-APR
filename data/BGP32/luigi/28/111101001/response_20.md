The bug in the provided function `table_exists` lies in the comparison of the table name in the stdout. It is currently checking if the whole table name is present in the stdout, which may lead to incorrect results when there are multiple table names or similar names causing a partial match.

To fix the bug, we should split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines. This approach will ensure an exact match with the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now splits the stdout into lines and checks if the table name is present in any of those lines, providing a more accurate result. This should fix the failing test cases related to the `table_exists` function.
