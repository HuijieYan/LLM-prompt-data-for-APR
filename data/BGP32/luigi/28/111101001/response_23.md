The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the inconsistency in checking for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function assumes that the table name will be the only line in the output if the table exists, but this is not always the case, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, we should modify the logic to properly check for the existence of the table in the output. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_str = ' AND '.join(['%s=%s' % (k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and checking if the table is in the list of lines, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table. This correction should address the failing tests by accurately determining whether a table exists in the given Hive context.
