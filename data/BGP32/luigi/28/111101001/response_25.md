### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug in how it checks for the existence of a table in the database using the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable after executing the `run_hive_cmd` command.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first case, when the `table_exists` function is called with the table name 'mytable', the `run_hive_cmd` returns 'OK', but the function wrongly evaluates it as `True` and incorrectly determines that the table exists.

2. In the second case, with the table name 'MyTable', the `run_hive_cmd` returns 'OK\nmytable'. The function incorrectly evaluates this as `True` because it only checks if the table name is in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity, leading to a false positive.

3. In the third case, a similar issue occurs as in the first case but with different input values.

4. In the fourth case, the same issue as in the second case occurs with different input values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function processes the `stdout` variable returned by `run_hive_cmd`. We should check for the exact table name in the output and consider case sensitivity to accurately determine if the table exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
    
        return any(partition.items() <= dict(p.split('=') for p in part.split('/')).items() for part in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By using `table.lower()` and `map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))`, we ensure case-insensitive comparison when checking for the table name in the `stdout`. Additionally, in the partition check, we compare the key-value pairs individually to handle the partition data correctly. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
