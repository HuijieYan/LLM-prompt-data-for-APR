The bug in the provided `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks if the table exists in the Hive database. The function is comparing the table name directly to the stdout output, which may lead to incorrect results due to formatting issues.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly check if the table name exists in the stdout output by splitting the stdout into lines and then checking for the exact match.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function splits the stdout by lines and then checks if the table name is present in any of the lines returned. This modification ensures that the function correctly determines if the table exists in the Hive database.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided, ensuring the proper functionality of the `table_exists` method.
