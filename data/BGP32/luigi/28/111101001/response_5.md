### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is incorrectly checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The bug arises due to the incorrect logic in processing the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

1. In the provided test cases, the function is supposed to return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise. However, the logic in the `table_exists` function is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

2. The function incorrectly checks if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without proper parsing. This leads to inaccurate results when the table name is part of a larger output string.

3. In Case 2 and Case 4, even though the table name exists in the stdout, the function incorrectly evaluates the condition, leading to a failed test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to properly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists. We should check if the table name exists as a standalone entry in the output string.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Fix the buggy table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string on newline characters and checking if the table name exists in the resulting list, we ensure that we are correctly validating the existence of the table. This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the test cases.
