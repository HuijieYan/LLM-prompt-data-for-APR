The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it is not properly checking if the table exists in the output obtained from running the Hive command. The function currently only checks if the table name is in the output, but it does not handle case insensitivity. To fix this issue, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The key change here is in the `return` statement where we check if the lowercase version of the table name matches any of the table names obtained from the output. This change will ensure that the function is case-insensitive when checking for the table's existence.

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
