The bug in the `table_exists` function is that the comparison `table in stdout` may not work as expected due to potential formatting differences in the `stdout` variable that comes from the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The function is checking for an exact match of the table name within the `stdout`, but if there are additional characters or whitespaces around the table name in the `stdout`, the comparison will fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `table_exists` function to check if the table name appears in the lines of the `stdout`, rather than exact matching. This way, we can handle cases where there might be additional characters or whitespace around the table name in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version uses `any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))` to check if the table name exists in any line of the `stdout`. This allows for more flexibility in matching the table name within the `stdout`.

By making this change, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
