The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the condition to check if the table exists or not. The function checks if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function by directly checking `table in stdout`, which could lead to incorrect results due to partial matches.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check for exact matches of the table name in the output. We can split the stdout by newlines and then check if any of the items exactly match the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return table in stdout.split("\n")
        else:
            return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newlines and checks for an exact match of the table name, ensuring more accurate results.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
