The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way it checks if the table exists in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug is related to the comparison of the table name in the stdout, where it incorrectly checks if the table name is in the entire string, leading to false negatives for some cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic by splitting the stdout into lines and then checking if the table name is present in any of those lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newlines and checks if the `table` is present in any line. This ensures that the function accurately determines if the table exists based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

By making this modification, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
