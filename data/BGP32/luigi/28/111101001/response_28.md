The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the way it checks for the existence of a table in the database. The function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, but this comparison is not case-insensitive, leading to failing tests for tables with different casing.

To fix this bug, we should first modify the function to make the table name comparison case-insensitive. This can be done by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before checking for existence.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function should now pass the failing tests for table existence with different casing.

This correction ensures that tables with different casing are correctly identified without causing test failures.
