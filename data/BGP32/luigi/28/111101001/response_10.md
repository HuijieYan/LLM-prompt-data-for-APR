### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the logic used to check for the existence of a table. The function is checking if the table name is present in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may lead to inconsistencies in checking for table existence.

1. In the first case, when the table name is `'mytable'`, and stdout is `'OK'`, the function should return False because the table does not exist. However, the current implementation returns True due to the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`.

2. Similarly, in the second case when the table name is `'MyTable'`, the function should return True because the table exists in the stdout. However, it returns False due to the case sensitivity issue in string comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to properly handle the stdout from `run_hive_cmd` and compare the table names case-insensitively to ensure accurate table existence checks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the comparison to be case-insensitive and returning the boolean value of `stdout` directly, we ensure that the function correctly checks for table existence. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
