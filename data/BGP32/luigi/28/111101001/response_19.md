The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking logic, where the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, regardless of whether the `table` is actually present in `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to explicitly check if the `table` is present in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout and table in stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making this change, the corrected `table_exists` function will now properly check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` before returning `True`.

This correction should address the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
