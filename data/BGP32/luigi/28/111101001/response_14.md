### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it incorrectly checks if the table exists in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`. In the buggy function:
1. In the first case, the check if the table exists in the stdout is incorrect as it only performs a simple 'in' check, which may result in false positives.
2. In the second case, the table name comparison is case-sensitive, leading to incorrect results.
3. In both cases, the logic to check if the table exists based on the stdout is flawed and does not handle the cases properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to ensure that the function accurately checks if the table exists in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`. This can be achieved by improving the comparison logic and handling case-insensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now properly checks if the table exists in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`. It uses case-insensitive comparisons and checks each table name in the stdout to accurately determine the existence of the table. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
