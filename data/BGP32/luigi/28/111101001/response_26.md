The bug in the provided code lies in the `table_exists` function where the condition to check if a table exists is not working correctly. The function is checking if the table name is in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function, but it's not handling the case where the table name is a subset of another table name in the stdout.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition to check for exact matches of the table name in the stdout, rather than just checking if it's a substring. We can achieve this by splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking if the exact table name is present in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the stdout by newline characters and checks if the exact table name is present in the list of tables. This modification ensures that the function correctly determines if the table exists in the database.

After implementing this fix, the provided failing tests should now pass without any issues.
