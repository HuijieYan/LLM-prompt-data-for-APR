### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not correctly checking for table existence in the Hive database. The issue arises from the `if stdout:` condition, which always evaluates to True as long as `stdout` is not an empty string. This causes the function to always return True, even when the table is not actually found in the database.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the table exists in the Hive database based on the actual content of the `stdout` variable. We should check if the table name is explicitly present in the output returned from the Hive command.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        if not partition:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
```

By making the above modifications, the function will correctly check for the presence of the table name in the output received from the Hive command, ensuring the expected behavior according to the provided test cases. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
