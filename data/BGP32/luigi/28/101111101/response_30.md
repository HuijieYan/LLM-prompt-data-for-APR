The bug in the provided function lies in the logic that checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The function wrongly assumes that only the table name is given and ignores the case where a partition is also specified. This leads to incorrect output and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to handle both cases where a partition is specified and where it is not. We need to adjust the function to properly check for the existence of the table within the specified database under the given conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and 'OK' in stdout
```

By updating the function as shown above, it now correctly handles the cases where a partition is specified, ensuring that the table existence check is done accurately.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
