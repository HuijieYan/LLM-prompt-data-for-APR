### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the way the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked. It expects the output to contain the entire list of tables/partitions, which may not always be the case. We need to modify the check to be more robust and properly handle the cases where the table/partition may be part of a larger string in the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return partition_spec in stdout
```

In the corrected version, we split the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function by newline characters and check if the specified table/partition is present in the list. This approach makes the function more resilient to variations in the output format.
