The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. The current implementation checks if the `stdout` is not empty and then confirms the table's existence. However, this logic is flawed as even if the `stdout` contains other irrelevant information or whitespace, the function will consider the table as existing just by being present in `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to check for the exact match of the table name in the lines of `stdout`. This way, we ensure that the function accurately determines the table's existence based on the precise information provided in the `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking for the exact presence of the table name in those lines, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence. This modification aligns the function's behavior with the expected output values for all the failing test cases provided.
