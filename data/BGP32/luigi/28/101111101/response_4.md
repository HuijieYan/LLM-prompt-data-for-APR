The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`, which is incorrect. The condition should check if the table name is in the lines of stdout, not just in the entire string.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `stdout` by lines and then check if the `table` string is in any of those lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

        return True if stdout else False
``` 

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and then checks if the `table` is in any of those lines. This change should fix the bug and make the function work as expected with the failing tests provided.
