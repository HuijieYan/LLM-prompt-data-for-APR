The bug in the provided code is due to how the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked and processed. The `run_hive_cmd` function returns a string output that needs to be verified properly to determine if the table exists or not. In the buggy function, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is problematic as it might lead to false positives.

To fix this bug, we need to check for the presence of the table name as a whole word in the output string. One way to do this is to split the output string by line and then check if any of the lines exactly match the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return any(line == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` string by line before checking for the presence of the table name. This approach ensures that we are looking for an exact match of the table name in the output.

By applying this fix, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
