The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the way it checks for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function checks if the table name is present in the output of the Hive command, but it doesn't handle the case where the table name might be a substring of another table name present in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for the existence of the table by considering the full line of the table name in the Hive command output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        partition_clause = ' '.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, partition_clause)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)

        return bool(stdout)
```

The fix ensures that the function checks if the provided table name matches exactly with any full line of the tables present in the output of the Hive command.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
