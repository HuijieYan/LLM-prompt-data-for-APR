The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison in the `if` condition as `table in stdout`. This condition will return `True` even if the table name is part of a longer string, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we should split the `stdout` string into lines and check if the exact table name is present in one of those lines. Additionally, we should consider case insensitivity for table names.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            for t in tables:
                if t.strip().lower() == table.lower():
                    return True
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function checks each line of the output individually to see if the exact table name is present, ensuring accurate results. Additionally, it considers case insensitivity for table names.

After applying this fix, the failing tests should pass without any issues.
