### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to correctly determine if a table exists in a database in Hive. The bug is related to how the function handles the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function and how it checks for the presence of the table name in that output.

In the failing test cases, the issue arises when the function tries to determine if a table exists by looking at the `stdout` obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the table is found in the `stdout`, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Explanation:
- In Case 2 and Case 5, the `stdout` contains the table name "mytable" among other output. The buggy function incorrectly processes this output and returns `False` instead of `True`.
- The comparison `return stdout and table in stdout` is flawed as it checks if both `stdout` is not empty and the table name exists in `stdout`, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to adjust the conditional statements to properly handle the comparison of the table name with the output obtained from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')  # Split the output by newline
            
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Just check if stdout has some content

```

By modifying the comparison logic to split the `stdout` output by newline and check if the table name exists among the lines, we can ensure that the function correctly determines if a table exists in Hive. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected results.
