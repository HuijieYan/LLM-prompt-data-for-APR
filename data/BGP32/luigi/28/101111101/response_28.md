## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the return condition not handling the case where the table is present in the `stdout`. The function checks if the `stdout` response is empty or not, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where the table is present in the `stdout` response but not at the beginning of the line.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if the table is present in the `stdout` response. Instead of just checking if the table name is in the `stdout`, we need to split the `stdout` by lines and check if the table name is present in any of the lines.

## Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By modifying the condition to iterate over each line in the `stdout` response and check if the table name matches any line after stripping extra whitespace, we can fix the buggy behavior. This updated function will correctly determine if the table exists based on any non-empty line containing the table name.
