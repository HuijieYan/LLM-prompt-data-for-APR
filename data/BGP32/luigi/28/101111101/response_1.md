The issue in the buggy function lies in the conditional checks and the comparison of the stdout variable. The function is not handling the cases properly where there is extra output or different case in the table names in the stdout.

The buggy function is failing because it checks for an exact match of the table name in the stdout, and when the name is not exactly the same or if there is extra output present, it fails to return the correct result.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle cases where there might be additional information in the stdout or when the case of the table name is different.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(t.strip().lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        partition_query = " AND ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_query))

        return stdout is not None and stdout.strip() != ""
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case where partition is None, we split the stdout by lines and check if any table name (case-insensitive) matches the provided table name.
- For the case where partition is not None, we construct the partition query and check if the stdout is not empty.

This updated version should now correctly handle the variations in the table names and additional output, fixing the failing tests.
