The issue with the buggy function `table_exists` lies in the logic that checks for the presence of the table name within the stdout. The current implementation uses the `in` operator to check for an exact match, leading to failures in cases where the table name is part of a larger string in the stdout.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic to properly handle the cases where the table name could be part of a larger string, ensuring an exact match. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters, we ensure that we only check for an exact match of the table name in the list of tables retrieved from the command output.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values that were identified.
