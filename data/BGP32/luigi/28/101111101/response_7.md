The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the function checks for the existence of a table in Hive. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks if the table name is present in the output. However, the current implementation fails in scenarios where the table name appears within another string in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for checking table existence to ensure that it matches the exact table name and not just a substring.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}"'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1}'.format(database, table))
        if stdout:
            return any(partition.items() <= dict(p.split('=')) for p in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            return False
```

The key changes made in the corrected version include:
1. Using `split()` on the `stdout` to ensure an exact match for the table name.
2. Parsing the partition values from the output and checking if the provided partition specification exists.

These modifications address the bug and ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of tables and partitions in Hive. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
