The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison logic where `table in stdout` is used. With the current implementation, the function checks if the table name is in the entire output string, which can lead to false positives. Instead, we should check if the table name appears as a separate entity in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison condition to ensure an exact match with the table name, rather than a substring match. Let's update the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function now splits the stdout by newline characters and checks if the table name is an exact match in the list of tables, ensuring that false positives are prevented. This change should address the failing tests and match the expected behavior.
