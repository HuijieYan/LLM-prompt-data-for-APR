The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, but the condition is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the table name may be a substring of another table name in the output. This leads to failing test cases where the expected table is found in the `stdout` as a substring rather than an exact match.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check to ensure that the table name in the `stdout` is an exact match with the provided `table`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            partitions = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partitions))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, we split the `stdout` by lines to ensure that we are comparing each table name individually. Also, we retrieve the partitions before running the command to show partitions, which is more readable and organized.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
