The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` variable. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` does not correctly check if the table exists in the output of the command. Instead, it just checks if `stdout` is not empty.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly parse the output of the command and check if the table exists in it.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases provided. It correctly splits the `stdout` output by newline characters and checks if the table exists in the list of tables returned by the command.

Make sure to update the buggy function in your code with this corrected version to resolve the issue.
