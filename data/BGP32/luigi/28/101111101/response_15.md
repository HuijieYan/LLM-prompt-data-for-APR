The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the condition for checking table existence in the Hive database. The problem lies in how the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function is being evaluated. The function currently checks if the output contains the table name at any position, leading to false positives. To fix this, we need to ensure that the table name is matched exactly without being part of another string.

To correct the function, we will modify the condition for checking table existence by splitting the stdout into lines and then checking if the table name appears exactly as a standalone string in one of the lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By splitting the stdout into lines and checking if the table exists exactly in one of those lines, we can ensure a more accurate check for table existence.

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases.
