The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks for the presence of the `table` name in the stdout, leading to the assertion errors in the failing tests. The buggy function checks for an exact match of the `table` name in the `stdout`, which causes issues when the `table` name is a substring of another line in the `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of checking if the `table` is present in the `stdout` properly. One way to do this is to split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if any line contains the `table` name as a whole word. We can use regular expressions to perform this check.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
import re

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(re.match(r'\b{}\b'.format(table), line) for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of erroneous matches and should now pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
