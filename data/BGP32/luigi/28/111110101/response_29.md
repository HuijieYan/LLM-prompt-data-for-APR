### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a database by querying Hive.
3. The buggy function has an issue where it does not properly handle the output of the Hive command.
4. In the failing test, the function fails to correctly determine if a table exists because of the way it evaluates the output of the Hive command.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how it handles the output of the Hive command. The function expects specific strings in the output to determine if a table exists, but the comparison is not accurate, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we should modify the logic to correctly parse the output of the Hive command and determine table existence based on that. We can refine the string comparison logic to accurately check for table names in the output.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables like '{1}';".format(database, table))

        return bool(stdout.strip())  # check if stdout contains any content
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout.strip())  # check if stdout contains any content
```

By using the `strip()` method on the `stdout` variable and then converting the resulting value to a boolean, we ensure that we are accurately checking if the output contains any relevant information.

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output results.
