### Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class, which inherits from `HiveClient`.
- The function calls `run_hive_cmd`, passing different commands based on the presence of the `partition` parameter.
- In the failing test, the function is called with different inputs and the expected values are determined based on the return value of `run_hive_cmd`.

### Bug
- In the buggy function, the condition checking for the presence of `table in stdout` is incorrect. It should check if `table` is in the lines of the `stdout` string since the output may contain more than just the table name.
- The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is always evaluated as `True` because non-empty strings are truthy in Python.

### Fix
- Modify the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` to `return stdout and table + '\n' in stdout` to check for the table name in the lines of the `stdout`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table + '\n' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

After this correction, the `table_exists` function should pass all the provided test cases.
