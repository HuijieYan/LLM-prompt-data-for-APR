### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic to check if a table exists in the Hive database. The function fails to correctly parse the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine if the table exists or not. This leads to incorrect return values and causes the test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test case, the function is called with a table name `"MyTable"`, which should exist, but the function incorrectly returns `False`.
2. The issue lies in the way it handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. It checks if the table name is present in the stdout which causes the failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic of how the function processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should split the stdout by the newline character to handle multiple table listings properly. Then we should check if the table name exists in the list of tables.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline character and then checking if the `table` is in the list, the corrected function should now pass all the failing test cases and return the expected values based on the input parameters.
