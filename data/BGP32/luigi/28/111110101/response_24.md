### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table or partition exists in the specified database using Hive commands. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive queries.

The bug in the function lies in the conditional statements when processing the output from the Hive commands. The function checks for the presence of the table or partition in the output but does not handle different cases properly.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test, the mock `run_command` returns "OK" for the first call to `table_exists("mytable")`. The function incorrectly returns `False` because it checks for `table in stdout`, which is not the case here. The expected output should be `True`.
- In the same failing test, the second call to `table_exists("mytable")` receives a mock return value of "OK\nmytable". The function incorrectly returns `False` because it tries to match the table name exactly in the output. The expected output should be `True`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic inside the function to correctly handle the output from Hive commands.
2. Update the return statements to reflect the expected behavior based on the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
  
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables'.format(database))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # If stdout is not empty, return True

```

By splitting the stdout by newlines and checking for the table name in each line, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the table existence. Additionally, by using `bool(stdout)` for the partition case, we return `True` if the stdout is not empty. 

These changes should make the function return the correct results for all test cases.
