### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table using the `run_hive_cmd` function, either for a whole table or with a specific partition.
2. The function makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` based on the presence of a partition. If there is no partition, it runs a command to check for the table directly. If there is a partition, it constructs a more complex command to check for the table with that partition.
3. The failing test cases expect the function to correctly identify the existence of tables and handle partitions properly. The errors indicate that the function is not returning the expected boolean value.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the stdout response from `run_hive_cmd`, leading to incorrect boolean evaluation based on table existence.

### Solution:
1. In the buggy function, the problem seems to be with the evaluation of the variable `stdout` to determine table existence. We need to ensure that the stdout response is appropriately processed to return the correct boolean value.
2. It appears that the function should return `True` if the table is found in the stdout, and `False` otherwise. The current implementation may not be handling this check correctly.
3. We will modify the function to properly check for the existence of the table in the stdout string returned by `run_hive_cmd` and return the appropriate boolean value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
``` 

By splitting the stdout response on newlines and then checking for the presence of the table, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table even with partitions. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and return the expected boolean values.
