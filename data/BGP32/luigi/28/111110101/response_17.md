The buggy function `table_exists` has a logic error where it is not correctly handling the case when the `stdout` variable is not empty. The function should return `True` in that case, but it is not doing so. This leads to the failing test cases because the function incorrectly returns `False` when it should be `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to properly handle the case when `stdout` is not empty. We can check if `stdout` is not None and contains the table name in the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout is not None and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout is not None
```

By checking if `stdout` is not None in the return statements, we ensure that the function will return `True` when the table is found in the output and not just when `stdout` is not empty.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
