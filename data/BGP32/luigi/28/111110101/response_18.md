The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue where it returns the opposite boolean value than expected in some cases. This is causing the failing test cases to show errors where `False is not true`. 

The logic in the `if` block of the function is mistakenly returning `True` when it should be `False` and vice versa.

To fix this, we will correct the logic in the `if` block to return `False` when `stdout` is empty or `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout is not None and stdout != ""
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases, ensuring that the expected input/output values are met for all scenarios.
