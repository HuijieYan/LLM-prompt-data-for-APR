### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a Hive database by running Hive commands.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the Hive commands.
3. The bug occurs when the function tries to determine if a table exists with or without partitions.
4. The bug leads to incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable, which is used to check for the existence of the table.
5. The failing test cases reveal inconsistencies in the function's logic and response to different scenarios.

### Bug:
The bug is in how the function processes the `stdout` variable after executing Hive commands. Specifically, the bug causes incorrect boolean evaluation based on the `stdout`.

### Solution:
To address the bug, we need to update the logic for checking the existence of the table in the Hive database and handle the `stdout` responses correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {}; show partitions {};""".format(database, table))
            partition_str = ', '.join(['{}=\'{}\''.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            return partition_str in stdout if stdout else False
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, the function now properly handles the output received from executing Hive commands.
2. When checking for the existence of a table without partitions, the function checks if the table is in the `stdout`.
3. When checking for the existence of a table with partitions, the function constructs a partition string and checks if it is in the `stdout`.
4. By handling the `stdout` response accurately, the function can now correctly determine the existence of tables in the Hive database.
