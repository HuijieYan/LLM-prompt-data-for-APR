### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run commands on a Hive database to check for the existence of a table or partition.
2. The buggy function fails to correctly handle the responses from the `run_hive_cmd` function and determine the existence of the specified table or partition.
3. The failing test cases indicate that the buggy function is not returning the correct response for different scenarios leading to assertion errors.
4. The key issue seems to be with the logic of handling the command response and checking for the existence of the table or partition in the output. The bug is caused by incorrect checking conditions and parsing of the stdout response.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect parsing of the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the logic for determining the table existence. The buggy function does not handle the stdout responses correctly, leading to incorrect results when checking for table existence.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the response from the `run_hive_cmd` function and check for the existence of the table or partition based on the response. We should update the function to properly handle both scenarios of table existence and non-existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n')

    stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    return bool(stdout)  # Directly return the boolean value of `stdout`
```

By splitting the stdout response on newline characters and then checking whether the table is in the list of tables, we ensure correct handling of both existing and non-existing table cases. The logic for partition checking can be simplified to return the boolean value directly.
