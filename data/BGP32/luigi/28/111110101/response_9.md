### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a certain table exists in a specified database, potentially with a partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the results.
3. The bug seems to be related to the condition for checking if the table exists, leading to incorrect results in the test cases.
4. The function incorrectly handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, which causes the assertions to fail in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the conditional checks in the function to correctly handle the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Ensure that the function properly evaluates the returned output to determine if the table exists.
3. Make adjustments to the conditions to align with the expected behavior outlined in the failing tests.
4. Verify that the function checks for the table existence accurately, considering both the table name and any existing partitions.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() != ""
```

By modifying the function to correctly handle the output from `run_hive_cmd` and ensuring that the conditions align with the expected behavior described in the failing tests, the corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
