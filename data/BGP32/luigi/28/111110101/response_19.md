### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing to return the correct result for table existence checks. The issue seems to be related to the conditional check and the comparison with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Observation
- The first condition of the `if` block in the function is checking if `partition` is `None`, which is working correctly.
- The second condition handles the case where `partition` is not `None`. However, the way the output of `run_hive_cmd` is being checked is incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the bug in the conditional check after calling `run_hive_cmd` in the second part of the `if` block. The function is not properly handling the output in the case of partitions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly compare the output of `run_hive_cmd` with the table name when dealing with partitions. The function needs to correctly handle the output string and check if the table with the specified partition exists.

### Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected and updated version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        # Check if the partition is None
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly check for the existence of the table when a partition is provided, and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
