## Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check for the existence of the table.
3. The bug is likely in the logic used to determine if the table exists based on the output of the Hive command.
4. The failing test `test_table_exists` is trying to validate the behavior of the function with different scenarios.

## Bug Explanation
1. When calling the `table_exists` function with 'MyTable' as the table name, the function expects to return `True` but actually returns `False`.
2. This discrepancy occurs because the function checks for the exact presence of the table name in the Hive command output without considering case sensitivity.
3. In the failing scenario, the expected output is `'OK\nmytable'` as returned by `run_hive_cmd`, but the function fails to correctly identify 'MyTable' as present in the output.
4. The bug arises from the mismatch between case sensitivity of the input table name and the check for the table existence.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. To fix the bug, the function should consider case insensitivity when checking for the existence of the table in the Hive command output.
2. Modify the comparison operation to ignore the case of the table name during the check.
3. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the table as present regardless of the case of the input table name.

## Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s PARTITION
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By utilizing case insensitivity in the comparison operation and ensuring correct splitting of the command output, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
