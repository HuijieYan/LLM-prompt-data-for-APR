### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in a given database using a Hive command.
2. The function has two paths based on the presence of a partition parameter - one path for no partition and one for a partition.
3. The first condition queries Hive for tables and checks if the table exists in the output. The second condition queries Hive for partitions based on the table and partition spec and checks if any output exists.
4. The failing test cases expect proper identification of table existence based on the output of the Hive commands.

### Bug
The bug lies in the first condition of the `table_exists` function which checks if the table exists but the logic seems to be incorrect. The function returns `stdout and table in stdout` which will not correctly identify if the table exists in the Hive output or not. This leads to failing test cases.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly identify the table's presence in the Hive output. We should check for an exact match of the table name in the output string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table + '\n' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we check for an exact match of the table name in the stdout while searching for the table existence in the Hive output. This change ensures that the function is correctly identifying the presence of the table.
