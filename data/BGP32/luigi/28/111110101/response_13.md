The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the provided database. The issue lies in how the function constructs and evaluates the `stdout` variable after running the Hive command.

The bug occurs because the function is checking for the exact match of the table name in the output returned from the Hive command, without considering additional characters or newlines. This leads to the function returning incorrect results in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `stdout` variable is checked for the presence of the table name. We should split the `stdout` string on newline characters and then check if the table name exists in the list of lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout.strip() == table
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By using `stdout.strip() == table` in the first condition, we ensure that the table name is matched without any leading or trailing whitespace characters. This modification should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.

Please replace the existing `table_exists` function with this corrected version and re-run the failing test cases to verify that the bug has been fixed.
