## The analysis of the buggy function

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug that causes it to return incorrect results in some cases, leading to failing test cases.

The function has two main branches, one for when `partition` is `None` and another for when `partition` is not `None`. In both cases, the function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks the output to determine if the table exists.

The bug seems to be related to how the `table` existence check is performed based on the output of the Hive commands. The function does not correctly handle cases where the table name is part of a longer string or when multiple tables are included in the output.

## The cause of the bug

The bug occurs due to the way the function checks for the existence of the table in the output of the Hive commands. When the output contains multiple lines, the function only checks if the table name is exactly equal to one line of the output, leading to incorrect results.

In the failing test cases, the expected behavior should be to check if the table name is a standalone entry in the output, regardless of the formatting or presence of other lines.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of how the function checks for the presence of the table in the Hive command output. Instead of a direct string match, we should ensure that the table name appears as a separate entry in the output, separated by newlines.

Additionally, considering the test cases provided, we need to handle case insensitivity when comparing table names.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and any(line.strip().lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and any(line.strip().lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In the corrected version, we split the output of the Hive commands by newline characters and check if any of the lines match the table name (ignoring case). This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table in the command output.
