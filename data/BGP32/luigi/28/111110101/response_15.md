The buggy function `table_exists` is failing due to incorrect logic in handling the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the presence of the `table` in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, but it's not accounting for new line characters in the output. As a result, the comparison fails, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to consider new line characters when checking for the existence of the table.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` variable on new line characters to create a list of lines.
- We then check if the `table` exists in any of the lines by using `table in stdout.split('\n')` instead of directly checking in `stdout`.
- In the case where `partition` is not None, we simply return `bool(stdout)` since we don't need to check for the table name in this case.

With these changes, the function should now pass all the test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
