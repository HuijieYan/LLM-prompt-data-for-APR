The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic where it checks if a table exists in the output of a Hive command. The function returns True if the table is found in the stdout output, but it incorrectly returns False when the table is found, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the check for the presence of the table in the stdout. We should check if the table name is a whole word in the output instead of just being present in the string. We can achieve this by modifying the comparison logic to use regular expressions to match the whole word.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(re.escape(table)), stdout)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected function uses the `re.search` method with regex `\b{}\b` to match the whole word (table name) in the stdout. This ensures that the table exists check is more accurate.

After applying this correction, the function should pass all the failing test cases mentioned for different scenarios.
