### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to query the Hive database. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks the existence of a table based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table name exists in the output by doing a simple substring search, which can lead to incorrect results when multiple tables are listed in the output.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function checks for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Instead of a simple substring search, we should split the output by lines and check if the table name is in the list of tables.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return bool(partitions)
```

By splitting the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function by lines and checking each line for the table name, we ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table in the database. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
