### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a specific database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and retrieve output.
2. The function checks for the existence of a table based on whether a `partition` argument is provided or not.
3. The bug is present in the case where `partition` is None. In this case, the function fails to properly check the presence of the table in the stdout output.
4. The bug causes the function to return the opposite boolean value compared to the expected output, leading to failing test cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes the stdout output when `partition` is None. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. When the `partition` argument is None, we should modify the logic to check if the table is listed in the stdout after running the appropriate Hive command.
2. Update the return statement to return `True` if the table is found in stdout, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` output and checking if the table name is in the list (for the case when `partition` is None), the function will properly return `True` if the table is found in stdout, and `False` if it is not found.
