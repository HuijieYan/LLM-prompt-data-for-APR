### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases due to incorrect logic in checking the presence of the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
- The function `run_hive_cmd` is mocked in the test cases to return specific values when called. 
- The bug causes the function to return incorrectly for certain inputs.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the if conditions where the presence of the table name in the output of `run_hive_cmd` is being checked. The logic for checking the presence of the table name is causing the function to return incorrect values.

### Bug Explanation
- In the buggy function `table_exists`, when `run_hive_cmd` is called with a query to list tables for a given database, the function incorrectly checks if the table name is in the stdout by assuming that the output is the exact table name itself.
- In the second part of the function, when partitions are involved, the execution for checking the table existence also has an issue in creating the query to check the partitions.
- Due to these issues, the function fails to accurately determine the presence of the tables and partitions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the logic in the function to correctly parse and check the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
- Ensure that the function accounts for different formats of output that may contain additional details apart from just the table name.
- Correctly construct the query when checking for partitions to ensure accurate validation of table existence.

### Corrected Code

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0};'.format(database))

        # Split the stdout by newline and check if table exists
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})"""
                              .format(database, table, ', '.join('{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items())))

        # Check if stdout contains any partition information
        return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function utilizes correct parsing techniques to accurately detect the presence of tables and partitions. It splits the output of `run_hive_cmd` by newline character and appropriately checks for the table or partition existence.
