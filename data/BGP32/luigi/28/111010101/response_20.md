### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database.
2. The function makes a call to `run_hive_cmd` with different queries based on the presence of a `partition` parameter.
3. The failing test cases show that the function is not returning the correct values when checking if a table exists.
4. The bug is likely related to how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
5. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it doesn't. The issue seems to arise in the parsing of the output to determine existence.

### Bug:
The bug is in the comparison logic in the function's `if` condition. It does not correctly handle the different return values from `run_hive_cmd` when checking for table existence.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to correctly parse the output from `run_hive_cmd` and return `True` if the table exists in the database.
2. Modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the output to determine table existence accurately.

### Corrected code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_query = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, partition_query))
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```

This corrected version should now pass all the failing test cases by correctly checking whether the table exists in the given database.
