### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a specified database by running a Hive command. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the Hive command.
2. The function includes a conditional branch that checks if a partition is defined. If a partition is defined, it constructs a Hive command to show partitions based on the given partition specification.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the returned `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug is causing the function to sometimes return incorrect values, leading to failing test cases.
4. The bug is likely due to how the function handles the output `stdout` from the Hive command execution and the comparison logic based on that `stdout`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the `stdout` output is correct, taking into consideration potential differences in the returned output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Review the logic of extracting the expected output from the Hive command execution in the `table_exists` function.
- Adjust the comparison logic to correctly identify the existence of the table/partition based on the `stdout` output of the Hive command.
- Test the fixed function with the provided failing test cases to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Adjusted Hive command to correctly handle partitions
            partition_cmd = ' AND '.join(['{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_cmd))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The Hive command for checking partitions has been adjusted to construct the command correctly.
- The function now correctly checks if the `stdout` contains any output to determine if the table/partition exists.
- The return values are adjusted to ensure proper handling of the Hive command output.
