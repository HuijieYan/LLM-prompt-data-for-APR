### Analysis
- The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class.
- It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function defined outside the class to execute Hive commands.
- The function checks whether a table or partition exists in a Hive database based on the provided inputs.
- The error message indicates a failure in the test cases where the function is expected to return `True` but returns `False`.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause
- In the buggy function `table_exists`, when checking for a table's existence, it uses the condition `return stdout and table in stdout`. This condition checks if stdout has any content before checking if the table exists in that content.
- The bug occurs because the stdout might have a value that includes the table name, but the condition does not account for the possibility of a prefix or suffix in the output string.
- This results in the function sometimes returning `False` when it should return `True` if the table is present.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks whether the table name is a standalone word in the stdout. One approach could be checking each line of the stdout separately to find an exact match for the table name.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return any(line == table for line in stdout.splitlines())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
    
            return any(line.strip() == f'{table_partition}" for table_partition in stdout.splitlines())
```

The corrected version modifies how the function processes the stdout by splitting it into lines and checking each line separately for an exact match with the table name. This ensures that the function accurately determines if the table exists based on the provided stdout.
