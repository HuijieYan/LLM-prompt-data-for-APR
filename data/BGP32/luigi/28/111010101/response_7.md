### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is supposed to check whether a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output.
2. The function is failing the test cases due to incorrect checks for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the output of `run_hive_cmd` when checking for the existence of a table.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly parse the stdout output to determine if the table exists in the database.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Modify the condition to check if the table name is present in the stdout output after splitting it by newline characters.
2. Update the return logic to return `True` if the table name is found, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version

```python
# Corrected version of the table_exists function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function should resolve the bug by correctly checking the presence of the table name in the stdout output. It splits the stdout by newline characters and checks if the table name is in the list of tables.

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and provide the expected output for each case.
