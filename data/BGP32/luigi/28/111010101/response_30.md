### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists using Hive commands. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The error occurs when calling `self.assertTrue(returned)` in the test cases because the function is returning False even when it should be returning True.
3. The bug in the function is likely due to the comparison of the `stdout` response from the Hive command. The function expects the table name to be present in the `stdout` output to determine if the table exists or not. However, the checks for table existance are not being performed correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for checking the existence of the table in the `stdout` output before returning True or False.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            # Check if the table name exists in the stdout response
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            # Check if any partitions exist for the table
            return bool(stdout)
```

By implementing the corrections above, the function should now correctly check for the existence of tables using Hive commands, resolving the bug that caused the failing test cases.
