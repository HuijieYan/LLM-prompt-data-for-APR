#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a specific Hive database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function with a Hive command query.
2. The error message indicates that for the test cases involving table existence check (`test_table_exists` and `test_apacheclient_table_exists`), the function fails to return the correct result.
3. The bug is likely due to the comparison between the `stdout` result from `run_hive_cmd` and the table name. The function is checking if the table name is present in the `stdout`, but the comparison logic might be incorrect.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure the `table` name is correctly checked against the `stdout` string.
5. The corrected version of the function is below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string on newline characters and then checking if the `table` name is present in the obtained list, we can ensure that the correct comparison is made. This correction should address the bug and enable the function to return the expected results for the given test cases.
