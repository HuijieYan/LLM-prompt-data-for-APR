### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is calling the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
2. The failing test cases check if tables exist in the database by using the `table_exists` function and mocking the `run_hive_cmd` function to return specific values.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the `table_exists` function is checking for the existence of tables in the database and processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The bug is likely causing incorrect evaluation and return of the table existence status.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is likely due to incorrect handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 
- In the failing test cases, the expected values for table existence are not being evaluated correctly.
- The current implementation checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function, which may not provide an exact match due to newlines or additional characters.
- This leads to incorrect evaluation and causes the assertion errors in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function:
1. Modify the approach to check for table existence by properly parsing and matching the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Ensure that the function trims any extra characters or whitespace from the `stdout` variable to perform an exact match with the table name.
3. Handle newline characters or any formatting issues in the output before evaluating table existence.
4. Update the logic to return `True` if the table name is found in the output, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Function

```python
from typing import Union

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table: str, database='default', partition=None) -> bool:
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')

            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            partition_str = ",".join([f"{k}={v}" for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str})')

            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the `table_exists` function as shown above, we parse the output from `run_hive_cmd`, trim any extra characters, and perform an exact match with the table name to determine table existence accurately. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
