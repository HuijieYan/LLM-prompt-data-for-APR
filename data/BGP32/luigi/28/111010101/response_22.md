### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in the specified database using Hive commands.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
3. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to test failures. The function is not handling the case where the table name is included in the output but not an exact match.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the function checks if the table name is in the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
5. We need to consider possible variations in the output format from the Hive command to ensure accurate table existence checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the buggy function to handle variations in the output from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Modify the condition for checking table existence to be more robust.
3. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the table existence based on the output from Hive commands.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            # Check for exact match or if the table name is included in the output
            return stdout and (table in stdout or f'\n{table}\n' in stdout)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
            # Check for non-empty response to confirm table existence
            return bool(stdout)
```

By updating the conditional statements to handle variations in the output from Hive commands, the corrected function now correctly determines the existence of the specified table in the specified database. This should resolve the failing test cases.
