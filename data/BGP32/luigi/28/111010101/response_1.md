### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function in the same module to execute a Hive command.
2. The buggy function checks if a table exists in a given database. If a partition is provided, it also includes the partition information in the Hive command.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the stdout from the Hive command. The function checks if the table name is present in the stdout to determine if the table exists. The issue might be with the comparison logic.
4. The strategy to fix the bug would be to correctly parse the stdout from the Hive command and ensure that the table name is present in the output.
5. Based on the provided analysis, a corrected version of the `table_exists` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout  # Check if the table is present in the output
``` 

By checking if the table name is in the stdout directly for both cases (with or without partition), we ensure that the function correctly determines if a table exists by parsing the output from the Hive command. This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases.
