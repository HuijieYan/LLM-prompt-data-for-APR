1. **Analyzing the buggy function:**
The buggy function `table_exists` is a method inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. It checks whether a specified table exists in a given database. If a partition is provided, it also checks for the existence of that partition within the table. The function uses the helper function `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.

2. **Identifying potential error locations:**
- The bug may be related to how the `stdout` output is being checked for table existence.
- The condition `stdout and table in stdout` may not be handling the check correctly when the table name is part of a larger string.
- The condition for checking the presence of a partition may need refinement.

3. **Explaining the cause of the bug:**
- The error messages indicate that the function is failing to correctly determine the existence of tables based on the output received from `run_hive_cmd`.
- The error "AssertionError: False is not true" signifies that the function is expected to return `True` but is returning `False`.
- The expected output values provided in the failing test cases show that the function may not be correctly handling the output parsing and comparison logic.
  
4. **Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:**
- Improve the logic for checking the existence of tables and partitions in the `stdout` output string.
- Ensure that the function correctly parses the output to identify the table name and partitions if required.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).strip()
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).strip()
        return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected version:
- The stdout is stripped to remove any leading or trailing spaces.
- The `stdout` for both cases (table existence check and partition existence check) is correctly parsed and checked.
- The table existence check makes use of `split('\n')` to ensure correct comparison.
