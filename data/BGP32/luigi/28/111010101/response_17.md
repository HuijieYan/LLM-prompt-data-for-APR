### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` makes a call to `run_hive_cmd`, passing different queries based on the presence of the `partition` parameter.
2. The failing test case is checking for table existence in Hive. The first test case expects to return False if the table is not found, and True if found. The second test case is similar but involves case sensitivity. 
3. The buggy function fails to return the correct value because the condition checks are not consistent. The logic for checking the table existence is flawed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional check when `run_hive_cmd` is called and properly handle the table existence check based on the output.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return table in stdout.split('\n') if stdout else False
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newlines `split('\n')`, we create a list of table names. Then, we check if the provided table name is in that list. This correction ensures that the function behaves correctly when checking for table existence with or without partitions.
