### Error Analysis
The error is occurring because the `table_exists` function is not correctly checking for the existence of a table in the `stdout` output returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug lies in the comparison logic in the `if` conditions for checking the presence of the table.

The issue arises due to the incorrect comparison operators used. The buggy function checks for the existence of the table in the `stdout` by simply evaluating `stdout` as a truthy value instead of checking if the actual table name is present in the `stdout`. This results in failing test cases where the table exists but is not correctly identified.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in both parts of the `if` conditions. We should specifically check if the table name is present in the `stdout` string to determine if the table actually exists.

### Bug-fix code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
    
        return any(partition in line for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

By updating the `table_exists` function with the above code, the function correctly checks for the existence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This modification ensures the function returns the correct boolean value as expected in the failing test cases.
