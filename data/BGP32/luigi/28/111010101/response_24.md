### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check the output. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` after running the Hive commands.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case, the first call to `table_exists` with table name `'mytable'` and database `'default'` expects the `stdout` to be `'OK'`. However, the function incorrectly checks if the table name is in the `stdout`, which is causing the test to fail.
   
2. In the second failing test case, the call to `table_exists` with table name `'MyTable'` and database `'default'` expects the `stdout` to be `'OK\nmytable'`. This time the function is expecting the table name to be present in `stdout` after running Hive commands, and the incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` string is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly parses the `stdout` returned by the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. Modify the comparison logic to properly validate the existence of the table in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function correctly splits the `stdout` by newline characters and checks if the table name is in the resulting list of tables in the database. This change ensures that the function behaves as expected in the test cases provided.
