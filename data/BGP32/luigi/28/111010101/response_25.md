### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands, which returns the stdout of the command.
3. The bug occurs because the function is checking the presence of the table name in the stdout without handling the newline character that separates the tables in the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to consider the newline character when checking for the presence of the table name in the stdout.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the conditional check to handle the newline character in the stdout while checking for the table name.
2. Update the buggy function to split the stdout based on newline character and then check for the table name in each line separately.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` based on the newline character and then check if the table name exists in any line of the split output. This change ensures that each table name is checked individually, fixing the bug where the newline character was causing the function to return incorrect results.
