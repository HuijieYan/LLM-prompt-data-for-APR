### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi` package and depends on the `run_hive_cmd` function defined outside the class.
2. The function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a database using `hive` commands.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function is interpreting the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The `table_exists` function performs a check on whether the table name is in the stdout output, but the comparison logic is flawed.
4. Potential strategy to fix the bug:
   - Modify the comparison logic to properly check if the table name exists in the stdout output instead of a direct boolean comparison with stdout.
   - Ensure that the correct values are being returned for both cases (with partition and without partition) based on the stdout output.
   
### Revised Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return table in stdout
``` 

By properly checking if the table name exists in the `stdout` output for both cases with and without partitions, the corrected function is expected to pass all the test cases outlined.
