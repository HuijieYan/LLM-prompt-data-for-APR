### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in the given database. When the `partition` parameter is provided, it should also check for the existence of that specific partition.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function constructs the `stdout` variable when checking for the existence of a partition. It is not correctly formatted to parse the output.
3. The failing tests indicate that the provided output is not as expected, leading to incorrect evaluation of the existence of the table.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly format the `stdout` variable when querying partitions. We need to ensure that the output matches the expected format for comparison.

### Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ','.join(['{}="{}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})'.format(database, table, partition_str))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `stdout` variable is correctly formatted when checking for the existence of a partition. The `partition_str` variable constructs the partition string in the expected format for the query.
