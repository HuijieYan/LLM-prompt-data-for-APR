### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function from the same file to execute hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be in the conditional statement for checking if the table exists based on the `stdout` output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
3. The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle the case where the table name is a substring of another table name, causing incorrect evaluation of the existence of the table.
4. We need to modify the conditional statement so that it ensures an exact match of the table name in the list of tables obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the conditional statement to check for an exact match of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. This can be achieved by splitting the output by newline characters and checking if the table name is present in the list of tables. Additionally, we should ensure the comparison is case insensitive.

### Bug-free Function
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in tables)
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

The modification introduced splits the stdout by newline characters and checks for case-insensitive exact matching of the table name. This should ensure the correct evaluation of table existence based on the output of the hive command.
