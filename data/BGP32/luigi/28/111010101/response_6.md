### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks whether a table exists in a database by running a hive command. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute the command.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not correctly identifying the existence of tables, leading to assertion errors.
3. The bug seems to be caused by the logic in the function that checks the output of the hive command. The function is not handling the case where the table name is included in the stdout correctly, resulting in incorrect boolean evaluation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function checks the stdout to accurately determine if the table exists or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Since the function should return True if the table is found in the stdout, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle this condition. We will split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any of the lines extracted from the stdout.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking if the table name is present in any of these lines, the corrected function should now accurately identify whether the table exists in the database. This adjustment should address the failing test cases and ensure that the function operates as expected.
