### Analysis
1. The function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. It does so by executing Hive commands and parsing the output.
2. The function has two code paths: one for checking tables without partitions and one for checking partitions within a table.
3. The error message indicates that the function is failing to correctly identify if a table exists. The output is incorrect in both cases.
4. The bug is likely located in how the function is parsing the `stdout` variable to determine if the table exists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses the output of the Hive commands and returns the appropriate boolean value.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Modify the function to correctly parse the `stdout` variable from the Hive command output.
2. Ensure that the function handles both cases of table existence checking correctly.
3. Update the return statements to return the correct boolean value based on the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()  # Correctly check if table in the list of tables
    
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, otherwise False
```

By splitting the `stdout` and checking if the table exists in the list of tables, and updating the return statements to return `True` or `False` based on the output, this corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
