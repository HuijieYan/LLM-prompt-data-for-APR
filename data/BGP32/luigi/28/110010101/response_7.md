### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is intended to check if a table exists in a specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands.
2. The function has an if-else structure to handle the case where a partition is provided.
3. The error occurs in the case where no partition is provided. The function checks if the table name is in the stdout to determine if the table exists. However, the condition for returning `True` is incorrect.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect condition for returning `True` when the table exists. The function checks if `stdout` is not empty and then if the `table` is in `stdout`, but the expected check should be for the presence of the exact table name in the output.
5. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for returning `True` in the case where no partition is provided to correctly check if the exact table name is present in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The bug fix involves changing the condition `table in stdout` to `table in stdout.split()`. This change splits the `stdout` into a list of table names, making sure the exact table name matches the output before returning `True`.
