### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function checks whether a table exists in a given database and, optionally, a partition.
2. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries.
3. The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of the `stdout` variable and the condition for checking the existence of the table.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `stdout` variable contains the expected output from running the Hive command, and the condition for checking table existence is correctly implemented.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the inconsistent handling of the returned output from running the Hive command and the condition for checking table existence. In the current implementation:
- If no partition is provided, the function checks if the table name is in the `stdout`.
- If a partition is provided, the function simply checks if `stdout` is not empty.
These conditions are not aligned with the expected behavior of checking table existence based on the returned output from the Hive command.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the condition for checking table existence to properly utilize the `stdout` variable.
2. Ensure that the logic correctly identifies table existence based on the Hive command output.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1}
                        """.format(database, table))
            return stdout != ''

# Ensure 'run_hive_cmd' is properly imported and used in the corrected code.
# Potential import statement: from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function aligns the conditional checks with the expected behavior of checking table existence based on the output of the Hive command. This version should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
