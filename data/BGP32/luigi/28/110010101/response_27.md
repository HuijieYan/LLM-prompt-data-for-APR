### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it is not handling the expected return values correctly. In the failing cases, the function is expecting the presence of the table name in the output generated by a Hive command.

### Cause of the Bug
1. For the first failing case, the function is not correctly handling the case when the table name is not present in the output.
2. For the second failing case, the function is not correctly handling the case when there is a new-line character between the Hive command output and the table name.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, I will update the function to correctly check for the presence of the table name in the output. The output is fetched by running a Hive command, so the function should appropriately handle the different possible outputs.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return table in stdout.strip()  # check for presence of table name in output
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the different cases such as the absence of the table name in the output and additional characters like new-line characters. It compares the trimmed stdout with the expected table name for checking the table existence.
