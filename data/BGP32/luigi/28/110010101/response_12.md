### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in the specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to query Hive for table information.
2. The buggy function has two branches based on the presence of a `partition` argument. In case of a partition, it uses a different query than when there is no partition.
3. The bug appears to be related to how the function processes the returned output from the `run_hive_cmd` call. The conditional checks on the `stdout` variable are causing incorrect results in certain cases.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying how the function handles the `stdout` variable and the conditional checks.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Update the conditional checks to ensure proper handling of the returned output from the `run_hive_cmd` call.
2. Implement a suitable check to verify if the table exists in the output received from the Hive query.
3. Adjust the return statements accordingly to return the correct boolean value based on whether the table exists or not.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables like '{1}' partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case with no partition, the function queries Hive using `show tables like` and checks if the specified table exists in the output.
- For the case with a partition, the function constructs the query with proper formatting and checks if the specified table exists in the output.
- The return statements now correctly return boolean values after verifying the existence of the table in the output received from the Hive query.
