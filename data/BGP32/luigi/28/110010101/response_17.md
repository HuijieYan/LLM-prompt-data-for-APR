### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specific database or partition using Hive commands.
2. There are two potential error locations:
    - The way the function is checking for the existence of a table is not accurate, leading to incorrect return values.
    - The use of formatting and quotation marks in the Hive commands might introduce errors.
3. The cause of the bug stems from how the function processes the stdout from the Hive commands. The function expects to find the table's name directly in the stdout, but due to the formatting of the Hive commands, the string might contain other unwanted information. This discrepancy results in incorrect return values.
4. To fix the bug, a more precise approach to extract the table names from the stdout is needed. Additionally, validating the stdout more rigorously can help ensure that only the relevant information is considered.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1}'.format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return table in table_list
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show tables in {1}".format(database, table))
        table_list = stdout.strip().split('\n')
        return partition in table_list
```

In this corrected version:
- The Hive command has been modified to accurately list the tables in a database.
- The stdout from the Hive command is split into a list of table names, allowing for a more precise check.
- The function now checks if the table name is in the list of tables returned by the Hive command.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined.
