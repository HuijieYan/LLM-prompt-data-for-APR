### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. However, there are issues with how it handles the input parameters and executes the corresponding Hive commands. The function incorrectly checks for the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive command and returns `True` only if the command output is not empty.

### Bugs in the Function
1. The function does not handle case sensitivity. It should be case insensitive when checking for table existence.
2. In the case of a non-empty output from the Hive command, it erroneously assumes that the table exists, regardless of the contents of the output.

### Fixing the Bugs
1. To fix the case sensitivity issue, we can convert both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparing them.
2. Instead of just checking for a non-empty stdout, we should check if the table name is present in the stdout to ensure accurate table existence verification.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                      (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
```

By converting both the table name and the command output to lowercase before comparison, the function will now accurately check for the existence of the table in a case-insensitive manner.
