### Analysis
1. The function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve results.
3. The bug is causing incorrect evaluation of the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect return values.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `stdout` variable in the `if` conditions.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `stdout` output from `run_hive_cmd` for both cases when a partition is specified and when it is not.

### Bug Cause
- In the buggy function, the `stdout` variable is being checked to determine the presence of the table. 
- However, when a table does exist, the `stdout` might contain more information than just the table name.
- This causes issues in the comparison logic leading to incorrect return values.
- The bug lies in how the function interprets the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Proposed Fix
1. Update the function to parse the `stdout` output correctly to extract the relevant information (table name).
2. For the case where a partition is specified, ensure the correct partition information is included in the query.
3. Modify the comparison logic to check if the actual table name is present in the output.
4. Ensure that the function returns `True` only if the table is found in the output, else return `False`.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_str});')
            return table in stdout
```

By making these adjustments to properly extract and compare the table information from the `stdout` output, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected results.
