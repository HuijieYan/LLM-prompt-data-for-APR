### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a Hive database by executing specific commands using the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The function has two branches based on whether `partition` is provided or not.
3. The bug seems to be related to the response handling of executing the Hive commands and the comparison of the table name in the output.
4. The function is currently returning `True` only if there is some output after the Hive command execution, leading to incorrect behavior when checking table existence.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to return `True` whenever there is any output after executing the Hive command, regardless of whether the table name is present in that output or not. This behavior leads to failing tests where the table name is not found in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional logic in the `table_exists` function to properly check if the table name exists in the output or not.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected function:
- We split the `stdout` by newline character before checking if the `table` is in the output to accurately determine if the table exists.
- We also modify the condition in the `else` branch to return `True` only if there is some output after executing the command, removing unnecessary checks for the table name.

By applying these changes, the function should now correctly identify if a table exists in the Hive database.
