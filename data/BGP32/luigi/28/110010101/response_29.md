### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a given table exists in a database or in a partition of the table. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to run Hive commands and check the output. The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function and determines if the table exists or not.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition to check if `stdout` has a truthy value.
2. The treatment of the output when a partition is specified.

### Explanation of Bug
The bug lies in the way the function is checking the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the first condition, the function checks if `stdout` is truthy to determine if the table is in the database. However, it does not handle the case when `stdout` has additional content after the table name, leading to false negatives. In the second condition, when a partition is specified, the function is not correctly parsing the partition information from `stdout`, leading to incorrect return values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly interprets the output from `run_hive_cmd` in both cases. We need to properly extract the table names and partition information if present and then perform the check accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
            return bool(partitions)  # Check if partitions exist

```

This corrected version of the function parses the `stdout` to extract table names in one case and partition information in the other case. It then performs the necessary checks to ensure that the correct boolean value is returned based on the existence of the table or partitions.
