### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database. The function utilizes `run_hive_cmd` to query the Hive database using HiveQL queries.

### Error Location
The bug in the function lies in how it handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. When checking if a table exists, the function checks if the table name is present in the output. However, the check is not done correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the first case, when the output from Hive is `'OK'`, the function returns `True` only if the `stdout` value is not empty and contains the `table` name. However, in this case, the `table` name is not part of the output, resulting in the function incorrectly returning `False`.

2. In the second case, when the output from Hive includes the `table` name, the function should return `True`. However, due to the incorrect handling of the output, the function also fails to recognize the presence of the `table` name in the `stdout`, leading to the function returning `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly extract the table names from the `stdout` and compare them to the provided `table` name for table existence checks. Additionally, the check needs to be case-insensitive to match the test expectations.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables = stdout.strip().split('\n')
            return any(table.lower() == t.lower() for t in tables)

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            partitions = stdout.strip().split('\n')
            return any(self.partition_spec(partition) in p for p in partitions)
```

This corrected version of the `table_exists` function properly splits the output from Hive into individual table names or partitions. It then performs a case-insensitive check to determine the existence of the specified table name or partition. This modification ensures that the function returns the correct results according to the provided test cases.
