### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, the implementation does not handle the case sensitivity correctly, leading to failing tests.

1. The function contains two branches, one for when `partition` is `None` and another for when it is not. In both cases, it runs a hive command to check for table existence.
2. The bug occurs due to case sensitivity issues when checking the table name in the output of the hive command. The function checks if the table name is in the command output without case normalization, leading to inconsistencies.
3. The failing tests show the expected behavior for case sensitivity. The buggy function does not handle this properly, resulting in the returned values being incorrect for the test cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to normalize the case of the table names before checking for existence.

### Bug Fix
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By normalizing both the table name and the command output to lowercase, the bug related to case sensitivity in table name checking is addressed. This fix should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
