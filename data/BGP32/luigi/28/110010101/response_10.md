### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output to determine the existence of the table.
3. The bug seems to occur in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. The function is checking if the table name is present in the entire output string, which can lead to false positives (e.g., if the table name is a substring of another table's name).
4. To fix the bug, we should split the output by lines and check if the table name exists on a separate line to ensure an exact match.
5. We need to modify the function to split the output by lines before checking the table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the function to split the `stdout` using `stdout.split('\n')` before checking for the existence of the table.
- Update the return statements to check if the table name exists specifically on its own line to avoid false positives.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
```

With this correction, the function now splits the `stdout` by lines and checks if the table name exists on a separate line, ensuring an exact match. This change should address the false positives that were occurring in the buggy function.
