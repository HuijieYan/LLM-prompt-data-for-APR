### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class which is a subclass of `HiveClient`.
2. The function checks if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the return value is checked against the expected result. The function returns `True` only if `stdout` is not empty, which is incorrect. It should return `True` when the table exists in the database and `False` otherwise.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for returning `True`. We should return `True` if the table name is found in the output of the Hive command execution.
5. We should also remove unnecessary `if-else` conditions.

### Bug Fix
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout  # Return True if table is found in stdout, False otherwise
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout  # Return True if table is found in stdout, False otherwise
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly return `True` if the table exists in the database and `False` otherwise. This should address the failing test cases.
