### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and checks the output to determine if the table exists.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function and compares it against the expected table name.
4. The current implementation may not be handling the stdout processing and comparison correctly, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely stems from how the function is checking for the existence of a table based on the stdout received from `run_hive_cmd`. If the table name is present in the output, the function should return `True`, otherwise `False`. The bug seems to be in how the function processes the stdout and determines the presence of the table.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly parses and checks the output from `run_hive_cmd` to determine the existence of the table. We should make sure the comparison between the expected table name and the stdout is done accurately.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return table in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use `strip()` on the stdout to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces before comparing it to the table name.
2. For the case when a partition is specified, we directly check if the table name exists in the stdout received from the command execution.

These changes should help in accurately determining the existence of the table and fixing the bug.
