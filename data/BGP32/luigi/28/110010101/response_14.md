### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database using Hive commands.
2. The function has two branches - one for when `partition` is `None` and another for when it is provided.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `stdout` variable and checks for the existence of the table.
4. The function is currently returning a boolean based on whether the `stdout` contains the table name, but it should be checking the table name case-insensitively.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name in `stdout` directly instead of performing a case-insensitive check. This causes the function to fail under certain conditions, specifically when dealing with case-insensitive table names.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name with the `stdout`.
2. Normalize the table name and `stdout` before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and any(name.lower() == table.lower() for name in stdout.split())

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With these modifications, the function now performs a case-insensitive check to determine if the table exists in the given `stdout`. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided earlier.
