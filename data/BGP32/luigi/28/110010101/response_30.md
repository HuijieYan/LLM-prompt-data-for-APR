### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a hive command and returns `True` if the table exists, `False` otherwise.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the table name in the stdout output.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the stdout output, causing the comparison to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we properly parse the stdout output to check for the existence of the table.

### Correction
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)  # return True if stdout is not empty
```

By modifying the code to split the stdout by whitespace and check if the table is in the list of tables, we can correctly identify the existence of the table in the database. Additionally, for the partitioned case, we convert the stdout into a boolean directly to determine if it is empty or not.
