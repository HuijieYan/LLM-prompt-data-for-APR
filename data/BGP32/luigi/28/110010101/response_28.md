### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The bug seems to be related to the comparison check for the presence of the table in the `stdout` data. There might be issues with how the `stdout` data is being processed.
2. It seems like the check `return stdout and table in stdout` in the `table_exists` function may not be handling the case where `table` is present in `stdout` correctly.
3. Given the failing tests, it is evident that the function is not returning the expected values based on the provided `stdout` data in some cases. The function should return `True` if the table exists in the `stdout`.
4. Updating the return statements in the function based on whether the table is found in the `stdout` will likely address the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return True if stdout else False
```

By updating the return statements based on whether the table is found in the `stdout`, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
