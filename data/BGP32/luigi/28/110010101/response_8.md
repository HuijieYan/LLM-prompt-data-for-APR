### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a database using Hive commands. 
2. The function has a conditional statement to handle the case where a partition is provided.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output (`stdout`) from the Hive commands. In some cases, it checks if a string is present in the `stdout` instead of a more robust validation approach.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the `stdout` output from the Hive commands and accurately determines if the table or partition exists.

### Bug
The bug in the original function `table_exists` arises from how it checks the `stdout` for the presence of the table name. In the first case, it checks if the table name is directly in the `stdout` string, which can lead to false positives (e.g., if the table name is a substring of another table name shown in the output). The second case of checking partition existence is also not handled correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. For checking table existence without partition specification, we should split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the table name is in one of the lines.
2. For checking partition existence, we need to validate the `stdout` output comprehensively against the expected partition specification.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(table == t.strip() for t in stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(self.partition_spec(partition) in p for p in stdout.splitlines())
```

By splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and properly checking if the table or partition exists within the output lines, the corrected version of the function should now pass all the expected test cases.
