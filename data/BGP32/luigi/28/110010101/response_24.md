### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks if the expected table is present in the output.

The bug seems to be related to how the output (`stdout`) from the `run_hive_cmd` function is processed. The function expects the output to contain the table name in a specific format and checks for its presence within the entire output.

The test cases involve different scenarios of table existence checks, with and without partitions, along with cases testing for case insensitivity in table names. The bug is causing incorrect evaluation of the presence of tables in the output, leading to failing assertions.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the condition to check if a table exists in the returned output is not correctly handled. The function checks if the whole table name exists in the output rather than parsing the output to find the exact table names. This approach leads to faulty evaluations in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to parse the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function to extract table names correctly. We can split the output into lines and then check each line to find if the expected table name exists.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

This corrected version properly splits the output into lines and iterates over each line to check for the presence of the expected table. This approach ensures accurate table existence checks and should pass the failing test cases.
