### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class.
2. The function takes in parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`.
3. The function checks if a table exists in a database using different commands based on whether a partition is specified or not.
4. The buggy function is failing the tests as it returns `False` when it should return `True` in certain cases.

### Error
The bug in the function is that it checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering the case sensitivity. The expected table name might not match the case in the output, leading to the incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` strings to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the comparison for table existence is case-insensitive. This fix will address the failing test cases.
