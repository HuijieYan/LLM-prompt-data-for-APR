### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to how the function checks for the existence of a table in the database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. In the first branch of the `if` statement where `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the `table` is in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`. In the second branch, when `partition` is not `None`, the function constructs a more complex Hive command to check for table existence with the specified partition.

The bug seems to be related to how the function parses the output from `run_hive_cmd` to determine if the table exists or not. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly identifying the table existence in the given output, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in how the function is checking the presence of the table in the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd`. The function is not handling the output properly, causing it to return incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not effectively parsing and processing the stdout from the Hive commands executed via `run_hive_cmd`. This results in incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the stdout returned by `run_hive_cmd` and accurately determines if the table exists based on that output. Additionally, we should handle different cases such as case insensitivity when checking for table existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split("\n")
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout.strip() == ""  # Table exists if partitions are returned
```

In the corrected version:
- For the case where `partition` is `None`, the function now converts both the table name and the lines in `stdout` to lowercase to perform a case-insensitive comparison and check if the table exists.
- For the case where `partition` is not `None`, the function checks if any partitions are returned in the `stdout` to determine if the table exists in that partition. 

These adjustments should address the issue with the buggy function not correctly identifying the table existence and ensure the tests pass successfully.
