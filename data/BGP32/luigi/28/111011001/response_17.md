### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases due to incorrect handling of the standard output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command. However, the comparison of the table name with the stdout is leading to incorrect results.

### Bug
The bug lies in the comparison logic inside the `table_exists` function. When checking for table existence in the `stdout`, it should search for an exact match of the table name rather than checking if the table name is contained in the `stdout`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check for an exact match of the table name in the `stdout`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the `table in stdout` comparison is replaced with `table in stdout.split('\n')` to check for an exact match of the table name in the output. This change ensures that the function correctly determines the existence of a table in the database.
