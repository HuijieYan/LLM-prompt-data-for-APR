### Analysis:
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a specified database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
- The bug seems to be in the logic of parsing the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd`.
- In the failing tests, the function checks if the table name is in the stdout response to determine table existence.
- The bug causes the function to return incorrect values based on the stdout response.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the conditional checks to determine if the table exists. The function checks for the presence of the table name in the stdout, but the parsing is incorrect, leading to the incorrect determination of table existence.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly parse and check the stdout response to determine table existence.
2. Make sure the function handles different cases like case sensitivity and formatting of the stdout response.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split('\n')
```

With this corrected version, the function splits the stdout response by '\n' and then checks if the table name is present in any of the lines. This should correctly determine the existence of the table based on the stdout response. This updated logic should pass the failing tests.
