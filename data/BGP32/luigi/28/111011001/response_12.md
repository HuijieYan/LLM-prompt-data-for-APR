### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. However, the bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable.

1. In the first case, the function incorrectly expects `stdout` to contain only the table name, but it actually contains more text. This leads to the incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists in the stdout.

2. In the second case, a similar issue exists where `stdout` contains more text than just the table name, causing the function to return the wrong result.

3. In the third case, although the `stdout` contains only the table name, the function fails to correctly compare the table name due to the format of the comparison.

4. In the fourth case, the same issue arises where the table name is not correctly extracted from `stdout` for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the comparison of the table name in the `stdout` variable. We should extract the table names from the `stdout` variable correctly and then perform the comparison. Additionally, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive to match the behavior in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
```

By converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase and splitting the `stdout` to handle multiple table names, we ensure a correct comparison and address the bug.
