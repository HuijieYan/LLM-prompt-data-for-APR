### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function checks if a given table exists in a database by running a Hive command using the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of the table in the output received from the `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The issue arises from the comparison of the table name within the stdout received. The function checks if the entire table name is present in the stdout, which causes a mismatch when the table name is part of a string containing other information as well.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to accurately detect the table's existence.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` by spaces after the `run_hive_cmd` call, we are able to detect if the table name exists in the output correctly, avoiding issues like having the table name as part of a longer string causing false positives.
