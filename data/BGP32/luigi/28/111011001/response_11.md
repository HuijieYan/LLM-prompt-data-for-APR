### Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This causes the function to fail when checking for tables with varying case.

- In Case 1, the function returns `False` even though the table exists in the output due to case sensitivity.
- In Case 2, the function fails to detect the table with different casing, resulting in the assertion error.
- In Case 3 and Case 4, similar issues occur due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of table names to be case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before checking for existence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison, fixing the bug present in the original function.
