### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to how the function checks if a table exists in the Hive database. The issue arises because the function checks for the presence of the table name in the 'stdout' output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the current implementation does not handle cases where the table name might be a substring of another table name present in the 'stdout' output.

In the failing test cases provided, the function incorrectly returns `True` when the 'stdout' output contains a table name that is a substring of the actual table name being checked. This leads to false positives in the test assertions, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the condition for checking the existence of the table in the 'stdout' output. Instead of a simple substring check, we should ensure that the table name is matched as a whole word in the 'stdout' output to avoid false positives.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug described above:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(tbl.strip() == table for tbl in stdout.split("\n"))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout is not empty, False otherwise
```

By splitting the 'stdout' output by newlines and checking each table name individually against the desired table, we ensure that the function only returns `True` when an exact match is found. This modification should address the false positives and fix the failing test cases.
