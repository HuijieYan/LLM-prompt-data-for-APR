### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `table` name in the returned output from `run_hive_cmd` with the `table` name passed as an argument. The bug occurs because the comparison is case-sensitive, causing mismatches when the case of the table names differs.

In the failing test cases, the test `test_apacheclient_table_exists` illustrates this issue. When the `table` name is passed as `'mytable'`, and the returned output contains `'mytable'`, the comparison fails because the function expects an exact match due to case sensitivity.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison between the `table` name and the tables found in the output should be made case-insensitive. This change will ensure that the function can correctly identify the table's existence regardless of the case of the table names.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version introduces a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the `table` name and the tables found in the output to lowercase before the comparison. This ensures that the function can correctly identify the existence of the table regardless of the case of the table names.
