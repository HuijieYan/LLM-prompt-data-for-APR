The bug in the `table_exists` function seems to be related to how the function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue arises from how the function handles the case where the table name is not found in the output of a Hive command. 

The buggy function checks if the `stdout` variable is truthy (`stdout`) and then checks if `table` is in `stdout`. This logic is flawed because even if `stdout` is not empty, the presence of the table name may be at a different index than expected. This leads to incorrect results and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how we check for the table's existence. We should check if the table name is in `stdout` regardless of the position or formatting of the output.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show tables in {1} like '{2}';""".format(database, table, table))
        return table in stdout
```

In this corrected version, we utilize the `show tables in database_name like 'table_name'` syntax to specifically look for a table in a given database. This ensures that regardless of the format of the output from the Hive command, we correctly identify the existence of the table.

After applying this correction, the function should return the correct results and pass the failing tests.
