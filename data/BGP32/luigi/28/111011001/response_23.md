### Bug Analysis:
The bug is related to the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. The function is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database either without partitions or with specific partitions. The issue seems to be with how the function compares the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists.

1. In Case 1, the stdout value is 'OK' which doesn't contain the table name 'mytable', but the function incorrectly returns `True`.
2. In Case 2, the stdout value is 'OK\nmytable' which contains the table name 'mytable', but the function incorrectly returns `False`.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison logic used to check if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. Instead of checking if the table name is present in the entire stdout string, we should split the stdout by newline characters and then check if the table name exists in any line of the output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and (table in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the comparison logic now ensures that the table name is checked properly within each line of the stdout, fixing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
