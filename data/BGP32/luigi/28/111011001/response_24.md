### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison of the `table` name in the `stdout`. The function checks if the `table` name is in the `stdout` output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the failing tests, the comparison is failing because the `table` name is case-sensitive, causing the function to incorrectly return `False`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because when comparing the `table` name in the `stdout`, the function does a direct string match, which is case-sensitive. This causes the function to return `False` even when the `table` exists but with a different case. 

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the `table` and the lines in `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By converting both the `table` name and the lines in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will now correctly identify the table existence without being case-sensitive.
