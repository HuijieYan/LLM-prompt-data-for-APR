### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a Hive database by running a Hive command. The issue seems to be with how the function is checking the existence of the table based on the output of the Hive command. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and then checks if the table is present in the output of the command.

In the failing test cases, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the presence of the table in the stdout output from the Hive command.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the current implementation lies in how the function is checking for the table's existence. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` expects the table name to be exactly as it appears in the stdout, which might not always be the case.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of how the function checks for the table existence in the stdout output. We can modify the check to be case-insensitive and handle variations in the output format.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output and checking each table name case-insensitively, we can accurately determine the existence of the table in the Hive database.
