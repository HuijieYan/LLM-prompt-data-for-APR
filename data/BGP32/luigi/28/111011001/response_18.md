### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the method of checking for the existence of a table in the Hive database. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not. However, the current implementation is flawed in handling the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

In the first part of the function, when no partition is specified, it tries to show tables like the given table name in the specified database. It then checks if the table name is in the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This part seems correct.

The bug resides in the second part where a table with a specified partition is being checked. The function constructs a Hive command to show the partitions for the given table and partition, and then tries to determine the existence of the partition. The issue arises in the comparison of the stdout with an empty string to determine whether the partition exists. This comparison is incorrect as an empty string should indicate that the table or partition does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional checks for whether the table or partition exists based on the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We should check for the presence of the table or partition in the output, rather than just the truthiness of the output string.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
# Assuming run_hive_cmd is imported correctly in the file

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout is not None
``` 

By modifying the conditions for checking the presence of a table or partition in stdout, the function should now correctly determine the existence of the specified table or partition in the Hive database.
