### Analysis
- The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database in Hive.
- The function calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands.
- In the failing test cases, the function is returning incorrect results, leading to assertion errors.
- The function checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the table name is found in the output, it returns `True`, indicating that the table exists; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function is processing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case where the table name is part of a longer string in the `stdout` variable. This leads to incorrect detection of table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable to ensure it correctly identifies the table name. Additionally, we should consider handling case sensitivity concerns when comparing table names.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(line.strip().lower() == table.lower() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` variable by newline characters and compare each line, converted to lowercase, with the table name provided. This allows us to accurately detect if the table name exists within the output.
- We handle case sensitivity by converting both the table name and the lines in `stdout` to lowercase for comparison.
- We directly return `bool(stdout)` to simplify the logic of the function.
