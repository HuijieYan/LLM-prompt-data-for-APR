### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given database and partition. However, there are issues with the conditional blocks and the usage of the variables within the function. 

### Bugs:
1. In the first conditional block, the function incorrectly checks if `stdout` is truthy and then if `table` is in `stdout`. This logic will not work as expected.
2. In the second conditional block, the function incorrectly constructs the command to check for partitions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the logic in the first conditional block to check if `table` is in `stdout`.
2. Correctly construct the command to check for partitions in the second conditional block.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version of the function incorporates the bug fixes and should now correctly check for the existence of a table in a database and partition.
