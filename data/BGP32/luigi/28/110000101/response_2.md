### Bug explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to the incorrect way of checking the presence of a table or partition in the Hive database. In the first condition, when `partition` is `None`, the function runs a Hive command to check if the table exists by using the `show tables like` command. However, the function incorrectly checks if the `table` is in the output string. This can lead to false positives or negatives depending on the exact match of the table name.

In the second condition, when `partition` is not `None`, the function runs a command to show partitions of a table. The bug occurs because it only checks if the `stdout` is not empty to return `True`, which may not always correspond to the actual existence of the table/partition.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the way we check for the existence of tables/partitions in the Hive database. We can improve the function by explicitly checking the output of the Hive commands for the presence of the table/partition.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split("\n")  # Check if the table is in the list of tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show {1} partitions {2} partition ({3});""".format(database, table, 'partitions' if len(partition) > 0 else '', self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout.strip())  # Check if the output is non-empty to confirm partition existence
``` 

By explicitly checking if the `table` exists in the list of tables or if the `stdout` is non-empty for partitions, the corrected function will provide more accurate results in checking for the existence of tables and partitions in the Hive database.
