### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition where it checks the presence of the table or partition in the `stdout` variable. When checking if `stdout` is not empty using `stdout`, it returns `True` as long as `stdout` is not empty, regardless of the content. This means that even if `table` or partition is not in `stdout`, the function will incorrectly return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to specifically check if the table or partition exists in the output received from the Hive command. We can modify the condition to check if the table or partition names are present in the `stdout` output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout.split() if stdout else False
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly checks if the `table` or `partition` is present in the `stdout` output received from the Hive command. It splits the `stdout` string and checks if the `table` or `partition` name exists in the list of table names returned by the command.
