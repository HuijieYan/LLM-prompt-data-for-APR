### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional checks for whether the `stdout` variable contains the required information. In the first conditional block, `return stdout and table in stdout` will return True only if the `stdout` is not empty and the `table` is found in `stdout`. In the second conditional block, `if stdout` will return True only if `stdout` is not empty, but it doesn't check if the table exists or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the first conditional block to check if the table exists in the `stdout` instead of just checking if `stdout` is not empty.
2. Update the second conditional block to include a check if the table exists in the `stdout` as well.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout  # Check if table exists in stdout
```

By making these adjustments, the function will properly check whether the table exists in the stdout response from the Hive queries, fixing the bug based on the expected input/output values provided.
