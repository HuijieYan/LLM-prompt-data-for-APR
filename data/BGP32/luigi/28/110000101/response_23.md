### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table or partition exists in the specified database by running Hive queries. The bug seems to be related to how the `stdout` is being checked for truthiness to determine whether the table/partition exists. The function returns `True` if `stdout` contains the table/partition name and `False` otherwise.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `run_hive_cmd` function used to execute Hive commands and capture the output may not always return the exact string that needs to be checked. The current implementation only checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty, leading to incorrect evaluation.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to check if the table/partition name is actually present in the `stdout` variable rather than just checking if it's not empty. We can achieve this by explicitly searching for the table/partition name in the `stdout` variable.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and any(table_name.strip() == table for table_name in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(partition in part for part in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable and checking each individual line for the exact table/partition name, we can accurately determine if the table/partition exists based on the expected input/output values provided.
