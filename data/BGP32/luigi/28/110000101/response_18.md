### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table or partition exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries and check the output to determine if the table/partition exists. 

The bug in the function lies in how the output (`stdout`) from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked and returned. In the first condition, the function checks if `stdout` is not empty and if the `table` string is in `stdout` to determine if the table exists. In the second condition, it simply checks if `stdout` exists to determine if the partition exists.

The bug is caused by the absence of proper parsing and comparison between the expected output and the actual output. The function is not handling the output in a robust way to accurately determine if the table or partition exists based on the inquiry made.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic when checking the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. We need to ensure that the function accurately determines the existence of the table/partition by properly parsing the output and comparing it with the expected values.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.strip() == table
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});")
            return any(partition in part for part in stdout.strip().split('\n'))
```

This corrected version properly compares the `stdout` output with the expected table/partition information to accurately determine their existence. The function now checks if the expected table/partition is present in the formatted `stdout` output and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.
