## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a hive database. It takes three parameters: `table` (the name of the table), `database` (the name of the database, default is 'default'), and `partition` (optional dictionary specifying the partition details). The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute hive commands and check if the table exists or not.

The bug in the function lies in the condition check for the existence of the table. In the case where a partition is provided, the stdout response from the hive command is not correctly handled.

## Bug
When the `partition` argument is provided, the `stdout` response is checked with `if stdout`, which is only false if the string is empty. In the case when the partition exists but is not explicitly found, the stdout may not be empty (it contains partition details), leading to a wrong result from the function.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check when `partition` is provided. We should check if the table name is part of the `stdout` to determine the existence of the table. Additionally, we should also properly format the command to show partitions with correct placeholders.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected function for checking table existence
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly checks if the table exists both with and without partition details.
