### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table or partition exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieves the output which should contain the table name if it exists. There are two main issues in the function:
1. In the case of checking for a table's existence without partition, the check `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect. The function should check if the table is present in the stdout output irrespective of the value of `stdout`.
2. In the case of checking for a partitioned table's existence, the constructed Hive command querying for partitions seems incorrect and might not provide the desired output.

### Bug Explanation
1. In case the function is checking for a table's existence without a partition:
   - The bug occurs in the line `return stdout and table in stdout` because it mistakenly checks whether `stdout` is not empty and the `table` is present in `stdout`.
   - The issue here is that the condition `stdout and table in stdout` will return `True` even if `table` is not present in `stdout`, as long as `stdout` is not empty. This leads to incorrect results.

2. In case the function is checking for a partitioned table's existence:
   - The bug occurs in the line constructing the Hive command to show partitions, as it might not be retrieving the correct partitions given a specific partition spec.
   - There is also an issue with the formatting of the command string which may lead to inaccurate output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. For the table existence check without partition:
   - Correct the condition to directly check if the `table` is in the `stdout` output.

2. For the partitioned table existence check:
   - Ensure that the constructed command to show partitions is correct and retrieves the necessary information.
   - Improve the formatting of the Hive command string to accurately query for partitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout.strip() != ''
```
