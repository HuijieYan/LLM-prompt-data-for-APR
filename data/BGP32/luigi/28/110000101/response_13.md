### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking for the existence of a table in a given database in Hive. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the stdout value after running Hive commands. The function is expected to return `True` if the table exists, otherwise `False`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name in the if conditions. The function checks if the `stdout` contains the exact table name, which might not be the case because the `stdout` may contain additional information (like column names, new line characters, etc.). This incorrect comparison leads to inaccurate results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison conditions to correctly check if the table name exists in the `stdout` string. We should also ensure the comparison is case-insensitive because Hive is case-insensitive by default. Adjusting the comparison logic and appropriately handling the `stdout` string will help in accurately determining table existence.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower().split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return any(table.lower() in line.lower() for line in stdout.splitlines())
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function compares the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of each line in the `stdout` to ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. It splits the `stdout` string by lines before comparing in the partition case to handle multiple partitions correctly. This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected test cases provided.
