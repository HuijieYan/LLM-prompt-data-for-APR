### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a specified database. The function makes use of the `run_hive_cmd` function to interact with Hive. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the results from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Issues
1. In the case where `partition` is not provided, the function checks if the table is in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, the comparison is incorrect and might not work as intended.
2. In the case where `partition` is provided, the function constructs a query to check partitions, but the return logic seems to be incorrect. The function should return `True` if there are partitions found, not if the `stdout` object exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the comparison logic in the case where `partition` is not provided to check for an exact match in the stdout.
2. Update the return logic in the case where `partition` is provided to correctly return based on the presence of partitions.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.strip().split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())
```

In the corrected version:
1. In the case without a partition, the function checks if the table exists in each line of the `stdout` output after stripping the newline characters.
2. In the case with a partition, the function checks if there are any partitions returned in the `stdout` output after stripping any whitespace.
