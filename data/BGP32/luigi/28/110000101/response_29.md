### Analyzing the buggy function
The function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in the specified database with optional partition information. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute hive commands and check the output for the existence of the table.

### Potential error locations
1. The conditional check for `partition is None` may not be handling different cases correctly.
2. The construction of the hive command query might be incorrect.
3. The comparison of the stdout variable to determine if the table exists might be flawed.

### Cause of the bug
The bug might arise from incorrect formatting of the hive command query when specifying the partition, potentially leading to incorrect output evaluation. Additionally, the logic for checking whether the table exists or not based on the stdout variable is not robust.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the hive command query is constructed properly, especially when dealing with partitions.
2. Improve the logic for checking the stdout output to accurately determine if the table exists based on the provided input parameters.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return len(stdout.split('\n')) > 2
```

In the corrected version:
- The stdout check after running the hive command is improved by splitting the output into lines and checking if the table exists in those lines.
- The construction of the hive command query is adjusted to ensure proper formatting when dealing with partitions.
- The return value is based on whether the table was found in the stdout lines or based on the number of lines to determine partition existence.
