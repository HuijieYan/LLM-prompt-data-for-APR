### Analysis
The function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a given database. If a partition is provided, it also checks if that partition exists within the table. The bug seems to be related to how the stdout response is being handled in the function.

### Bug
The bug seems to be in the if-else structure of the function where the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` function is being checked. In the current implementation, the function returns `True` if stdout is not empty for both cases, which is incorrect.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should check if the table or partition actually exists in the stdout response and return `True` only if the table or partition is found.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return partition in stdout
```
