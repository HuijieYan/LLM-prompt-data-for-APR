### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a database. It has two branches based on the presence of a `partition` parameter. In the `else` branch, it tries to check if partitions exist for a given table. However, the condition for returning `True` or `False` is incorrect, leading to a bug.

### Bug Explanation
In the current implementation, the function always returns `True` in the `else` branch when checking for partitions, regardless of the actual existence of partitions. This is because the condition `if stdout:` checks if `stdout` is not empty which is always the case when using `run_hive_cmd`. This behavior does not accurately determine if partitions exist for the table.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `else` branch to accurately check if partitions exist. We should base the return value on whether the partition spec exists in the `stdout`, not just if `stdout` is non-empty. We can modify the return statement to check for the existence of the partition spec in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(self.partition_spec(partition) in part for part in stdout.splitlines())
``` 

In the corrected version, the return statement in the `else` branch now checks if any line in the `stdout` contains the partition spec using a list comprehension and the `any` function. This accurately determines if the partition spec exists and fixes the bug in the original implementation.
