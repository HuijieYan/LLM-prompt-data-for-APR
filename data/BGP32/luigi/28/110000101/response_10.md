### Analysis
The function `table_exists` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be in the logic of how the stdout is being checked. The function should return `True` if the table exists and `False` otherwise.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function, the logic for checking if a table exists is flawed. In the first part of the function (`if partition is None`), the function is checking if the table name is present in the stdout from the Hive command. However, the check `return stdout and table in stdout` is incorrect because as long as stdout is not an empty string, this condition would be true regardless of whether the table actually exists or not.

In the second part of the function (`else`), the function simply checks if stdout is not `None`, which does not necessarily mean that the table exists. It should be checking if the table name is present in the stdout to determine table existence.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic where we check if the table exists. We need to ensure that the function checks if the table name is present in the stdout from the Hive command. If the table name is found in the stdout, then the function should return `True`, indicating that the table exists. If the table name is not found, the function should return `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return table in stdout
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly checks if the table name is present in the stdout to determine if the table exists in the Hive database.
