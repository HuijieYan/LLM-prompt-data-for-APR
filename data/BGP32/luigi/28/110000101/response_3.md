### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table or partition in a Hive database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. 

The bug lies in the `else` block where it tries to check for partitions. The current implementation is incorrect for reading the output of `run_hive_cmd` when checking for partitions. The condition `if stdout:` will always return `True` as long as the command executed successfully, regardless of the actual result of the partition operation. This leads to incorrect behavior as the function will always return `True` for partitions, even if they don't exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of solely relying on the presence of non-empty `stdout` to determine success, we should specifically search for the partition information in the output.
2. Modify the condition in the `else` block to check if the partition information exists in the `stdout` before returning `True`.

### Updated/Copyedited Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                    ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return partition in stdout
```
