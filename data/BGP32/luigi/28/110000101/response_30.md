### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database. The main issue in the function is the condition to check the existence of a table with or without a partition. The current implementation doesn't handle the partition case correctly.

### Bug
The bug occurs when trying to check the existence of a table with a specific partition. The `run_hive_cmd` function is not properly constructed to handle this case, leading to incorrect results being returned.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Correct the formatting for running the Hive command with a specific partition.
2. Ensure that the function behaves correctly when checking for tables with partitions.

### Corrected Version

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            if isinstance(partition, dict):
                partition_str = ','.join(['{0}={1}'.format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            else:
                partition_str = partition

            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_str))

            return stdout and partition_str in stdout
```

In the corrected version:
- The `run_hive_cmd` function is called based on whether a partition exists or not.
- If a partition exists, the `partition` parameter is converted into a string format for querying the partition.
- The query to check for the existence of a specific partition is constructed correctly.
