### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` checks if a table exists in a database by running a `show tables` or `show partitions` command in Hive. The bug seems to be related to how the `stdout` variable is being checked for existence. It currently returns `True` if `stdout` has a value, regardless of the actual content. This might lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises in the `stdout` check for the existence of a table or partition. The current implementation only checks if `stdout` has a value, which may not accurately indicate the presence of the table or partition. For example, if the `stdout` contains unwanted spaces or other non-table names, the function might still return `True` incorrectly. This will lead to incorrect results being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify how we check the `stdout` variable. Instead of just checking for the existence of a value, we should explicitly check if the table or partition name is present in the output. This will ensure a more accurate determination of whether the table or partition exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return table in stdout.splitlines()
```

By splitting the `stdout` output into lines and explicitly checking if the `table` is present in those lines, we ensure a more accurate determination of table or partition existence.
