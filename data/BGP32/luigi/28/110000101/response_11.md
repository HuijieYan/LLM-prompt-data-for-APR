## Analyzing the buggy function:
The provided buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function checks if a table (and optionally a partition) exists in the specified Hive database using Hive commands.

## Error Location:
The bug in the function lies in the `table_exists` function logic where it checks the existence of the table. The main issue is with how the function processes the `stdout` from the `run_hive_cmd()` function.

## Cause of the bug:
1. In the first `if` block, the function checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, but it should check if the `table` is in `stdout.split()`.
   
2. In the `else` block, the function checks for the existence of the partitions based on `stdout`, which may lead to incorrect results if the list of partitions is not empty.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the first `if` block to check if `table` is in `stdout.split()`.
   
2. Modify the logic in the `else` block to check for a specific partition by iterating through the `stdout` to find a match.

## Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        if stdout:
            partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
            for line in stdout.split('\n'):
                if partition_str in line:
                    return True
        return False
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the output from Hive commands and give the expected results as specified.
