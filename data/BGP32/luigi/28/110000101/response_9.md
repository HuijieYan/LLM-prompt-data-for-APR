### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is checking whether a table exists in a database in a Hive setup. The bug seems to be mainly related to the logic of parsing the output from the Hive command.

### Identified Bug
The bug lies in the logic of checking the existence of a table based on the output of the Hive command. The function does not correctly handle the cases where the table names are included in the output with different formats or in multiple lines.

### Cause of the Bug
1. In the `stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))` case, the function is not properly parsing the output to check for the presence of the table name.

2. In the `else` case, when partitions are involved, the function is not correctly parsing and checking the presence of the table names and partitions in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. For the first case, where the table exists check is straightforward, we need to split the output by lines and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines.

2. For the second case, we need to ensure that we are correctly parsing the partitions and table names from the output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

In this corrected version:
- We split the `stdout` by lines using `stdout.split('\n')`.
- We check if the table name is present in any of the lines using a list comprehension and the `any` function.
- This approach ensures that we correctly handle cases where the table names are part of a multiline output or have different formats.
