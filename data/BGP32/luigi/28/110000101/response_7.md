### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check if a given table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute a Hive command and then checks the output to determine if the table exists. There are issues with the conditional checks and string formatting in the function that need to be addressed.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the case where `partition is None`, the function runs a Hive command to show tables and checks if the `table` exists in the output. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where the table name might be part of another table name, leading to potential false positives or negatives in the output.

2. In the case where `partition` is provided, the function constructs a Hive command incorrectly by including the partition specification without ensuring it is correctly formatted. This can result in errors when running the command or incorrect output comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the table name is properly isolated in the output when checking for table existence.
2. Correctly format the Hive command when partitions are involved to avoid errors and incorrect outputs.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        tables = stdout.split('\n')
        return table in tables
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        partitions = stdout.split('\n')
        return bool(partitions)
```

In the corrected function:
- When `partition is None`, we split the stdout by newlines and then check if the `table` appears as a separate item in the list.
- When `partition` is provided, we correctly format the Hive command and split the stdout by newlines to determine the existence of partitions. The return value is based on whether partitions were found or not.
