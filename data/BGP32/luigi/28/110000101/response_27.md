### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has two branches based on the presence of the `partition` parameter. In the first branch, it executes a Hive command to check if a table exists. In the second branch, it tries to check if a partition exists within a table. The bug might be related to the logic for checking the existence of a partition.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the second branch of the `table_exists` function where it tries to check if a partition exists within a table. The bug is caused by the comparison of the stdout variable without properly checking for the existence of the partition. The logic only checks if `stdout` exists, which can lead to incorrect results when the partition does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison check for the existence of the partition within the `table_exists` function. We should check if the partition is in the stdout variable and return True if it exists, and False if it doesn't.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return partition in stdout if stdout else False
``` 

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function properly checks for the existence of the partition in the stdout variable before returning the result.
