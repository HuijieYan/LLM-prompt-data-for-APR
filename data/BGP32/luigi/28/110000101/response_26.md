### Analysis
- The `table_exists` function checks if a table exists in the specified database. If a partition is provided, it checks if a specific partition exists for the table.
- The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands.
- There are two branches in the function: one for when `partition` is `None` and another for when `partition` is not `None`.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `stdout` variable and the conditional checks.

### Bug
- The bug occurs in the `else` branch where the function is not correctly returning the existence check result based on the `stdout`.
- In the second branch of the function, the condition `if stdout:` is always evaluating to `True` because the non-empty string `stdout` is always truthy, resulting in the function always returning `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Modify the `if stdout:` condition to properly check if the output contains the table name.
- Use the `in` keyword to check if the table name is present in the `stdout`.
- Ensure that the function returns `True` if the table/partition exists and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return table in stdout
```
