### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the way it checks for the existence of a table within a database when a partition is provided. When no partition is provided, it executes a command to show tables in the specified database and checks if the table exists in the output. However, when a partition is provided, it executes a different command to show partitions for the table and database combination. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the scenarios where the command output contains the table name.

### Bug Identification
In the given failing test cases, the issue arises when the table name provided exists within the same text block as other information in the command output. The current implementation of the function only checks if the table name is in the stdout without considering the context in which it appears, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should have a more robust way of parsing the command output to accurately determine if the specified table exists. The function should check if the table name appears as a standalone entry in the output to avoid false positives. This can be achieved by splitting the output based on newline characters and then checking for the presence of the table name within the list of strings generated. This approach ensures that the function accurately identifies the table existence based on the command output.

### Corrected Function
After understanding the bug and the required fix, here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                 (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
```

By splitting the stdout based on newline characters before checking for table existence, the corrected function ensures that the table name is treated as a separate entity in the command output, preventing false positives. This modification addresses the bug and ensures that the function functions correctly in all scenarios.
