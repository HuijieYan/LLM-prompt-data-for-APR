### Bug Explanation

The bug arises from how the function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in the Hive metastore. When checking for a table without partitions, the function forms a query using `run_hive_cmd` and checks if the table exists in the output. However, when checking for a table with partitions, it uses a different query by calling `self.partition_spec(partition)` to construct the partition specifications. This difference in querying logic results in incorrect return values for tables with partitions.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function consistently checks for table existence with or without partitions using the same logic. One approach is to combine the two cases into a single query construction process similar to the one for tables without partitions.

### Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        query = "use {0}; show tables like '{1}';".format(database, table)
        if partition:
            query = "use {0}; show partitions {1} partition {2}".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))

        stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
        return table in stdout if stdout else False
```

By consolidating the table existence checks into a single logic flow, the corrected version ensures consistent behavior for tables with or without partitions. This modification should address the bug and enable the function to pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
