### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from how the function checks for the table's existence based on the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. In the current implementation, the function checks if the table name is in the output string, which is causing issues with the test cases. The `stdout` variables being checked are not handling case sensitivity correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of a table regardless of the case of the input table name.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function


    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected function now checks for table existence in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. This modification ensures that the function behaves as expected based on the provided test cases.
