### Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the condition checking the presence of the table in the stdout. The buggy function is returning `True` only if stdout is not empty. However, in the failing test cases, the expected behavior includes checking if the table name is present in the stdout output.

Here's a summary of the issue:
- The function does not correctly validate if the table name is present in the `stdout` when checking for table existence.
- The current implementation only checks if `stdout` is not empty (truthy) to determine that the table exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to modify the condition that determines the existence of a table. Instead of just checking if `stdout` is not empty, we need to verify if the `table` name is present in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function uses the `table in stdout` condition to ensure that the table name is present in the `stdout` output, confirming the existence of the table. This modification should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in all test cases.
