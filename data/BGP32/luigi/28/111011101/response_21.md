### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing because it does not properly handle cases where the table name is case-insensitive. The function checks for the exact match of the table name in the stdout, causing it to fail in cases where there is a difference in the table name's case.

### Bug Explanation
- The buggy function invokes `run_hive_cmd` to get the output that contains table information.
- In the failing test cases, the `table_exists` function is called with a table name that might have a different case than what is returned by `run_hive_cmd`. This causes the function to expect an exact match in table names, leading to failures.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the `table_exists` function to handle case-insensitive comparison of table names. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the output string to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function should now handle case-insensitive table name comparisons correctly.
