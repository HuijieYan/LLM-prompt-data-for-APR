### Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in how the function checks for the existence of a table in the stdout output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table name as a substring in the stdout, which leads to incorrect results, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function compares whether the table name is in the `stdout` variable directly, which can lead to false positives (e.g., if the table name is a substring of another table name). This comparison is not sufficient to determine the exact existence of the table.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should parse the lines in the `stdout` variable and compare each line with the table name to ensure an exact match. This approach will avoid false positives and accurately determine if the table exists in the database.

### Correction
Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return table in stdout.split()
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable into lines and checking each line for the exact match with the table name, the corrected function will accurately determine the existence of the table, fixing the bug.
