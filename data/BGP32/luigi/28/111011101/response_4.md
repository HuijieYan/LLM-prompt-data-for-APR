### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check if a table or partition exists in a specified database.
2. In the failing test cases, the function is expected to return `True` if the table or partition exists based on the output from `run_hive_cmd`, and `False` otherwise.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function parses the output from `run_hive_cmd` and determines the existence of the table or partition.
4. The current implementation of the function does not handle the case where the table or partition name is included in the output but separated by a newline character.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the way the function checks for table existence based on the output of `run_hive_cmd`. It fails to handle the case where the table name is included in the output with a newline character separating it from other text. This results in incorrect evaluation of whether the table exists or not.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function processes the output from `run_hive_cmd` in the case where the table name is included with newline characters. By splitting the output and checking for the presence of the table name in each line, we can accurately determine if the table exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` and checking for the existence of the table name in the lines, the corrected function should now accurately determine if the table exists or not, passing the failing tests.
