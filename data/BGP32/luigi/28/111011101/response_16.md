### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `stdout` variable to check if the `table` exists in the output. In the failing tests, `stdout` contains multiple lines of output with the table names, but the function only checks if the exact `table` name is present in `stdout` without considering the additional newline characters. This leads to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of the `table` name in the `stdout` variable. We should split the `stdout` string by newline characters and then check if the `table` exists in any of the resulting lines. This approach will correctly handle cases where multiple table names are present in the output.

### Corrected Code
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.splitlines()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` string using `splitlines()` before checking if the table exists, the corrected function will accurately determine table existence in the hive output, passing the failing tests.
