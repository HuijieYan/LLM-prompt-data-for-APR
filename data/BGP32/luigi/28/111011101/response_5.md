### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in Hive.
2. The issue arises from the comparison of the expected table name with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which is not handling the case sensitivity correctly.
3. The failing tests are failing because the comparison is case sensitive, leading to false positives when the table name is in a different case in Hive compared to the input table name.
4. To fix the bug, we need to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the input table name and the tables listed in the output of `run_hive_cmd`.
5. We can achieve this by converting both the table names to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.splitlines())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the input table name and the tables listed in the output of `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table in Hive. This fix addresses the bug and makes the function behavior consistent with the expected values.
