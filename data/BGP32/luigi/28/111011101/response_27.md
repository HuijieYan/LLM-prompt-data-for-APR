### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout` variable. The bug occurs because the `stdout` value includes the table name concatenated with other text, leading to a false negative when checking for table existence.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify how we check for the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable. We should split the `stdout` based on new lines and then check if the exact table name is present in the resulting list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on new lines and checking for the exact table name in the list obtained, we ensure a more accurate check for the existence of the table. This should fix the issue in the `table_exists` function.
