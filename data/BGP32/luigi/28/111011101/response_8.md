### Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the existence of a table. The function returns the truthiness of the `stdout` variable, which doesn't always reflect the correct state of table existence. Specifically, if the `stdout` contains the table name but additional content, the function incorrectly considers the table as non-existent.

### Bug explanation
1. In Case 2, the function receives the correct `stdout` value, containing both the new line character and the table name. The current implementation fails to account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect return value and causing the test to fail.
2. This discrepancy also causes Case 5 to fail, even though the actual behavior should consider the table exists based on the presence of the table name in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs a more robust check to accurately determine the presence of a table in the `stdout` string. The presence of the table name should be the sole criterion for existence, regardless of any additional content or formatting in `stdout`.

### Updated Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        # Check if the table name is in stdout regardless of additional content
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        # Check if stdout is not empty to confirm table existence
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on new lines before checking the existence of the table name, the function accurately determines the table's presence without being affected by additional content. This modification ensures that the function behaves as expected and fixes the bug.
