### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison statement `return stdout and table in stdout`. When `stdout` is not empty but doesn't contain the exact table name, the comparison evaluates to `False`. This leads to incorrect results in the failing test cases where the table name is contained within the `stdout` but with additional content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to check if the whole table name is present within `stdout`, rather than a partial match. We can do this by splitting `stdout` into lines and comparing each line with the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        if stdout:
            return any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        return False
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        return False
``` 

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` by line and then check if the table name appears in any of the lines. This modification ensures that we are looking for an exact match of the table name within the retrieved output.
