### Bug and Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the logic in checking the existence of a table in Hive. When the function receives the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, it checks if the `table` string is present in the `stdout` string. However, the checks are simplistic and do not account for cases where the table name might be part of another string in the output.

Specifically, in the failing tests, for Case 1, the function fails to correctly identify that the table exists when the output includes only 'OK'. For Case 2, the function incorrectly identifies that the table exists when the output includes 'OK\nmytable', as 'mytable' is part of the string before the newline character.

### Correction Strategy
To fix the bug, a more robust approach is needed to ensure accurate table existence checking. We can modify the function to look for the table name as a separate word in the output. This can be achieved by splitting the `stdout` string by whitespace and then checking if the `table` string is one of the words in the split list.

### Corrected Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
``` 

By splitting the `stdout` string and checking if the `table` string exists as a separate entity in the split list, we can accurately determine the table's existence, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
