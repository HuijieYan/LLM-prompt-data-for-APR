### Bug Explanation

The bug in the provided function `table_exists` seems to be related to the comparison of the table existence check result in the `stdout`. The function is checking if the exact table name is present in the `stdout`, but the check is failing due to potential additional newlines or formatting issues. This is evident from the failing tests where the expected output is present in the `stdout` with additional newlines, causing the equality check to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the function to account for potential extra whitespaces, newlines, or formatting differences in the `stdout`. One way to address this issue is to strip any extra characters from the `stdout` before comparing it with the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.strip()  # Fix: Strip extra characters before comparison
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

This corrected version of the function should address the bug by removing potential extra characters from the `stdout` before performing the table name comparison, ensuring the tests pass successfully.
