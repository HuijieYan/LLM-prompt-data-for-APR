### Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in a specific database. When no partition is specified, it queries the Hive database to find the table, and when a partition is provided, it checks based on the partition specification.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and the comparison of the table name.

3. The issue arises when checking if the table name exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. The condition `return stdout and table in stdout` can lead to unexpected results due to the presence of the table name in the middle of the output string. This causes the `AssertionError` in the failing tests because the check fails even when the table name is present in the output.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify how we check if the table exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd` to ensure a more reliable comparison.

### Updated Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        # Check if the table name is a separate word in the output
        return stdout and any(s.strip() == table for s in stdout.split("\n"))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        # Check if any partitions are returned
        return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the output of `run_hive_cmd` on newline characters and then comparing each line separately to the table name, we can ensure a more accurate check for the table existence. Additionally, the modification of the second condition to a simple boolean conversion ensures that the function returns `True` when there are partitions in the output.
