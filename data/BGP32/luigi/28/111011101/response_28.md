### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition for checking the presence of the table in the `stdout` variable. The function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout`, but the `stdout` variable can contain more than just the table name. This leads to incorrect evaluations and the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for the existence of the table. Instead of a direct comparison, we should parse the `stdout` variable to extract the table names present in it and then check if the desired table name is among them.

### Corrected Code

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            table_list = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in table_list
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by newline characters to form a `table_list` and then checks if the desired table is in that list. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies the presence of the table in the output.
