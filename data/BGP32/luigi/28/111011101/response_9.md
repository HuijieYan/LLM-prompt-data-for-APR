### Problem Analysis:
The main issue in the provided function is with how it handles the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function tries to check if the table exists in the stdout output by splitting it based on newline characters and searching for the table name in the resulting list. However, this logic is flawed as the presence of the table name alone is not a reliable indicator of the table's existence.

### Bug Explanation:
1. For the first failing test case with `table='mytable'`, the stdout is `'OK'`. Since `'OK'` does not contain the table name, the function wrongly returns `False`.
2. For the second failing test case with `table='MyTable'`, the stdout is `'OK\nmytable'`. The function incorrectly detects `mytable` from the output and returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to accurately determine if the table exists based on the presence of the table name in stdout. To do this, we can split the stdout by newline characters and search for the exact table name with the same case sensitivity.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return stdout
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newline characters and checking for an exact match with the table name, we ensure the function accurately determines table existence. The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output.
