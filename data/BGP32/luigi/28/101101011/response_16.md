The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the fact that the comparison between the expected table name and the tables listed in the `stdout` is case-sensitive. This causes the function to fail when the table names are in different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the expected table name and the tables in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version uses the `lower()` method to convert both the expected table name and the tables in the `stdout` to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to the case sensitivity problem.
