## Correction

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs due to the case sensitivity of the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. Since Hive is case-insensitive, the table name should be compared in a case-insensitive manner. However, the buggy function does a case-sensitive check using `table in stdout`, leading to test failures when the case of the table name does not match the case in the output.

### Proposed Fix
To address the bug, the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command should be done in a case-insensitive manner. One way to achieve this is by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase in the comparison, the function now performs a case-insensitive check, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.

### Additional notes
Ensure to also update the test case `test_table_exists` in the `hive_test.py` file to reflect the case-insensitive comparison when asserting the results. This update will validate that the corrected function works as expected.

By implementing the above correction and updating the test cases, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
