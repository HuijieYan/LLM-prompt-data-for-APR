### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does case-sensitive comparison when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The failing test cases reveal that the function fails when the table names are provided in different cases.

The issue on GitHub suggests that the function should be adjusted to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison, making it case-insensitive.
2. Update the function to return `True` if the table is found in stdout (after conversion to lowercase), else `False`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive in the corrected function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the related GitHub issue.
