## Identified bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not perform a case-insensitive check when comparing the table name from the `stdout` with the provided table name. This leads to failing tests, especially when the provided table name is in a different case from the one retrieved from `stdout`.

## Bug explanation:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the file `luigi/contrib/hive.py` has a flaw in the comparison logic. The function queries Hive for table existence and then performs a simple string containment check. However, the check is case-sensitive, leading to failing tests as shown in the provided failing test function.

## Proposed fix:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, it is necessary to convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is not affected by the case of the characters.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing this change to convert both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now be case-insensitive when checking table existence, resolving the failing tests.
