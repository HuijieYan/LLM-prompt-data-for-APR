The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity in comparing the table name in the Hive output. The `table_exists` function is case-sensitive when checking if the table exists in the `stdout` output. This causes the test cases to fail when the table name casing does not match exactly.

To fix this issue, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the function will now correctly check whether the table exists in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the failing test cases.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue that was raised regarding the case sensitivity of the `table_exists` function and provides a solution to make the comparison case insensitive.
