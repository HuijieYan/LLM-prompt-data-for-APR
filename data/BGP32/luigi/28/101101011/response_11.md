### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database but has a case sensitivity issue.
2. The function does not handle case-insensitive table name comparisons correctly, leading to test failures.
3. The bug is due to comparing the table name directly with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase.
5. We will modify the function to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, we ensure that the table existence check is case-insensitive as required. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and resolves the failing tests.
