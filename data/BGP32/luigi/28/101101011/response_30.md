The buggy function `table_exists` fails to correctly check the existence of a table due to a case sensitivity issue where the table name is not matched in a case-insensitive manner. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to query Hive and check if the table exists. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison check to be case insensitive by converting both the table name and the retrieved tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the issue on GitHub suggests this fix to enhance the function's behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase, we ensure a case-insensitive comparison that aligns with the expected behavior from the failing test cases.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
