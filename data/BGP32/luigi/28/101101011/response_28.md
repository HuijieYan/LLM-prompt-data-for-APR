## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database, with an optional partition specification.
2. The bug arises from a case-sensitive comparison between the table name and the stdout output.
3. The failing test cases are due to the case sensitivity of the comparison in the buggy function. For example, in Case 2, the table name is 'MyTable' but the stdout returns 'OK\nmytable', causing the comparison to fail.
4. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the bug related to case sensitivity should be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub.
