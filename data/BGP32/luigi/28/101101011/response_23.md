## Proposed Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity correctly when comparing the table name in the stdout with the provided table name. The function needs to convert both names to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this corrected version, both the input table name and the table names retrieved from stdout are converted to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive match.

This correction should address the failing tests and also align with the GitHub issue raised regarding making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.

Feel free to test this corrected version with the failing test cases provided to confirm the fix.
