## Correction:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The relative path of the corrected test file: test/contrib/hive_test.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Implementation of the run_hive_cmd function should be properly defined

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Implementation of the partition_spec function should be properly defined


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the main fix is in the `table_exists` function. The comparison of the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` is now case-insensitive by using `table.lower()` and `stdout.lower()`. This change addresses the issue identified in the GitHub posts.

Additionally, the return values are properly handled to ensure consistency and correctness in the function's logic.

Make sure to implement the missing parts like `run_hive_cmd` and `partition_spec` accurately based on the specific requirements and functionalities of the application.
