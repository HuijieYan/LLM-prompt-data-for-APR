## Identified Bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it checks for the exact match between the table name and the tables listed in the `stdout`. This causes the test case to fail when the table name is in a different case than the tables listed in `stdout`.

## Root Cause:

The root cause of the bug is that the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison between the table name and the tables listed in `stdout`, without considering case sensitivity. Since Hive is case-insensitive, it returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail.

## Proposed Fix:

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the values in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we ensure a case-insensitive check to determine whether the table exists or not.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
