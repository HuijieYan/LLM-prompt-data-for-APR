## Corrections to the Buggy Function

There are two main issues with the original `table_exists` function in `HiveCommandClient`:

1. The comparison between the table name and the stdout is case sensitive, leading to test failures when the case of table names differs.
2. The partition specification is not correctly handled when verifying the existence of a partitioned table.

To address these issues, we need to modify the function as follows:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    table_lower = table.lower()
    
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table_lower))
    
        return stdout and table_lower in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_clause = ", ".join(["{k}='{v}'".format(k=key, v=value) for key, value in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {db}; show partitions {tb} partition ({pc});".format(db=database, tb=table_lower, pc=partition_clause))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We store the lowercase version of the table name to ensure case insensitivity.
- We also convert the stdout and table names to lowercase before comparison to correctly handle case sensitivity issues.
- For partitioned tables, we construct the partition specification dynamically based on the input dictionary.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles case sensitivity in table names and properly constructs partition specifications.

These modifications should resolve the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
