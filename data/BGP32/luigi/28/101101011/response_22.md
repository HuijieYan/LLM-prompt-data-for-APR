### Identified Bug:

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class fails to handle case sensitivity correctly when checking for the existence of a table. This leads to failing tests because the function does a strict comparison without considering the case of the table names.

### Cause of the Bug:

1. In the `table_exists` function, the comparison `table in stdout` checks for an exact match between the table name and the output from the `show tables` command. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this comparison fails when the case of the table name in the output does not match the input table name-casing.
   
2. The failing test cases indicate scenarios where the table names in the output have different casings compared to the input table names, causing the function to return incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to do a case-insensitive comparison between the input table name and the table names obtained from the Hive command output.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` Function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The corrected version of the function includes converting both the input table name and the table names obtained from the Hive command output to lower case for a case-insensitive comparison.

This fix ensures that the function can correctly identify the existence of tables irrespective of the casing in the Hive output.

By applying this correction, the function will pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issues related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
