### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command. The function needs to make the comparison case insensitive to address this problem.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from comparing the `table` variable directly with the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. Since Hive is case insensitive, the table names in the output might not match the given table name properly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase (or uppercase) before the comparison. This will ensure a case-insensitive match and resolve the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case insensitivity
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By implementing this change, the `table_exists` function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the given table name and the table names present in the Hive output. This corrected version should address the failing test cases related to case sensitivity issues.
