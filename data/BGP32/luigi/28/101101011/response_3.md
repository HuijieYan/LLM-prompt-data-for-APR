## Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class has a bug where it does not handle case insensitivity properly while checking table existence in Hive. The function needs to correctly compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to match the table names returned by Hive, which are case-insensitive.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function compares the table name directly with the output from Hive without normalizing the case, leading to inconsistencies and failing tests.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive and accurate.

## Updated Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the Hive output to lowercase before comparison, making the check case-insensitive. This change ensures that the function will pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue raised in the GitHub thread.
