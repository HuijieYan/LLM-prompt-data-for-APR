The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` obtained from running the Hive command. Since the `stdout` is not case-insensitive, it causes the comparison to fail in situations where the table names have different cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to be case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, we ensure that the check is case-insensitive.

This change aligns with the proposed fix in GitHub issue #896, which aims to make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
