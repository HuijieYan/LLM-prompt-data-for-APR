## Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function with the table name. To resolve this bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, we need to convert both the output and the table name to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

With this correction, the function will compare the table name and the output in a case-insensitive manner, resolving the issue described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

This correction ensures that the `table_exists` function accurately checks for the existence of a table without being affected by the case of the table name.
