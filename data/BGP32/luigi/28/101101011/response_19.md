## Correction:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the `stdout` with the provided input `table`. To fix this bug, we need to make the comparison case insensitive.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparing them, making the comparison case insensitive. This correction aligns with the suggestions in the GitHub issues provided.

By adopting this correction, the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to case insensitivity in table existence checks.
