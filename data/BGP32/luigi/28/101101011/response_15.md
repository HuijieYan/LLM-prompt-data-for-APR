## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

## Explanation:

### Bug:
The bug in the original `table_exists` function was that it was comparing the table name directly with the output from Hive, which could have mismatched case sensitivity, leading to failing tests.

### Cause:
The bug was causing the test cases to fail because the `table_exists` function was not handling case sensitivity properly. The test cases were expecting case-insensitive behavior while checking for the existence of tables, but the function was performing a direct comparison without considering case sensitivity.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function now converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence and resolves the failing test cases.

### Additional Note:
The fix aligns with the GitHub issue raised (#896) to make the `table_exists` function case insensitive. The correction addresses the test failures and ensures that the function behaves as expected in a case-insensitive manner when checking for the existence of tables.
