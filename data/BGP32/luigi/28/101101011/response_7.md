## Identified Bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity of comparing the table name with the tables returned in the `stdout` from the Hive command. The function compares the table name directly with the `stdout`, leading to cases where the table name may be in a different case, causing the comparison to fail.

## Solution Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the strings in the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

## Corrected Version of the buggy function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- We convert both `table` and the strings in `stdout` to lowercase using `lower()` before comparison to make the check case insensitive.
- For readability and consistency, the second check `if stdout:` is simplified to `return bool(stdout)`.

By implementing these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing test cases and address the case sensitivity issue reported in GitHub.
