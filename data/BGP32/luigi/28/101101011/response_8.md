The buggy function `table_exists` has an issue related to case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. The function compares the table name extracted from the stdout with the provided table name without considering case differences, which leads to failing tests due to case sensitivity.

To fix this bug, the comparison should be made case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the extracted table name from stdout to lower case before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the extracted table name from stdout to lower case, the function now performs a case-insensitive comparison. This modification addresses the failing test cases and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub thread.
