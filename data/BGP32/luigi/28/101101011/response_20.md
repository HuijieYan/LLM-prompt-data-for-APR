### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is failing tests due to case sensitivity issues when comparing the table names from `stdout`.
2. The function does not handle case insensitivity properly, leading to test failures giving different test cases where the table names are in different cases.
3. When the table names are compared without case sensitivity, the function should return the correct result as specified in the failing tests.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case insensitive using lowercase versions of the table names.
5. The expected corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Import the required functions
import re

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            
            # Checking for case insensitive table name match
            return stdout and bool(re.search(r'\b{}\b'.format(re.escape(table.lower())), stdout.lower()))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                    (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

After applying the fixed version of the `table_exists` function with case insensitivity in table name comparisons, the function should now pass the failing tests provided, resolving the issue mentioned on GitHub related to making the function case insensitive.
