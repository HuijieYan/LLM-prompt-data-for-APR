## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is intended to check if a table exists in a database in Hive.
2. The bug occurs because the comparison between the `table` name and the `stdout` where the table names are listed is case-sensitive. This causes the tests to fail when the cases don't match.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate scenarios where the expected `stdout` contains the table names in lowercase, but the provided `table` names are in different cases (upper or mixed). Since Hive is case-insensitive, the comparison should also ignore case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function should perform a case-insensitive comparison.

## Correction:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class will perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking if a table exists in Hive. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and should make the function pass the failing tests.
