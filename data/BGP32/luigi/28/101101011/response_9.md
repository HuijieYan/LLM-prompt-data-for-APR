### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of the table name with the stdout in the `table_exists` function might not consider case sensitivity.
2. The function might not properly handle uppercase and lowercase letters in table names.

### Bug Explanation:
The current implementation of the `table_exists` function does a direct comparison between the provided table name and the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. This direct comparison is case-sensitive, which causes the tests to fail when the case of the table name does not match exactly with the table name in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the function case-insensitive, we should update the comparison logic to ensure that the case of the table name is not a factor in determining table existence.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We convert both the input table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
2. We use the `in` operator to check if the table name exists in the output.
3. We directly return the boolean result of the existence check for simplicity.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should now be able to handle case-insensitive comparisons between table names, resolving the issue and passing the failing test cases.
