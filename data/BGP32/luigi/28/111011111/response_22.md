### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is intended to check if a table exists in a given Hive database, handling the case where the table name might be capitalized differently. The failing tests indicate that the function is not returning the expected results when dealing with case sensitivity.

The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive queries and check the output for the existence of the table name. The issue at hand seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the output.

### Potential error locations

1. The comparison of the `table` name with the output from `run_hive_cmd` might be case-sensitive, leading to incorrect results.
2. The logic of checking for table existence based solely on text presence in the command output can introduce false positives or negatives due to case mismatch.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug arises from the lack of case-insensitive comparison between the provided `table` name and the `stdout` obtained from the Hive command execution. Since Hive is case insensitive, the function should be modified to account for this and perform a case-insensitive check for table existence.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, it is essential to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` content to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison. This approach ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, aligning with the behavior of Hive.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(
            "use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
        )

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- Both the `table` name and the `stdout` content are converted to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.
- The function returns `True` if `stdout` contains the specified table (ignoring case).

By making these modifications, the `table_exists` function should now handle case insensitivity correctly, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub comments.
