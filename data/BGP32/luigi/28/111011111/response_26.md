### Analyze the buggy function

The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the tables listed in the Hive output. The case sensitivity of the comparison leads to test failures when the table names don't match exactly. The bug is related to the case sensitivity issue, as highlighted in the GitHub issues.

### Potential error locations

1. The comparison of table names in the `table_exists` function.
2. The construction of Hive queries within the function.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug lies in the comparison of the `table` parameter with the tables listed in the Hive output. Hive is case-insensitive, so the table name retrieved from the Hive output might not match the exact case of the input table name for the function.

The failing test cases highlight scenarios where the expected table name cases do not match the case of the table names retrieved from Hive, leading to assertion failures.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to be case-insensitive by converting table names to lower case before comparison. This change will ensure that the function can correctly identify the existence of tables irrespective of their case.

### Corrected version of the `table_exists` function

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, both the input table name and the table names retrieved from Hive are converted to lower case before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence. This change aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and resolves the test failures related to case sensitivity.
