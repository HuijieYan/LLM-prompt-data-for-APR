### Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is failing the test cases because it directly compares the table name from the input parameter to the result obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. The expected behavior is for the comparison to be case insensitive.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name in the `table_exists` function with the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity. This results in a mismatch when the table names have different cases.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should convert both the table name and the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function will pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
