### Analysis
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The function checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database, but it compares the table names without considering case differences which leads to test failures.
3. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and verify table existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to make it case insensitive.
5. The provided fix should resolve the issue by ensuring case insensitivity when checking table existence.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the comparison in the `table_exists` function between the provided table name and the table names returned by Hive, without considering case sensitivity. This leads to incorrect comparisons and test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to convert both the provided table name and the table names returned from Hive to lowercase before comparing them in the `table_exists` function. This will make the comparison case insensitive and resolve the test failures.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity when checking for table existence. This adjustment should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
