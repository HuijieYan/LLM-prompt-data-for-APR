### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the tests due to a case sensitivity issue. The function compares the table name from the input parameter with the tables listed in the Hive output, which might not match due to case differences. The bug causes the test to fail when the provided table name is different in case from the table names in the Hive output.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug and make the comparison case-insensitive, the function should convert both the input table name and the table names retrieved from Hive output to lowercase before comparison. This adjustment will ensure correct matching regardless of the case. By updating the comparison logic to use lowercase versions of the strings, the function will pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the entries in `stdout` to lowercase, the corrected function ensures a case-insensitive comparison for table existence checking. This modification addresses the issue reported in the failing tests and aligns with the expected behavior described for the function.
