### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The issue arises when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command, causing case sensitivity problems.
2. The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command is case-sensitive, leading to failed tests that expect case-insensitive behavior.
3. The failing tests show that when the table name differs in case from the output, the comparison fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to be case-insensitive.
5. A corrected version of the function should compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from the Hive command to ensure case-insensitivity.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
- The comparison `table.lower() in stdout.lower()` is used to compare the lowercased table name with the lowercased output from the Hive command, ensuring case-insensitive matching.
- The return statement for the case with a partition has been simplified to return `bool(stdout)` directly for clarity and consistency.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should resolve the failing tests related to case sensitivity in table existence checks.
