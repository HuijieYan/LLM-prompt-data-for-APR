### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a specified database. The issue arises from case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout` output.
2. The bug occurs because the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output is case sensitive. This leads to test failures when the table name is not in the expected case.
3. The function should ensure case insensitivity when comparing the table name in the `stdout` output to fix the failing tests.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the `stdout` output to a consistent case for comparison. By converting both to lowercase, we can ensure case insensitivity in the comparison.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` name and the `stdout` output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This ensures that the comparison is now case insensitive and resolves the failing tests related to the issue of case sensitivity in table existence checks.
