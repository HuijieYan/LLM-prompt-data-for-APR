The buggy function is `table_exists` inside the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison `table in stdout` is case-sensitive and can be problematic when table names are not in the exact case.
2. The comparison in the else block also seems to suffer from the same case sensitivity issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the fact that the comparison in both branches of the `if` statement is case-sensitive. Hive is case-insensitive when it comes to table names, so the comparisons should consider that aspect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this issue, we need to convert both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase (or uppercase) to make a case-insensitive comparison that aligns with Hive's behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase in the comparison, the function now behaves in a case-insensitive manner, which aligns with the expected behavior in the Hive environment.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test cases mentioned and align with the expectations documented for various scenarios.
