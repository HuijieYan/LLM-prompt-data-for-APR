Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is due to a case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name extracted from `stdout` with the given table name. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function fails to recognize existing tables due to case mismatches.

To fix this bug, the comparison between the table name and the tables listed in `stdout` needs to be case insensitive. By converting both strings to lowercase before comparison, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies the table's existence regardless of the case.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                       (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function converts both the given table name and the table names extracted from `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This change ensures that the function is case insensitive when checking for table existence.

This updated version should resolve the failing tests related to case sensitivity issues in the `table_exists` function.
