### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from the comparison of the `table` name with the contents of `stdout` without considering case sensitivity. The function checks if the `table` name is in `stdout`, but due to case differences, the comparison fails.

In the failing tests, specifically Case 1 and Case 2, the `table` name differs in case from what is returned in `stdout`. This discrepancy causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to test failures.

To resolve this bug, the comparison between the `table` name and the contents of `stdout` needs to be case-insensitive.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug and make the `table_exists` function case-insensitive, the comparison between the `table` name and the contents of `stdout` should be performed in a case-insensitive manner. One way to achieve this is by converting both the `table` name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison, the function will be able to correctly identify if the table exists regardless of case differences. This solution aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue and should address the failing test cases.
