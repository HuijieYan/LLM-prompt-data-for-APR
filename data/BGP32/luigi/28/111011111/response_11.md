### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the class `HiveCommandClient` is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database using an SQL query.
2. The bug occurs due to a case-sensitive check when comparing the table name retrieved from Hive with the table name provided in the function call.
3. The failing tests demonstrate that the function fails to recognize table names with different casing due to a direct string match.
4. The function should compare the table names without considering the case to ensure accurate table existence checks.
5. The GitHub issue and proposed fix suggest making the `table_exists` function case-insensitive by converting both the retrieved table name and the provided table name to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the retrieved table name from Hive and the provided table name to lowercase before performing the comparison.
2. By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function will correctly identify tables regardless of their casing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                           (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With the corrected implementation, the function will correctly identify whether a table exists in the specified database regardless of the casing. This change aligns with the proposed fix for the GitHub issue and addresses the failing tests reported.
