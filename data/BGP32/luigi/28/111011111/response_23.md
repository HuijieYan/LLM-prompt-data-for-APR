### Buggy Function Explanation:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks for the existence of a table in the specified database by running a Hive command and inspecting the output. The bug occurs due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output obtained from the Hive command. The failing test cases demonstrate the issue where the table name is capitalized in the function call but returned in lowercase from the Hive command, leading to assertion failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case-insensitive. By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the function will accommodate variations in case sensitivity.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during comparison, the corrected function will now handle case insensitivity issues and pass the failing test cases.
