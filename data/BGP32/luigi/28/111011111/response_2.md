### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if the table exists in the stdout from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The failing tests are asserting the expected behavior for case sensitivity, which is not met by the current implementation of the `table_exists` function.
3. The expected behavior is to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to the output received from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. The fix should involve converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison to ensure case insensitivity.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert the table name to lowercase.
2. Also, convert the stdout to lowercase before checking if the table exists.
3. This modification will ensure that the comparison is case-insensitive, resolving the failing tests related to case sensitivity.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests related to case sensitivity.
