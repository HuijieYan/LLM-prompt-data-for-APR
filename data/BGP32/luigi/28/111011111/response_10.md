Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity of checking whether a table exists. The function compares the table name as is with the stdout, which is causing the test failures when the case of the table name doesn't match that in stdout.

To fix the bug, the comparison between the table name and the stdout needs to be made case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This corrected version ensures that both the table name and the stdout are treated in a case-insensitive manner for comparison, addressing the issue raised in the failing tests and the associated GitHub issue.
