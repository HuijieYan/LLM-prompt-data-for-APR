### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is failing the tests due to case sensitivity in comparing the table name present in `stdout` with the provided table name.
2. The issue arises because the comparison between the table name and the `stdout` is case sensitive, causing the test assertions to fail.
3. The expected behavior should be to make the comparison case insensitive to match the behavior of Hive, as discussed in the GitHub issues.
4. The fix involves converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison to ensure a case-insensitive match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Create a case-insensitive comparison by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
  
### Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to be case insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issues.
