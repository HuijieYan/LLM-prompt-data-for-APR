### Analysis
The bug lies in the `table_exists` function of the `HiveCommandClient` class. The function compares the table name in a case-sensitive manner with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Since Hive is case-insensitive, this leads to test failures when the case of the table name differs from the one retrieved from Hive.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the `table_exists` function compares the table name directly without considering case differences. This leads to false negatives when the retrieved table name from Hive is in a different case.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

### Corrected Version Explanation
The corrected version converts both the table name and the output from Hive to lowercase before comparing them. This makes the comparison case-insensitive and resolves the issue causing test failures. Now, the function should behave correctly according to the expected behavior mentioned in the failing test cases.
