### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is not handling case sensitivity correctly when checking if a table exists in Hive.
2. The bug arises because the function is comparing the table name directly with the stdout, leading to case sensitivity issues.
3. When the table name in Hive is different in case from what is passed to the function, the function incorrectly returns false.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and stdout is case insensitive.
5. A possible strategy to fix this bug is to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase or uppercase before comparison to make it case insensitive.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase or uppercase before comparison, we ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table in Hive. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
