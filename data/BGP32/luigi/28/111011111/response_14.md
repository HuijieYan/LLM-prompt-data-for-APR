Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, here is the explanation of the bug:

### Bug Explanation:
The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the Hive database. However, the comparison between the table name passed as input and the table names extracted from the Hive command output (`stdout`) is case-sensitive. This results in failing tests when the table names have different cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```
and the line:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout
```

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison between the `table` and the names retrieved from `stdout` not being case-insensitive. In certain cases where the table names have different cases, the comparison fails leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison between the `table` and the names extracted from `stdout` needs to be made case-insensitive.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and the table names extracted from `stdout` to lower case, the bug is fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing tests while satisfying the expected input/output values and also addresses the GitHub issue by making the `table_exists` function case insensitive.
