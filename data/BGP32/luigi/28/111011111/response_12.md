### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` file is failing tests due to case sensitivity issues in comparing table names.
2. The function calls `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands to check if a table exists. The issue arises when comparing the table name extracted from the Hive output with the table name provided, as they may have different cases.
3. The failing test cases demonstrate inconsistencies in case matching, leading to failed assertions. The expected behavior is for the comparison to be case-insensitive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure case insensitivity while checking table existence.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, update the comparison logic to convert both the extracted table name from Hive output and the provided table name to lowercase for a case-insensitive check.
2. Modify the `table_exists` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison.
3. Ensure that the function returns `True` if the table exists (ignoring case) and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison in the `table_exists` function to use lowercase versions of both table names, we ensure a case-insensitive check for table existence. This corrected version should resolve the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
