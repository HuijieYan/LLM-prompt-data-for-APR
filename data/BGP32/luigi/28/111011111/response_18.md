### Analyzing the bug:

1. **Buggy Function**: The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive commands.

2. **Related Functions**:
   - `run_hive_cmd`: This function is called by `table_exists` to execute Hive commands but is not directly related to the bug.
   - `partition_spec`: This function is called within the buggy part of `table_exists` to construct partition specifications but does not directly affect the bug.

3. **Error Location**:
   - The bug arises in the comparison of table names within the `stdout` received from Hive commands.
  
4. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs due to a case sensitivity issue in the comparison of the table name in `stdout` and the provided table name. Hive returns table names in lowercase, causing the comparison to fail when the input table name is in a different case.

5. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, convert both the table name from the input and the table name from the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

### Corrected Function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Summary:
- The corrected function converts both the input table name and the table name from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.
- This modification resolves the case sensitivity issue, ensuring that the comparison is valid regardless of the case of the table names.
- The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to making `table_exists` case insensitive.
