The bug in the `table_exists` function stems from not properly checking the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The cause of the bug can be traced to how the function checks for the table name in the `stdout`. When there are multiple lines in the `stdout`, the buggy function does not correctly parse and check each line for the table name, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to split the `stdout` by lines and check each line to ensure that the table name is present.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected version splits the `stdout` by lines and checks if the table name is present in any of the lines. It also simplifies the return logic based on the presence of `stdout`.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing tests.
