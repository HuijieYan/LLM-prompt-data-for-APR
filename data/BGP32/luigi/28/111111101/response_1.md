### Bug Explanation
The bug is in the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. The function checks if the table name is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function to determine if the table exists. However, the logic is incorrect as it fails to handle cases where the table name might be a substring of another table name in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function to ensure that the exact matching table name is checked in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout string by newline characters before checking for the table name, we ensure that the function only considers exact table name matches rather than partial matches. This correction should address the bug and make the failing tests pass.
