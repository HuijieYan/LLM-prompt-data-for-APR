The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it incorrectly checks the existence of a table based on the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, without handling case sensitivity properly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the comparison to be case-insensitive when checking if the table exists in the output. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparing them, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.

Running the failing tests after applying this fix should now pass.
