The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database. The issue stems from how the function is comparing the table name in the `stdout` variable. The buggy function is using a simple string comparison, which can lead to false positives or negatives due to partial matches.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to ensure an exact match of the table name in the `stdout`. We can split the `stdout` by newlines and then check for the exact table name in the resulting list.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# imports required for the corrected function
import re

def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return bool(re.search(r'(\n|^)%s(\n|$)' % re.escape(table), stdout))
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newline characters and checking for an exact match when returning from the function, we can avoid the false positives or negatives that were occurring. This will ensure that the table existence check is accurate and resolves the issue with the failing test cases.
