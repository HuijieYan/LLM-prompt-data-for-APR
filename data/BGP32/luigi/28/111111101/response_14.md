The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checks for the presence of the table name in the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The buggy function incorrectly checks for the table name in the stdout without considering line breaks or additional characters. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checks to properly handle the table name verification against the stdout.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` on line breaks and directly checking for the existence of the table name within the lines, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values.
