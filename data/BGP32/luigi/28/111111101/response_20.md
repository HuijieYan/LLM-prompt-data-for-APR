The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the exact presence of the table name in the output, which can lead to incorrect results in cases where the table name might appear as part of another word.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to check for a more accurate match. We can split the `stdout` based on newlines and then search for an exact match of the table name in the list of lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))
    
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By using `any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n'))`, we ensure that we are checking for an exact match of the table name within the lines of the output. This will prevent false positives and fix the bug in the function.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases mentioned.
