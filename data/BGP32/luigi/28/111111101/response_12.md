### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the condition checks for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`. The bug occurs when the `table` name matches a substring within another table name in the `stdout`. This mismatch triggers the incorrect return value, leading to failed tests.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the condition that checks for the presence of the `table` in the `stdout`. Instead of directly checking if the `table` is in the `stdout`, we should split the `stdout` by newline characters and then compare the `table` name with each line individually.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the buggy function should now correctly identify the existence of the specified table regardless of the presence of any substrings that might match the `table` name.
