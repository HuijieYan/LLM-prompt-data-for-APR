The bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by the condition checking within the function. The function checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty and if the `table` is present in it to determine if the table exists. However, the condition is incorrect as it always returns `True` even if the table is not present in the output.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the `table` appears as a standalone word in the `stdout`, considering spaces or newlines that might separate the table name.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and '\n{}'.format(table) in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

By checking if `'\n{}` is in the `stdout`, we ensure that the table name is a separate entity in the output. This will correctly determine if the table exists in the database.

After applying this fix, re-run the failing tests for the `HiveCommandClient` class to ensure that the function now behaves as expected and passes all the test cases.
