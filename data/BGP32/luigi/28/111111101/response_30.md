### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the `table` variable. The function checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` by using `table in stdout`. However, this comparison fails when the `table` is a substring of another entry in `stdout`. This leads to incorrect results and failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `if` condition to ensure an exact match between the `table` name and the entries in `stdout`. One way to achieve this is by splitting the `stdout` by newline characters and then checking for an exact match between the `table` and each entry.

### Corrected Code
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` on newline characters before performing the comparison, the function now ensures an exact match with the `table` name, fixing the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.
