### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic that checks the presence of a table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function uses the `stdout` variable to store the output and then checks if the `table` is in `stdout`. However, the bug occurs due to the implementation of this check where an incomplete comparison is made, resulting in incorrect evaluation.

When the `run_hive_cmd` function returns the table name followed by newline characters (`\n`), the presence check fails as the comparison does not properly account for this format. This discrepancy leads to failing tests where the expected string is not correctly matched with the `stdout` value due to the newline character.

### Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to correctly handle the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. Specifically, we should modify the comparison of the `table` with `stdout` to account for the newline characters and whitespace. By considering these formatting issues, the function will be able to accurately determine the presence of the table in the output.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the check for the presence of the `table` in `stdout` is modified to split the `stdout` string by newline characters (`\n`) before performing the comparison. This adjustment ensures that the function properly handles the formatting of the output and accurately determines the existence of the table.
