### Correction:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version of the `table_exists` function, the key modification is the addition of `.split('\n')` to the `stdout` variable when `partition` is None. This change enables comparing the table name against a list of tables rather than a single string, fixing the comparison logic.

Additionally, in the `else` block, the string formatting syntax is adjusted correctly to include placeholders `{0}`, `{1}`, and `{2}` for database, table, and partition specification respectively.

These adjustments ensure that the function handles the input correctly and provides the expected output based on the defined test cases.
