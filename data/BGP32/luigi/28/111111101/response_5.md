### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition for checking the existence of the table. When the `stdout` contains the table name, the function incorrectly returns `True` when it should actually return `False`, leading to a failed test.

In Case 2, for example, when `table = 'MyTable'`, the function incorrectly returns `True` because it checks if the table name is in the `stdout`, which contains both `OK` and `mytable`. This logic flaw causes the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the formatting of `stdout` to check for the exact occurrence of the table name in a separate line, matching the expected values. This change will ensure that the function behaves correctly in all cases and passes the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and '\n' + table + '\n' in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
``` 

With this updated version of the `table_exists` function, the buggy logic of checking for the table name in `stdout` has been fixed. The corrected version will now correctly compare if the table name appears on its own line in the `stdout` output, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
