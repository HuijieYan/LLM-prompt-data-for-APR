The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic of the returned `stdout` variable. The function is expecting `table in stdout` to evaluate to `True`, which is incorrect for cases where `stdout` contains multiple lines. Instead of checking if the exact `table` string is present in `stdout`, the function should split the `stdout` by newline characters and then check if any line contains the exact `table` string.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `table_exists` function. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                          (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function splits the `stdout` variable by newline characters and uses the `in` operator to check if the exact `table` string is present in any of the lines. The function now returns `True` if the table exists in the stdout, and `False` otherwise.

This correction should address the issue observed in the failing test cases and ensure that the function correctly determines whether a table exists in the hive database.
