### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition checking logic. The current implementation checks if the table is in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function directly. However, the expected output is not just the presence of the table name in the output, but rather a specific format (`table\n<tablename>`).

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to correctly parse the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function and check if the table name is present in the expected format.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table + '\n' in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

# Explanation for the change:
# - In the first conditional block, we modify the return statement to check if the table name is in the format 'tablename\n'.
# - In the second conditional block, we simply return the boolean value of `stdout` to indicate if partitions were found or not.
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected `table_exists` function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected values in all scenarios.
