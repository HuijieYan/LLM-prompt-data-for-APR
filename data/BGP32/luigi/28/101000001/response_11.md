## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a database with an optional partition. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and check the output. The issue might be related to how the Hive commands are constructed in the if-else branches of the function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The construction of the Hive command in the else branch might be incorrect, leading to a faulty query.
2. Handling of the stdout variable in the if-else branches could be incorrect.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug might be caused by the incorrect construction of the Hive command in the else branch of the function. The formatting of the string might not be proper or might not result in a valid Hive command. Additionally, the handling of the stdout variable after executing the Hive command might produce unexpected results due to incorrect conditions.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the else branch to correctly construct the Hive command using the `partition_spec` function and proper string formatting.
2. Ensure that the conditions checking the stdout variable are accurate and provide the expected outcome.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the Hive command in the else branch is constructed using proper string formatting and the `partition_spec` function. The stdout handling and conditions to check the existence of the table in the database with or without a partition are appropriately managed.
