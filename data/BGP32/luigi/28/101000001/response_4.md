1. The buggy function `table_exists` is attempting to check if a given table exists in a specified database with an optional partition. It depends on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are the `stdout` variables assignment within the if-else blocks.

3. The cause of the bug lies in how the conditionals are handled. In the first conditional (partition is None case), the function tries to check if the table name exists in the `stdout`, but the logic is incorrect in evaluating the presence of the table.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the way we handle the conditionals and validate the `stdout` output differently for both cases.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {0} like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        
        return stdout is not None
```

In the corrected version:
- In the first case (partition is None), we changed the Hive command to `show tables in {0} like "{1}";` to correctly list tables in the specified database.
- In both cases, we changed the conditionals to check if `stdout` has a valid output, rather than just checking for its existence. This ensures a more robust check for table existence.
