## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is trying to check if a table exists in a Hive database based on certain conditions. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output. The issue seems to be related to how the Hive commands are being constructed and executed within the `if` and `else` branches.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect construction of Hive commands in the `else` branch.
2. Incorrect handling of the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect construction of the Hive command in the `else` branch. The string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` call within the `else` branch is not correct, and this may lead to errors in executing the Hive command.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command is properly formatted and executed in both the `if` and `else` branches. Proper handling of command outputs is also necessary to accurately determine if the table exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_condition = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, partition_condition))
        return stdout is not None and len(stdout) > 0
``` 

In the corrected version, the Hive command in the `else` branch is properly constructed using string formatting. Additionally, the output checking is improved to ensure that the function returns `True` only if the table exists. By validating the length of the output, we can have a more accurate determination of table existence.
