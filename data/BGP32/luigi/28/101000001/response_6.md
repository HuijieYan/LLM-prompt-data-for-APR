## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `run_hive_cmd` function might have an issue that is causing incorrect behavior.
2. The string formatting in the `stdout` assignment for both cases (with and without partition) could be incorrect.
3. The condition `stdout and table in stdout` might not be evaluating as expected.

## Bug Explanation:
1. In the `table_exists` function, the `stdout` variable is being assigned the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function, which could be problematic.
2. The `stdout` variable is then being checked with a condition `stdout and table in stdout`, but it's unclear if this condition is correctly evaluating the existence of the table.
3. The string formatting in the assignment of `stdout` for the case with a partition is not ideal and might lead to incorrect command execution.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `run_hive_cmd` function for any issues that might cause incorrect command execution or output.
2. Modify the string formatting in the `stdout` assignment to ensure the correct query is sent to Hive for both cases (with and without partition).
3. Refactor the condition checking for table existence in the `stdout` variable to accurately determine if the table exists in the output.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
    
            return table in stdout if stdout else False
        else:
            partition_clause = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_clause})')
    
            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, the string formatting for the `stdout` assignment has been improved, and the condition checking for table existence has been updated to handle the `None` case properly. Additionally, the syntax for f-strings is used for better readability.
