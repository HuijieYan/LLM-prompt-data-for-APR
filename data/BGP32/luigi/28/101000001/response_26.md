## Correction:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the corrected function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Convert to bool directly from stdout
    
```


1. **Analysis:**
   - The buggy function `table_exists` checks for the existence of a table with or without a partition.
   - It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and determine if a table exists.

2. **Potential Errors:**
   - The string formatting in the Hive command of the `else` branch seems incorrect.
   - No handling of conversion from stdout to boolean is present.

3. **Cause of Bug:**
   - The error in the string formatting within the `else` branch causes the Hive command to be incorrectly formatted, leading to possible syntax errors during execution.
   - Additionally, the stdout check may not properly convert the output to a boolean value for return.

4. **Strategy for Fixing:**
   - Update the string formatting in the `else` branch to correctly format the Hive command.
   - Ensure that the stdout results are properly converted to a boolean value for consistent output.

5. **Corrected Version:**
   - The `table_exists` function has been fixed by correcting the string formatting and converting the stdout result directly to a boolean value.
