The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is that the condition check for the existence of the table is not accurate. The `stdout` variable is not being processed correctly within the function.

The buggy part of the code is the following:
```python
return stdout and table in stdout 
```

The issue with this line is that it doesn't check if the table exactly matches the output from the hive command. Instead, it checks if both `stdout` and `table` are not empty strings, which may lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to explicitly check if the table exists in the output of the hive command. Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout.split()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we split the `stdout` output into a list of tables and check if the exact table name exists within that list. This way, the function accurately determines if the specified table exists in the database.
