## Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `table_exists` is part of the `HiveCommandClient` class in the `luigi/contrib/hive.py` file. It checks for the existence of a table in a Hive database with an optional partition.

## Identifying potential errors
1. The formatting of the SQL queries in the `stdout` assignments to `run_hive_cmd` functions might be incorrect.
2. The comparison of `table in stdout` and the existence check based on the `stdout` variable might not be providing accurate results.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the SQL queries in the `stdout` assignments. Additionally, the logic used to check the existence of the table based on the `stdout` variable might not be handling the result correctly.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Correct the formatting of the SQL queries in the `stdout` assignments.
2. Ensure that the `stdout` variable captures the correct result from `run_hive_cmd`.
3. Implement a reliable method to check the existence of the table and handle different scenarios.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout is not None and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout is not None and len(stdout.splitlines()) > 1
```

In this corrected version:
- I amended the formatting of the SQL query for `show partitions`.
- Modified the condition to check both the existence of the `stdout` and the length of the split lines for accurate determination of partition existence.
- Utilized `split()` and `splitlines()` to process the `stdout` output appropriately.
