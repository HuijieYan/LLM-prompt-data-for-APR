The buggy function `table_exists` is attempting to check if a table exists in Hive by executing a Hive command. The potential error locations in this function are in the two `run_hive_cmd` calls, where the command execution output is not being handled correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the `run_hive_cmd` function may return `None` or an empty string, but the buggy function is not checking for these cases before attempting to process the output.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the `stdout` variable is not `None` or an empty string before proceeding to check if the table exists. Additionally, we should handle any exceptions that may arise from executing the Hive command.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout if stdout else False
    else:
        partition_cmd = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_cmd})")
        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- We check if `stdout` is not `None` before proceeding with `table in stdout` check in the first case.
- We handle the partition command creation separately and use an f-string for better readability in the second case.
- We return `bool(stdout)` instead of explicitly checking for `True` or `False`.

With these modifications, the function should now handle potential issues related to the execution of Hive commands and provide a more robust check for table existence.
