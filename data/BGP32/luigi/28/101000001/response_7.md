## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect usage of format in the `run_hive_cmd` function calls.
2. Incorrect concatenation and formatting of strings in the `run_hive_cmd` function calls.
3. Unhandled exceptions in case of errors in `run_hive_cmd` function calls.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is not correctly using format for string substitution, causing potential errors.
2. The incorrect usage of `%` for string formatting can lead to issues, especially when dealing with multiple parameters.
3. There is no handling of exceptions that might occur in the `run_hive_cmd` function calls, leading to potential unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fixing Strategy:
1. Correct the string formatting in the `run_hive_cmd` calls to use the `format` function properly.
2. Ensure that the string concatenation and formatting are done correctly for the commands passed to `run_hive_cmd`.
3. Implement proper exception handling to catch any errors that might occur during the execution of `run_hive_cmd`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {}; show tables like "{}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {}; show partitions {} partition ({});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
