## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database.
2. The function relies on the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and retrieve the output.
3. The bug likely stems from incorrect formatting of the Hive command string or incorrect usage of the `partition_spec` method.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command string is correctly formatted and the partition specification is properly handled.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the formatting of the Hive command string when a partition is provided. The `stdout` variable is not correctly populated in the case of a partition being passed to the function. This is due to a syntax error in the Hive command string construction. Additionally, the `partition_spec` method may not be returning the expected partition specification.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the Hive command string construction and ensure that the partition specification is correctly obtained. We should correct the syntax of the Hive command string and handle the partition specification appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_str = ', '.join(['%s="%s"' % (k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_str))
        
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that the Hive command string is constructed correctly for the `partition` case. We use `.items()` to iterate over the partition dictionary and properly format the partition specification. This fixed version should handle both cases of no partition and partition provided accurately.
