## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# Import the necessary module to access the run_hive_cmd function
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function, it remains unchanged

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                                    ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_str))

            return bool(stdout)
```

## Analysis
In the buggy version of the `table_exists` function, there was an issue with how the partition specification was being used. The bug is in the formation of the partition string when calling the `run_hive_cmd` function. This could lead to incorrect partition identification and the function not working as intended.

## Identified Error
The error lies in the incorrect creation of the partition string when calling the `run_hive_cmd` function in the else block of the `table_exists` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug was caused by the incorrect usage of the `self.partition_spec` function within the string formatting of the command to check for existing tables with partitions. The partition information was not properly formatted, leading to a failed check and incorrect results.

## Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly construct the partition specification string from the dictionary provided in the `partition` parameter. This can be achieved by iterating over the key-value pairs and formatting them correctly as key='value' pairs. Then, use this formatted string in the query to check for existing tables with partitions.

## Fix
In the corrected version, the partition string is constructed correctly by joining the key-value pairs from the partition dictionary with the appropriate formatting. This ensures that the partition information is properly included in the query.
