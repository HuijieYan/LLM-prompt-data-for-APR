The potential error in the buggy function `table_exists` is likely in the way the `stdout` variable is being checked for truthiness. The bug may arise due to the `stdout` variable not containing the expected output from the `run_hive_cmd` function, leading to incorrect evaluation in the condition checks.

To fix this bug, we need to handle potential issues in getting the output from `run_hive_cmd` correctly. We should check if the call to `run_hive_cmd` was successful and return the desired table existence result based on the response.

Here is a corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_description = self.partition_spec(partition)
            if not partition_description:
                return False
            
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_description))
        
            return stdout is not None

```

In this corrected version:
- We first check if the `partition_description` is obtained successfully. If not, the function returns `False` as the partition specification is incomplete or missing.
- We then check if the `stdout` returned from the second query contains any output. If it does, we assume the table exists and return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

By ensuring proper handling of the `stdout` and related variables, we can fix the bug in the `table_exists` function.
