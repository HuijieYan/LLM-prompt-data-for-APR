## Identified issues:
1. The run_hive_cmd function is being called inside the table_exists function, but it is not imported or referenced correctly within the function.
2. The usage of string formatting in the run_hive_cmd calls is not consistent or clear, which may cause errors in constructing the Hive commands.

## Bug explanation:
The bug in the table_exists function is caused by the incorrect way of calling the run_hive_cmd function, as it is not accessed properly within the class. Additionally, the string formatting used for constructing the Hive commands is not consistent, which can lead to errors in executing the queries.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Import the run_hive_cmd function properly within the HiveCommandClient class to have access to it.
2. Fix the formatting of the Hive commands to ensure that they are correctly constructed and executed.
3. Ensure that the partition parameter is handled correctly in both cases within the function.

## Corrected version of the table_exists function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = self.run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The run_hive_cmd function is accessed using `self.run_hive_cmd` to ensure the correct function call within the class.
2. The string formatting for constructing the Hive commands is updated for consistency and readability.
3. The return statement is simplified to directly return the boolean value of `stdout` to indicate whether the table exists.

These changes should address the bug and improve the functionality of the table_exists function.
