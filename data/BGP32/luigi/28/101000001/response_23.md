The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect format of the SQL query being used in the `run_hive_cmd` function call. The bug is located in the `else` block in the `table_exists` function where the SQL query being passed to `run_hive_cmd` is incorrect due to a formatting mistake.

The bug occurs because the query being passed to `run_hive_cmd` in the else block is not properly formatted. The call to `run_hive_cmd` is passing a query string with incorrect formatting, resulting in the SQL query not being properly executed in Hive. This leads to incorrect results being returned, causing the `table_exists` function to behave erroneously.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the formatting of the SQL query being passed to `run_hive_cmd` in the else block. We need to ensure that the query string is properly formatted with the correct placeholders for database, table, and partition. Additionally, we need to handle any potential errors that might occur during the execution of the SQL query.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            # Correctly format the SQL query string
            query = 'use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
    
            return stdout is not None
```

In this corrected version, I have fixed the formatting of the SQL query being passed to `run_hive_cmd` in the else block. The query now includes placeholders for database, table, and partition, ensuring that the SQL query is correctly executed in Hive. I have also handled the return value properly by checking if `stdout` is not None, which indicates that the table exists.
