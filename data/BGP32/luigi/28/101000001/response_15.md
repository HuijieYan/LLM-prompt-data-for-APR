## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` is trying to check if a table exists in a given Hive database. It uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands and parse the output to determine the existence of the table.

## Identified Issue:
The issue in the buggy function lies in the way the query is constructed for checking table existence. In the case where a partition is provided, the query is not properly formatted, leading to incorrect results.

## Cause of Bug:
When a partition is provided, the query constructed in the `table_exists` function is missing some of the necessary elements. The issue arises from how the command is built using string formatting and concatenation.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Hive command query is correctly constructed, especially when dealing with partitions. Properly format the query string to include all required components for listing partitions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected version, the query string construction for checking table existence with a partition is fixed. The `table_exists` function now correctly includes the necessary components in the Hive command query. Additionally, the use of boolean conversion `(bool(stdout))` simplifies the return statement and ensures consistency.
