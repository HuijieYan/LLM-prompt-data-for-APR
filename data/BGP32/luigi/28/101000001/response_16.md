## Analysis:
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is checking for the existence of a table in a database in Hive. It calls the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute Hive commands. The bug seems to be related to how the Hive commands are constructed and executed.

## Identified Issue:
The issue in the `table_exists` function lies in how the Hive command is being constructed in the `else` block where partition information is provided.

## Bug Explanation:
In the `else` block of the `table_exists` function, the Hive command being constructed seems to be incorrect. The partition specification is passed as an argument to `show partitions` in a way that may not be valid, which can lead to incorrect results or failure to determine table existence properly.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, improve the construction of the Hive command string in the `else` block to correctly include the partition specification. Ensure that the Hive command constructed is valid and follows the syntax expected by Hive to retrieve partition information.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        partition_clause = ", ".join(["{0}='{1}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_clause))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version, the `partition_clause` is constructed based on the partition dictionary passed to the function. This ensures that the partition information is correctly formatted in the Hive command for checking table existence with partitions.
