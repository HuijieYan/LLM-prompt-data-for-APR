## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function `run_hive_cmd` is called inside the `table_exists` function but is not imported or referenced within the function itself.
2. The formatting of the SQL query within the `run_hive_cmd` function call may cause syntax errors or incorrect query execution.
3. The use of `%s` within the SQL query string may result in incorrect string interpolation.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `table_exists` function is primarily due to the incorrect usage of string formatting and passing partition specifications to the `run_hive_cmd` function. The way the SQL queries are constructed can lead to syntax errors or improper execution. Additionally, not handling the import of the `run_hive_cmd` function could cause a NameError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure the `run_hive_cmd` function is imported or referenced within the buggy function `table_exists`.
2. Correctly format the SQL queries to avoid syntax errors and properly pass partition specifications.
3. Use proper string interpolation methods to construct SQL queries dynamically.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The required import for the run_hive_cmd function
from luigi.contrib.hive import run_hive_cmd

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the table_exists function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec_str = ','.join([f"{k}='{v}'" for k, v in partition.items()])
            query = """USE {0}; SHOW PARTITIONS {1} PARTITION ({2});""".format(database, table, partition_spec_str)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(query)
    
            return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version, we have imported the `run_hive_cmd` function, fixed the SQL query construction for partition specifications, and ensured proper handling of the function calls within the `table_exists` function.
