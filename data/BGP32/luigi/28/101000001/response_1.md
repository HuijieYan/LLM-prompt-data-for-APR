The bug in the provided function `table_exists` is in the formatting of the query string when `partition` is not None. The formatting is incorrect, leading to incorrect use of placeholders and not providing the expected query to check if the table exists.

To fix the bug:
1. Correctly format the query string when `partition` is not None.
2. Ensure that the placeholders are appropriately positioned and filled with the necessary values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_str = ", ".join(["{}='{}'".format(k, v) for k, v in partition.items()])
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, partition_str))
            return bool(stdout)  

``` 

The corrected function now properly formats the query string when the `partition` is not None by building a string representation of the partition values and inserting it into the query.
