## Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the way the `run_hive_cmd` function is being called and how the query is constructed. In the case where a partition is provided, the query is not being correctly formatted, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when calling `run_hive_cmd` with the query to check if a table exists with a specific partition. The construction of the query is incorrect, leading to potential syntax errors.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the query for checking table existence with partition is constructed correctly.
2. Use the appropriate syntax for forming the query.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, the syntax for constructing the query when checking for table existence with a specific partition is fixed, ensuring that the correct query is executed.
