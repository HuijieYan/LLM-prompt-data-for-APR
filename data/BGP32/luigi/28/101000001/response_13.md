## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    
```

## Bug analysis, explanation, and correction strategy:

### Bug:
The bug in the original function `table_exists` arises from the incorrect usage of string formatting on the query to be executed for checking table existence with partitions. The buggy line:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
```
Incorrectly uses the `%` string formatting operator, leading to a potential error when formatting the query string.

### Explanation:
The `%` operator used for string formatting can be error-prone, especially when handling multiple variables. In this case, the incorrect usage resulted in the query string not being formatted correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors when executing the Hive command.

### Correction strategy:
To fix the bug, the string formatting should be done using the `.format()` method, which is more robust and less error-prone compared to the `%` operator. By using `.format()` method, we can ensure that the query string is correctly formatted with the provided variables.

### Correction:
In the corrected version of the function provided above, I have replaced the buggy line with the correct usage of `.format()` method for string formatting. This correction ensures that the query string for checking table existence with partitions is formatted properly, reducing the chances of errors during execution.
