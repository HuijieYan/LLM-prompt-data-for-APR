### Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement where the function checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. Depending on the format of the `stdout` variable, the check might not be accurate, leading to incorrect return values.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. In some cases, the `stdout` variable may contain additional information along with the table name, causing the function to incorrectly evaluate whether the table exists or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to accurately check for the existence of the table name in the `stdout` variable. We can split the `stdout` variable by newline characters and then check if the table name is present in any of the lines to ensure an accurate result.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')

            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            return any(partition in partitions for partition in partitions)
```

By splitting the `stdout` variable and checking each line separately, we ensure a more accurate evaluation of whether the table exists or not. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
