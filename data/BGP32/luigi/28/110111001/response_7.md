### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the comparison of the `table` with the `stdout`. The function checks if the `table` is in `stdout`, but the comparison is done in a case-sensitive manner. This causes the tests to fail when the table names are provided in different cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` and `stdout` is case-insensitive. This can be achieved by converting both strings to lowercase before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: luigi/contrib/hive.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # Corrected version of the previous buggy function
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By incorporating case-insensitive comparisons, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
