### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition for checking if a table exists in the database. The function returns `True` when the table is found in the `stdout` output from the hive command, but it should return `False` if the table is not found. This logic is flipped in the function implementation.

In Case 1 and Case 3, the function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False`. This is due to the incorrect logic where it should return `False` if the table is not found in the `stdout`.

In Case 2 and Case 4, the function correctly returns `True` when the table is found in the `stdout`. However, it fails the test because the test expects the result to be `True` when the table is not found. This is also due to the incorrect logic where the function should return `False` if the table is not found in the `stdout`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to correct the logic where it checks for the presence of the table in the `stdout`. The function should return `True` if the table is found and `False` if the table is not found in the `stdout`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return stdout
``` 

By fixing the condition to return `False` when the table is not found in stdout, the corrected function now should pass the failing tests.
