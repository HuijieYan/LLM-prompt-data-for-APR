### Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is designed to check if a given table exists in a specified database in Hive. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to execute commands in Hive and determine the existence of the table.

The bug in the function seems to be related to how the function checks the presence of the table in the output of the Hive command.

### Issues
1. When checking for the existence of the table, the function only checks if the table name is in the output string, without considering other potential outputs or formats that may include the table name.
2. In the else statement, the function is trying to show partitions based on the provided partition information, but it is comparing the entire output string to determine the existence of the table, which is incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `table_exists` function does not handle the Hive command output correctly. It assumes a specific format of the output string, leading to incorrect evaluations and failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to parse the output of the Hive command more accurately to check for table existence.
2. Ensure that the function accounts for different variations in the output format, especially when dealing with partitions.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables in {1};'.format(database, table))
            
            # Check if the table name exists in the output
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            
            # Check if any partitions exist for the specified table
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Summary
The corrected implementation now properly checks for the existence of the table by parsing the output of the Hive command. It also handles partition information correctly when determining the existence of the table. These changes should address the issues identified in the original code and allow the failing test cases to pass.
