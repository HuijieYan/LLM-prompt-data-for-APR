### Identified issues:
1. The logic in the `table_exists` function is inconsistent with how it checks for the existence of a table based on the `stdout` returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function.
2. The function should check if the table name is in `stdout` for the case when a partition is not specified, but the current implementation only checks for the existence of `stdout`.
3. For the case when a partition is specified, the function should check if the partition specification is in `stdout`, but the current implementation only checks for the existence of `stdout`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent logic used to check for the existence of a table based on the output returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The current implementation does not handle both scenarios correctly, leading to failing tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the `table_exists` function to properly check if the table name or partition specification is in the `stdout` returned from `run_hive_cmd`.
2. Modify the function to return `True` if the table or partition is found in the `stdout`, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return self.partition_spec(partition) in stdout
``` 

By updating the logic in the `table_exists` function to correctly check for the presence of the table name or partition specification in the `stdout` and return `True` accordingly, we ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
