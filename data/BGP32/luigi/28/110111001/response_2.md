### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic used to check if a table exists. The function currently checks for the presence of the table name in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. However, this check is not reliable as the table name might exist as part of another string in the output.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test cases, the function fails because even though the table name exists in the output of `run_hive_cmd`, it is not being correctly identified by the function due to incorrect substrings that match the table name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how we check for the existence of the table in the output of `run_hive_cmd`. Instead of a simple substring match, we should split the output into lines and then check if any line exactly matches the table name.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return any(line.strip() == table for line in stdout.split('\n'))
```

By using the `split('\n')` method to separate the lines in the output and then checking if any line exactly matches the table name, we ensure a more accurate check for the existence of the table. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
