### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to the comparison logic in the `if` condition. The function checks if the `stdout` variable is not empty and then if the `table` is in `stdout`. However, the condition should be reversed to check if the `table` is in `stdout` and then if `stdout` is not empty.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional statements in the function to ensure that the correct logic is applied for checking if a table exists in the output of the command.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

By correcting the condition to `return stdout and table in stdout` in both branches of the `if` statement, we ensure that the function correctly validates if the table exists in the output of the command.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and the `AssertionError: False is not true` issue should be resolved.
