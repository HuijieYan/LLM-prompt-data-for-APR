### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition check for the presence of the table in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug manifests when the table name is detected in the output, causing the function to return `False` instead of `True` as expected.

The buggy function incorrectly handles the condition in the `if stdout` block. It checks if `stdout` (the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function) exists, but fails to correctly evaluate if the table name is present in the output.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test cases, when the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function contains the requested table name, the buggy function incorrectly returns `False` instead of the expected `True`. This discrepancy results in the test failures with the AssertionError stating that "False is not true."

The bug arises from the misuse of the condition check with the `and` operator in the first condition block of the function, where it should return `True` if the table exists in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `table_exists` function, we need to correct the condition check to determine if the table exists in the output of the `run_hive_cmd` function. The modified condition should accurately assess the presence of the table name in the `stdout` variable and return `True` in that case.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout  # Check if table name is in the output
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)  # Return True if stdout has content, indicating table existence
```

By fixing the condition check for the presence of the table name in the output from `run_hive_cmd`, the corrected `table_exists` function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.
