### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `table_exists`, the bug arises due to how the `stdout` variable is checked for the existence of the table. In the first `if` block, if the `stdout` is not empty, the function checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` using `table in stdout`. However, in the second `else` block, the function only checks if `stdout` is not empty to return `True`, but it should be checking if the `table` is in the `stdout` just like in the first `if` block. This inconsistency causes the function to return incorrect results and fail the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` for both cases (partition is None and partition is not None). This involves modifying the `else` block to check for the existence of the `table` in the `stdout` just like in the first `if` block. By making this change, the function will return the expected results and pass the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

After implementing the correction, the function now consistently checks if the `table` exists in the `stdout` before returning the result, fixing the bug and ensuring the correct behavior of the function.
