### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class checks if a table exists in the specified database using Hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is checking for the existence of the table in the `stdout` variable.
3. The failing test is asserting that the table exists when it shouldn't and vice versa. This indicates a logic error in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly evaluates the `stdout` variable to determine the existence of the table.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The current implementation checks if the table name is present in the `stdout` variable directly, which may lead to false positives due to partial matches. We should modify the function to perform a more precise check.
2. We will split the `stdout` variable by line and trim any whitespace to match the table name exactly.
3. Modify the `table_exists` function to return `True` only if the exact table name is found in the `stdout` variable after splitting it by lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in [t.strip() for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip()]
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                  (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

```

By making the adjustment to split the `stdout` variable by lines and trim any whitespace, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
