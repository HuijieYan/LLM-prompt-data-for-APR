### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic when checking if the table exists in the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks for the exact string match with the table name, which can lead to incorrect results due to extra newline characters in the stdout. This discrepancy causes the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison check to handle cases where the table name may have extra characters like newlines. We can use a more robust approach such as checking if the table name appears in the list of tables retrieved from stdout, instead of checking for an exact match.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table in stdout.split()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the stdout by newline characters (`stdout.split()`), we can check if the `table` exists in the list of tables returned, handling cases where extra characters like newlines cause issues. This correction should resolve the failing test cases.
