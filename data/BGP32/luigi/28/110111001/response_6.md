The bug in the `table_exists` function occurs because the comparison `table in stdout` in the first part of the function is expecting an exact match of the table name in the output, but in reality, it should check for the existence of the table name in the output. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison in the first part of the function to check for existence rather than exact match.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return stdout and any(table in line for line in stdout.split('\n'))
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
