### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the logic of checking if a table exists in the Hive database. The function is returning the boolean result based on the existence of the table string in the stdout from the Hive command. However, this comparison is not taking into account any potential formatting issues like extra spaces or newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the table name in the stdout is accurate. One approach is to split the stdout by newline characters and then check if any of the resulting strings match the table name.

### Corrected Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return any(t.strip() == table for t in stdout.split('\n') if t.strip())
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By using the updated `table_exists` function that splits the stdout by newlines and checks for an exact match with the table name after stripping spaces, the function should now correctly identify whether the table exists in the database. This should address the bug and make the failing tests pass.
