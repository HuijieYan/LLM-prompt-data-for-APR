### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the condition to determine whether a table exists or not. The current implementation checks for the presence of the table name in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function and returns `True` if found, otherwise `False`. However, the bug arises due to incorrect handling of the stdout response from `run_hive_cmd` in cases where the table name may be a substring of another table's name.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the output from `run_hive_cmd` to ensure that the match is exact and not just based on substring presence. This can be achieved by splitting the stdout by newline characters and then checking if the exact table name exists in the list of tables obtained from the split.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table in stdout.split('\n')
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By making the modification to split the stdout by newline characters and then performing the table name check, we ensure an exact match is found, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
