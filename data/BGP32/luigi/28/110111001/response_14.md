### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison of the `table` variable with the output stored in `stdout`. The function incorrectly checks if the table name is in the output without considering case sensitivity, leading to false negatives in the test cases where the table name is in a different case than the one provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output is case insensitive. By converting both the table name and the output to lowercase (or uppercase) before comparison, we can make the function correctly identify the table's existence regardless of the case.

### Corrected Version
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
``` 

In the corrected version, both `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before the comparison, ensuring the check is case-insensitive. This modification should resolve the issue of false negatives in the test cases.
