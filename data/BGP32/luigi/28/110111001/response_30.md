### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the comparison logic that determines whether a table exists based on the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function checks if the table name is in the output from `run_hive_cmd` and returns `True` if found, otherwise `False`.

However, in the current implementation, the function fails to correctly handle the case where the table name is a subset of another table name in the output. For example, when checking for the table "mytable" and the output contains "mytable1", the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly matches the table name in the command output. One way to achieve this is by splitting the output by newline characters and then checking for an exact match of the table name in the resulting list of table names.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            tables_list = stdout.split('\n')
            return table in tables_list
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By splitting the `stdout` output by newline characters and checking for exact matches of the table name, we can ensure that the function correctly determines the existence of a table. This corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
