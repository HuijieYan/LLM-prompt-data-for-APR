The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the incorrect comparison in the `if stdout:` block. The function is checking if `stdout` is not empty to return `True`, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The function should check if the table name exists in the output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison in the `if stdout:` block to check if the table name is present in the output `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return table in stdout
```

By making this change, the function will correctly check if the table name is present in the output, ensuring the function behaves as expected in the provided test cases.
