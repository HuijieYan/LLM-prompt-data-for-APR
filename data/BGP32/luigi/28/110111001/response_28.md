### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is failing the test cases because it is incorrectly checking for the presence of the table name in the output obtained from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The function is not handling the case sensitivity properly, leading to false results.

In the failing test cases:
- For Case 2 and Case 4, the function should return true because the table name is present in the output, but due to case sensitivity, it incorrectly returns false.
- For all cases, the logic for checking whether the table exists in the `stdout` variable is incorrect, leading to the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class to properly handle the case sensitivity of the table names. We should also correct the logic for checking if the table exists in the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the table name and the output to lower case before comparison, we ensure that case sensitivity does not affect the check for table existence.
