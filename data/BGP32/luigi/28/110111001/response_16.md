### Explanation:
The bug in the `table_exists` function lies in the conditional check for the presence of the table in the output `stdout`. The function checks if the table name is in the `stdout` directly, but this check is incorrect as it does not handle cases where the table name might be part of another string in the `stdout`. 

Looking at the failing test cases and runtime values, we can see that the function fails to correctly identify the existence of the table due to the direct string comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check by splitting the `stdout` into lines and then checking each line for the presence of the table name. This way, we can accurately determine if the table exists based on each line's content rather than the whole `stdout` string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return any(table == line.strip() for line in stdout.split('\n'))
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By splitting the `stdout` into lines and checking each line individually, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
