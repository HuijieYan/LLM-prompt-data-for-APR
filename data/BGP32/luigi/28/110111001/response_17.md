The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from how the return value is being checked. In the current implementation, the function returns a boolean value based on whether the `stdout` variable is empty or not. However, in the failing tests, the expected behavior is to check if the `table` exists in the `stdout`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
        if stdout:
            return table in stdout
        else:
            return False
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly check if the `table` exists in the `stdout` output instead of just checking if the `stdout` is empty. This fix should address the failing tests and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
