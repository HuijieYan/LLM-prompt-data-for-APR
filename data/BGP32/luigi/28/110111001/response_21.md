## Bugs and Issues Analysis
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is expected to check if a table exists in a given database. It retrieves the output of a `run_hive_cmd` function call, which should return either the list of tables or partitions based on the input parameters.
2. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the stdout response from the `run_hive_cmd` call. It checks for the presence of the table name in stdout, but in some cases, the stdout contains additional information (like partition details) which causes the check to fail.
3. The failing tests show that the function fails in scenarios where the stdout contains more than just the table names. In those cases, the function should still return `True` if the table name is present in the stdout, even if additional information exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function logic to properly handle scenarios where the stdout contains extra information beyond just the table names. We should adjust the check to confirm the existence of the table name within the returned information.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            return stdout and table in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show tables like "%s" partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return stdout and table in stdout
``` 

By making the suggested changes, the `table_exists` function specifically looks for the table name within the stdout output, allowing it to handle scenarios where additional information is present. This modification should address the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
