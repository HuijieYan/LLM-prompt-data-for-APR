### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database using Hive. The issue reported on GitHub mentions that this function is not case insensitive, leading to test failures when checking tables with different case variations.
2. The bug seems to be in the comparison of the table names in the `stdout` without considering case sensitivity.
3. The bug occurs because the comparison `table in stdout` does not take into account the case sensitivity of the table names. As a result, when the table name case does not match exactly in `stdout`, the function returns incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make `table_exists` function case insensitive by converting both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison.
5. Let's correct the bug in the `table_exists` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

The corrected version converts both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, making the function case insensitive. This change ensures that the function returns the correct results even if the case of the table names varies.

The updated function should now pass all the test cases mentioned earlier and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding table name case sensitivity in the `table_exists` function.
