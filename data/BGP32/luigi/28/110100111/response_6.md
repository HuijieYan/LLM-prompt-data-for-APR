### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test, expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue:

- The buggy function is the `table_exists` method inside the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module.
- The failing test case checks the behavior of the `table_exists` method with different scenarios, including table names with different cases and partition specifications.
- The expected input/output values in the failing test cases involve checking if a table exists in a specified database and whether a partition exists for that table.
- The GitHub issue highlights the problem of case sensitivity in table existence checks and suggests a fix by making the check case insensitive.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:

- The bug might be present in the comparison of the `table` with the `stdout` value, which could lead to case sensitivity issues.
- The bug could also be related to the handling of partitions in the `else` block of the function.

### Explanation of the bug:

The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from a case sensitivity issue when checking if a table exists in the specified database. The function directly compares the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case differences. This results in the function sometimes failing to detect the existence of a table due to case mismatches.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug and address the case sensitivity issue mentioned in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the function to compare the lowercase version of the table name with the lowercase version of the output from the Hive command. This way, the comparison will be case insensitive, ensuring that the function correctly detects the existence of a table regardless of case.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, we convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison, making the check case insensitive. This adjustment aligns with the fix suggested in the GitHub issue to address the case sensitivity problem in table existence checks.
