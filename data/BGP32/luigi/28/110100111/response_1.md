### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute Hive commands and return the output.
2. The bug occurs because the function does not handle case sensitivity when comparing the table names obtained from the Hive commands with the input table name.
3. The failing test checks the behavior of the function for different scenarios, including case sensitivity. The function fails to return the correct results when comparing table names in different cases, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the table names retrieved from Hive commands and the input table name are compared in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function will include lowercasing the table names before comparison to address the case sensitivity issue.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

Now, the `table_exists` function will compare table names in a case-insensitive manner by converting both to lowercase before checking for existence. This update addresses the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.
