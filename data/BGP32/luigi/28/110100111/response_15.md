### Analyzing the buggy function and the related GitHub issue

1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute Hive commands and check the output for table existence.

2. The GitHub issue titled "hive table_exists should be case insensitive" highlights the problem where tables with different case conventions (capitalized vs. lowercase) may cause the function to fail. The issue proposes making the `table_exists` function case insensitive by checking the output against the lowercase version of the table name.

### Identifying potential error locations in the buggy function

1. The first potential error lies in how the function compares the table name with the stdout output. It only checks if the table name is in the stdout as is, which may lead to case sensitivity issues.

2. The second potential error is the comparison of partition information in the else block. The comparison may not be functioning correctly due to formatting or other issues.

### Cause of the bug

The bug arises from the function `table_exists` not being case insensitive when checking if a table exists. If a table name is in a different case convention than what is returned by Hive, the function may fail to correctly identify the table's existence.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function should convert both the table name and the stdout output to lowercase before comparison. This way, any case discrepancies will be resolved, and the function will become case insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the `table_exists` function

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return True if stdout else False
```

In the corrected version:
- The table name and stdout output are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison.
- The comparison in the else block has been modified for clarity and correctness.
- The function should now be case insensitive when checking for table existence.

By making these changes, the `table_exists` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values as outlined earlier.
