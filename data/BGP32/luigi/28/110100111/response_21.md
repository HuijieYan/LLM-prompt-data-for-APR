### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to check if a table exists in a specified database. The issue lies in comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function without considering case sensitivity.
2. The bug arises when the table name casing does not match the casing of the table name in the output from the `run_hive_cmd`.
3. The failing test cases in `hive_test.py` demonstrate scenarios where the casing of the table name causes the function to return incorrect results. The expected behavior is to make the comparison case-insensitive to match the case-insensitive nature of Hive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` is case-insensitive.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected version:
- The comparison between `table` and `stdout` is made case-insensitive by using the `lower()` function on both strings before comparing.
- The use of `bool(stdout)` directly returns `True` if stdout is not empty (equivalent to `stdout is not None`).
- This corrected version addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and ensures correct behavior in handling table existence checks in Hive.
