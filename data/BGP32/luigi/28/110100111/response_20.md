### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of `luigi/contrib/hive.py` is designed to check if a table exists in a Hive database. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to run Hive commands and analyze the output to determine table existence.
2. The bug arises from the case sensitivity issue when comparing the table name in the output with the expected table name. The function does not handle case sensitivity correctly.
3. The failing test cases show that when comparing table names like `'mytable'` and `'MyTable'`, the function fails to recognize the table due to case sensitivity.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below. It converts both the table name and the output to lowercase for a case-insensitive comparison.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercase versions of the table name and the output, the `table_exists` function becomes case-insensitive and should now pass the failing test cases mentioned.
