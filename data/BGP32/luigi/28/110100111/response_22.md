### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking the existence of a table in a Hive database using `hive` invocations.
2. The bug seems to occur when comparing the table names with the stdout returned from the `run_hive_cmd` function. The bug relates to case sensitivity in table names.
3. The bug causes the test cases to fail when checking for table existence due to case mismatches between the table name and the stdout of the `run_hive_cmd` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to lower case before comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function will handle case insensitivity by converting the table name and the stdout to lower case before checking for table existence.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the table name and stdout to lower case before comparison.
2. Update the logic inside the function to use lower case comparisons to make it case insensitive.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                        (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By making the table name and the output of `run_hive_cmd` function lower case for comparison, the corrected version of the function should handle the case insensitivity issue and pass the failing test cases.
