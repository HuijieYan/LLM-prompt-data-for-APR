**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function is `table_exists` within the `HiveCommandClient` class, which uses `hive` invocations to find information about tables.
2. The function takes parameters `table`, `database`, and an optional `partition`.
3. The issue reported on GitHub (#896) mentions that the function should be case insensitive when checking table names.
4. The failing test cases provided in the test file `hive_test.py` cover various scenarios where the function fails to correctly determine table existence due to case sensitivity.

**Identified Bug:**

The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle case sensitivity when checking if a table exists. The function compares the table name directly to the stdout from the `hive` command without considering case differences.

**Bug Cause:**

The bug is caused by the direct comparison of the table name and the stdout without converting them to a common case, leading to issues when the table names have different cases.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**

To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the stdout to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. This will make the comparison case insensitive and address the reported issue on GitHub.

**Corrected Function:**

Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity when checking table names.

The corrected function aligns with the expected test cases' input/output values and resolves the reported GitHub issue (#896).
