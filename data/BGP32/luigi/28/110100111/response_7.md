### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in a database by running a Hive command.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity when comparing the table name in the returned output.
3. The failing test cases provided indicate that the function is sensitive to the case of the table name when checking for its existence.
4. The bug is due to a direct comparison of the table name without considering case sensitivity.
5. To fix this bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase or uppercase before comparison.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)"""
                                  % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, the function will be case-insensitive as desired. This will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function more robust.
