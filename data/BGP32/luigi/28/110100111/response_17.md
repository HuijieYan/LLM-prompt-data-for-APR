### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is supposed to check if a table exists in a given database with an optional partition.
2. The bug arises when comparing the table name with the output from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity, leading to test failures.
3. The function fails to account for case differences in table names, causing tests to fail when the table name doesn't match the case of the expected output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure case insensitivity in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command.
5. The corrected version of the function will include a case-insensitive comparison using lowercased values.

### Correction:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table.lower()}";')
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)});')
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercased values of the table name and the output from the Hive command in a case-insensitive manner, the corrected function addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

This correction ensures that the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class performs case-insensitive checks for table existence, allowing the function to pass the failing tests as described in the test scenarios.
