### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a given table exists in a specified database with optional partition specifications using hive commands.
2. The bug seems to be related to case sensitivity in comparing the table name obtained from the hive command output with the input table name.
3. The failing test cases reveal that the function is case sensitive in comparing table names causing the tests to fail when the cases do not match between actual and expected table names.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case insensitive while checking if the table name exists in the hive command output.
5. We should update the `table_exists` function to compare lowercase versions of both the input table name and the table names retrieved from hive command output.

### Bug Cause:
The existing implementation of the `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class does a direct comparison between the input `table` name and the table names retrieved from the `stdout` of hive commands. This comparison is case-sensitive, leading to failures in test cases when there is a mismatch in case between the input and output table names.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `table_exists` function to convert both the input `table` name and the table names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure that the comparison is done in a case-insensitive manner.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By converting both the input `table` name and the table names retrieved from `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
