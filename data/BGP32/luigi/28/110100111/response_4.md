### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is responsible for checking if a specific table exists in the given database. 
2. The function uses `run_hive_cmd` to execute different hive commands based on the presence of a partition. 
3. The bug arises because the function does not account for case insensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from `run_hive_cmd`, causing test failures.
4. To fix the bug, it is essential to make the comparison case insensitive by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison.
2. Update the function to handle case insensitivity effectively.
3. Implement the required changes to address the issue raised in GitHub.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)
```

### Justification:
1. The corrected function now converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison, ensuring case insensitivity.
2. The function now checks if the lowercase table name is present in the lowercase stdout to determine if the table exists.
3. The function returns `True` if stdout is not empty, indicating the success of the query.

By implementing the changes above, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and address the case sensitivity issue reported in the GitHub thread.
