### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a table exists in the database using Hive commands. The issue arises because the function does not account for case insensitivity in table names.
2. The potential error locations are in the comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command, which leads to failing test cases where the table name cases differ.
3. The bug occurs because the function directly compares the table name with the output from Hive without considering case differences. This causes the function to fail when the table name cases do not match. The failing test cases clearly demonstrate the issue by showing mismatches in expected and actual returns.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle case insensitivity. We can lowercase both the table name and the output from Hive before comparing them to ensure a consistent comparison regardless of the case.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to lowercase both the table name and the output from Hive, the corrected function addresses the case sensitivity issue and should now pass the failing test cases.
