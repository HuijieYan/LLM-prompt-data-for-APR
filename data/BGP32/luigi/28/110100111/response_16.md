### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is currently failing the test cases due to case sensitivity issues.
2. The bug is caused because the function does not handle case insensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. The failing test cases are failing because the function does not handle case-insensitive table names correctly, leading to incorrect comparisons.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner.
5. The corrected version of the function will use lower case conversion for both the table name and the stdout to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show tables like "{table}";')
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(f'use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})')
    
            return bool(stdout)
```

After applying the fix, the `table_exists` function should now correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons when checking for table existence. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the issue raised in GitHub.
