The bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the case sensitivity behavior when comparing the `table` parameter with the `stdout` output. The bug occurs because the comparison does not take into account the case of the table name when checking for existence in the `stdout`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the `table` name and the tables in `stdout` is case insensitive. One way to achieve this is by converting both strings to lowercase before comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and the tables in `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, we make the check case insensitive and ensure that the function behaves as expected.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue described in the GitHub report.
