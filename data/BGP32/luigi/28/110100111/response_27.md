### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function in the `HiveCommandClient` class is supposed to check if a table exists in Hive by running a command and examining the output. The function appears to have a bug related to case sensitivity when comparing table names.
2. The bug is likely located in the comparison logic where it checks if the table name is in the output of the command.
3. The bug causes the function to fail in scenarios where the table name casing doesn't match exactly with the output in a case-sensitive manner. The expected output should be insensitive to the casing of the table name, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to make it case-insensitive while checking if the table exists.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))  # Change here
    
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Change here
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
    
            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

The modifications include converting the `table` parameter to lowercase before running the command and also converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase during the comparison to make it case-insensitive.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue related to case insensitivity in table name comparisons mentioned in GitHub.
