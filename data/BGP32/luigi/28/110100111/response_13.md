### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class is used to determine whether a table exists in the Hive database. 
2. The bug in the function is related to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
3. The issue arises when the function checks if the table name is in the output from the command, without considering case sensitivity. This leads to test failures when the table names are provided in different cases than expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to convert both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparing them to ensure case insensitivity.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the function

class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

By converting both the `table` and `stdout` values to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function now correctly handles the case-insensitivity issue reported in the GitHub issue.

The corrected function should now pass all the test cases provided.
