### Analysis:
1. The `table_exists` function inside the `HiveCommandClient` class is meant to check if a table exists in a Hive database.
2. The bug occurs when the function checks for the existence of a table using case-sensitive comparison, causing test failures due to the case mismatch.
3. The bug originates from comparing the `table` variable directly with the `stdout` received from the Hive command without normalizing the case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive by converting both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before the comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug surfaces due to case sensitivity when comparing the table name `table` with the output `stdout` from the Hive command.

### Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to convert both the `table` name and the `stdout` output to lowercase before comparing for table existence.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use %s; show partitions %s partition(%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By normalizing both `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, the corrected function ensures case insensitivity in checking table existence.
