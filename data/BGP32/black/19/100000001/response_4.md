## Analysis:
This function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the empty lines in the code based on certain conditions. The function is responsible for determining how many empty lines should be added before the current line based on various factors like indentation depth, line type, etc.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. In the while loop, the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` seems incorrect. The assignment should be `before = 1 if depth else 2` to ensure proper handling of empty lines.
2. In the conditions for determining newlines, there seems to be a misconception regarding the number of empty lines to be added.
3. In the condition `if current_line.is_flow_control`, the return values don't seem to align with the function's purpose.
4. There is a confusion in the condition related to `is_import` and `is_yield`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in this function mainly stems from incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to be added in different scenarios. Additionally, some conditions were not properly aligned with the intended behavior of the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the assignment in the while loop to `before = 1 if depth else 2`.
2. Rewrite the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to ensure the correct behavior is exhibited in each situation.
3. Revise the conditions based on `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to capture the correct scenarios.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth > 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.is_yield and depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the issues and errors identified in the original function have been addressed. The logic for adding empty lines has been revised to align with the expected behavior in different code scenarios.
