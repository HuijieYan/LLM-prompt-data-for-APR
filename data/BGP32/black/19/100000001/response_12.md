The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to add before the current line. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of `before` variable.
2. Misinterpretation of conditions for adding empty lines.
3. Incorrect handling of previous definitions and decorators.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to add before the current line. The `before` variable is not updated correctly in certain conditions, leading to incorrect empty line insertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated properly based on relevant conditions.
2. Verify the logic for adding empty lines before the current line.
3. Double-check the handling of previous definitions and decorators to prevent incorrect empty line insertion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines before decorators.
        return 0, 0
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now correctly determines the number of empty lines to add before the current line based on the specified conditions.
