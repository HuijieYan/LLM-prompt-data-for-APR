### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The function evaluates various conditions such as depth, presence of leaves, decorators, definitions, flow control statements, imports, and yields to decide the number of empty lines.

### Bugs:
1. In the while loop, the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` within the loop updates the `before` variable instead of the intended `newlines` variable.
2. The condition `if current_line.depth: newlines -= 1` does not update the `newlines` variable correctly.

### Bug Causes:
1. The incorrect assignment of the value in the while loop leads to the incorrect adjustment of empty lines.
2. The condition `if current_line.depth: newlines -= 1` should decrease `newlines` by 1 if the `current_line.depth` is non-zero, but the implementation is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the assignment in the while loop to update `newlines` correctly based on the `depth`.
2. Adjust the conditional logic to correctly adjust `newlines` based on the `current_line.depth`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
