### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line in a code block. The function checks various conditions related to the type of the current line and the previous line to decide the number of empty lines to insert.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` could cause an infinite loop if the `self.previous_defs` list is not updated correctly.
2. The return inside the if condition for decorators might not allow the subsequent checks to be executed if the previous line is a decorator.

### Bug explanation:
The bug in the function could be related to the incorrect handling of conditions and the inconsistency of updating the `before` variable based on different conditions. There appears to be inconsistency in determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line based on the line type and the depth of the current line.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition inside the while loop and ensure that the list `self.previous_defs` is correctly updated to prevent an infinite loop.
2. Adjust the return statements based on the conditions to ensure that all necessary checks are executed.
3. Review the logic of updating the `before` variable to make it consistent across different conditions.

### Corrected version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and 
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions are updated to ensure consistent checks and logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line in a code block.
