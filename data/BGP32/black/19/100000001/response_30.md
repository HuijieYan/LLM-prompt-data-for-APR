### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that should be added before a given `current_line` in the context of formatting code. The function performs checks based on various conditions and returns the appropriate number of empty lines to be inserted.

### Potential error locations:
1. The logic within the while loop might be incorrect. It pops elements from `self.previous_defs` based on a condition involving `depth` and sets `before` to 1 if depth is Truthy. This might not be the correct approach.
2. The condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` seems to be a key point for determining the number of newlines to insert. There might be an issue in this section if the logic is not evaluating the conditions correctly.
3. The condition for handling flow control statements (`if current_line.is_flow_control`) should be verified to ensure it correctly determines the number of empty lines.
4. The conditions involving checking previous lines for imports and yields may need to be adjusted to accurately calculate the number of empty lines.

### Bug cause:
The bug in this function may stem from incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert based on various conditions related to the `current_line`, its relationship with the previous line, and specific characteristics of the `current_line`.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Review the conditions where `before` is set to ensure it aligns with the desired behavior.
2. Carefully evaluate the conditions for setting the number of newlines before and after the `current_line`.
3. Check the flow control, imports, and yields checking conditions for accuracy.

### Corrected version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines_before = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines_before -= 1
        newlines_after = 0

        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the issues in the while loop, setting newlines before and after decorators, calculating the newlines before the flow control, imports, and yields conditions are addressed to prevent the buggy behavior observed in the original function.
