The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect logic flow in determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The main issue is with the calculation of the `newlines` variable where it always defaults to 2 and then subtracts if `current_line.depth` is truthy. This approach is not accurately determining the correct number of newlines to insert.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on specific conditions. We also need to handle the cases where no empty lines should be inserted based on the context of the current and previous lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 0  # Reset newlines count

        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines += 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The `newlines` count is properly reset and adjusted based on the conditions specified in the function.
- The logic for inserting empty lines before the current line is updated to reflect the correct number of newlines to insert based on different scenarios.
- The blocking conditions for inserting empty lines are maintained.
