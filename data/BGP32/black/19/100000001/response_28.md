There are a few potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The variable `before` is being reassigned multiple times without proper handling, which may lead to incorrect behavior.
2. The condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` is not clear and may not produce the desired result.
3. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line needs to be reviewed and possibly revised.
4. The handling of different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yields) may not be accurately accounted for in determining the line spacing.

To fix the bugs in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, we can apply the following corrections:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the variable `before` is consistently handled, and the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line has been revised. The handling of different types of lines, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, has also been updated for more accurate spacing.
