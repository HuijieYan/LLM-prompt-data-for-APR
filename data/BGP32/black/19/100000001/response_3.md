### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of empty lines to be added before the current line in some specific scenarios. The function receives a `current_line` object and calculates the appropriate number of empty lines based on certain conditions involving the properties of the `current_line` and the `previous_line`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculating the `before` variable might be adjusted incorrectly in the loop.
2. The conditions involving `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class` might not be evaluated correctly.
3. The handling of `newlines` might not consider all scenarios accurately.
4. The conditions for checking flow control, import lines, and yield lines could be causing issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect manipulation of the `before` variable and flawed conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the attributes of the current and previous lines.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reassess the calculation and usage of the `before` variable.
2. Ensure that the conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yield lines are properly handled.
3. Review the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in different scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return 0, 0  # Adjusted to return 0, 0 in default case
```

In this corrected version:
- The default return value for lines not covered by specific scenarios is set to `(0, 0)`.
- Other parts of the code are kept intact as they appear to correctly handle different scenarios involving decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc.
