The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` originates from the incorrect logic in handling the `before` variable. The issue lies in the specific condition where `before` is re-assigned in the `while` loop inside the function.

Here is a strategy to address the bug:
- Initially, set `before` to 0.
- If the condition `current_line.depth == 0` is met, update `max_allowed` to 2 (as seen in the original code).
- In the `while` loop, instead of re-assigning `before` unconditionally, add a counter to keep track of newlines and only update `before` if it's equal to 0. Otherwise, leave it unchanged.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    newline_counter = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        newline_counter += 1
    if before == 0:
        before = newline_counter if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version should address the bug by handling the `before` variable correctly based on the condition within the `while` loop.
