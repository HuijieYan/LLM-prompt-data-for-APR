### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line of code based on various conditions. The function uses if-else statements to check different scenarios and returns the appropriate values. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The assignment of `before` variable multiple times without cumulative effect.
2. Incorrect evaluation of conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the inconsistency in updating the `before` variable. The `before` variable is overwritten in multiple places where it should be accumulating the value instead.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable accumulates the values correctly at each condition check instead of being reassigned. This can be achieved by properly updating the `before` variable based on the conditions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if depth:
        before = 1
    else:
        before = 2 if before else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before or 0, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions specified in the function. The accumulation of `before` values is adjusted to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted before each line of code according to the given conditions.
