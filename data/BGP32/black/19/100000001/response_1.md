The potential error locations within the buggy function are as follows:
1. In the while loop, the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` seems to be incorrect as it is affecting the value of `before` based on the truthiness of `depth`.
2. The logic for determining the number of newlines to return at the end of the function needs to be revisited to ensure correctness.
3. There might be an issue with how the previous line attributes are being checked before returning the number of newlines.

The buggy function is intended to handle the case of empty lines in Python code formatting. It checks the depth and attributes of the current line to determine the number of newlines to be inserted before it. However, there are several issues in the logic that need to be addressed to fix the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the while loop condition to correctly set the value of `before` based on the condition `depth == 0`. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of newlines to return at the end of the function needs to be revised to handle different cases accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` within the while loop has been modified to `before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2` to ensure the correct assignment of values. The overall logic for determining the number of newlines to return has been revised to handle different scenarios accurately and avoid the bug in the original function.
