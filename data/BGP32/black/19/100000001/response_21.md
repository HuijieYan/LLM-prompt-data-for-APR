### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes a `current_line` object as input and calculates the number of empty lines needed before the current line.
2. There are conditional statements based on properties of the `current_line` object to determine the number of empty lines.
3. The bug may arise from the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines before the current line.
4. The issue seems to be related to how `before` and `depth` are updated and used in the code.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic where `before` is being redefined inconsistently in different conditions, leading to incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed before the current line.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that `before` is updated consistently throughout the function based on the specific conditions.
2. Verify that the value of `before` makes logical sense given the context of the conditionals.
3. Check if `depth` is used correctly to control the number of empty lines to be added.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the reassignment of `before` within the `while` loop has been adjusted to correctly handle the logic based on the depth condition. This modification ensures that `before` is updated consistently throughout the function.
