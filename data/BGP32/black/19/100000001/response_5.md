### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of empty lines before the current line. It checks various conditions related to indentation, decorators, flow control statements, imports, yield statements, etc., and returns the appropriate number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `before` within the `while` loop might be incorrect as it sets to `1` if `depth` is truthy.
2. The condition for determining the number of empty lines before the current line may not cover all scenarios correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug could occur due to incorrect handling of indentation levels in the while loop that specifies the number of empty lines before the current line. Additionally, there may be missing or incorrect conditions in the return statements.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that `before` is correctly calculated within the while loop for updating the number of empty lines.
2. Carefully review the conditions for each return statement and ensure all relevant scenarios are covered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `before` in the while loop is updated correctly based on the condition `depth == 0`. Additionally, the conditions in the return statements have been reviewed to cover all necessary scenarios.
