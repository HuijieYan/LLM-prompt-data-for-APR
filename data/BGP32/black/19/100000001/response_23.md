## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line being processed. It considers various conditions such as depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to decide the appropriate number of empty lines.

## Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the logic where it determines the number of empty lines to insert based on the depth and previous line attributes. In some cases, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines is incorrect or conflicts with the intended behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. **Update the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on the current line properties.
2. Ensure consistency in handling different cases and conditions.
3. Debug incrementally by testing each condition separately to identify where the issue lies.
4. Add more descriptive comments to clarify the purpose of each code block.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines has been adjusted to handle different cases more accurately, ensuring that the function behaves as intended without the bugs present in the original implementation.
