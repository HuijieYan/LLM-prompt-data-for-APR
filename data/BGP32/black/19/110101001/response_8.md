### Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears when determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The conditionals and return statements within the function may not correctly handle all cases, resulting in incorrect output values.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of various line types and the history of previous definitions. The function is not properly updating the number of empty lines based on the current line's properties and the previous line's characteristics. This leads to incorrect values returned by the function, failing the test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be refactored to correctly handle different scenarios and update the number of empty lines based on the conditions specified in the function. It is essential to consider each condition and adjust the logic to accurately determine the required number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the identified issues and ensure that the function returns the correct number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, passing the failing test cases.
