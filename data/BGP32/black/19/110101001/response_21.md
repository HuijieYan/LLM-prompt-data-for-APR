### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect assignment of the `before` variable within the while loop. The function is intended to calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. However, in the while loop, the `before` variable is erroneously updated with a fixed value of 1 if the `depth` is truthy (not 0) or 2 otherwise. This leads to incorrect calculations and unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should revise how the `before` variable is updated inside the while loop to ensure that it reflects the intended behavior based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else max_allowed
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
                
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By updating the `before` variable correctly within the while loop, the function should now behave as intended and pass the failing test cases provided.
