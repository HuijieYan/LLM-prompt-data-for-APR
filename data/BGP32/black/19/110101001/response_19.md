### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines is incorrect. The current implementation does not handle all the necessary conditions properly, leading to incorrect results for some cases. Specifically, the function fails to consider scenarios where certain flags (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc.) are set to `True`, impacting the calculation of the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revisit the logic for determining the number of potential extra empty lines. We should ensure that all relevant flags and conditions are taken into account to calculate the correct number of empty lines based on the context of the `current_line`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By revising the logic in the function to correctly handle all the necessary conditions based on the flags and context of the `current_line`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
