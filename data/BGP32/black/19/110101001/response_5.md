### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. 

The bug seems to stem from the logic used in handling the `is_decorator` condition. In the original code, when `is_decorator` is True along with other conditions, it prematurely returns a specific value without considering the case where `self.previous_line` is `None`. This causes a potential issue in determining the correct number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the case when `is_decorator` is true and `self.previous_line` is `None`. We can introduce additional checks to ensure that the appropriate number of empty lines are calculated based on all relevant conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line is None and current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adding a specific condition to handle the case when `self.previous_line` is `None` and `current_line.is_decorator`, we ensure that the function calculates the correct number of empty lines to insert in all scenarios, fixing the buggy behavior.
