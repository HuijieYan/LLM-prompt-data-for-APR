### Potential Error Location
1. The `while` loop updating the `before` variable seems to be causing inconsistencies in the value of `before`.
2. The check for `not is_decorator` inside the conditional block doesn't seem to have a clear purpose.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `before` variable inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. In different scenarios, the `before` value should either be updated to 1 or 2 based on certain conditions, but the `while` loop and other conditional blocks seem to be causing unexpected behavior. This leads to incorrect empty line calculations before and after the currently processed line, impacting the overall formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Remove the unnecessary `while` loop that updates the `before` variable.
2. Simplify the logic inside the conditional blocks to correctly handle the scenarios where the `before` value needs to be updated to 1 or 2 based on specific conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By removing the unnecessary `while` loop and adjusting the conditional logic, the updated function should now correctly calculate the required number of extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line, addressing the bug.
