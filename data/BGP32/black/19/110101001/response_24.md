### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect modification of the `before` variable when processing the previous definitions. The logic to handle the insertion of empty lines based on `before` and `depth` values is flawed, leading to incorrect output in certain scenarios.

1. In Case 3, the function should return `(0, 0)` because the `current_line` is a decorator. However, it incorrectly returns `(2, 0)` due to logic that doesn't consider the decorator case properly.
2. In Case 5, the function should return `(0, 0)` because the `current_line` is a decorator and the `previous_line` is also a decorator. However, it incorrectly returns `(2, 0)` due to an incorrect condition check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly for all cases, the logic for handling different scenarios in the function needs to be corrected. Specifically, the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line need to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (max_allowed if max_allowed else 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (max_allowed if max_allowed else 1), 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the correct conditions are checked for different line types and the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted accordingly.
