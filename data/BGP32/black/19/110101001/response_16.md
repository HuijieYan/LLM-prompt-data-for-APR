### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in how it handles the `before` value when updating it inside the `while` loop. The loop is intended to pop elements from `self.previous_defs` until it reaches a depth less than the current line's depth. However, the `before = 1 if depth else 2` line inside the loop always sets `before` to 1 or 2, regardless of other conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should only update the `before` value to 1 when `depth` is not 0 within the `while` loop. We also need to ensure that the correct value of `before` is retained from previous iterations if the while condition is not met.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is an updated version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth:
            before = 1
            max_allowed = 1
        else:
            before = max(before, 2)
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` value is correctly updated based on the conditions within the `while` loop and retains the correct value in subsequent iterations.
