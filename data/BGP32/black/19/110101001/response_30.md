### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect handling of the `before` variable. In some cases, the `before` variable is reassigned after a `while` loop iteration, leading to unexpected behavior. Specifically, in the `while` loop, the `before` variable is set to 1 or 2 based on certain conditions, but this assignment should not overwrite the initial value of `before`. This incorrect reassignment of `before` affects the subsequent logic and output of the function, causing failures in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the initial value of the `before` variable is preserved throughout the function execution. One way to achieve this is to introduce a new variable to store the updated value of `before` within the `while` loop without affecting the original `before` value. This way, we can maintain the correct behavior of the logic and address the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    original_before = before  # Store the original value of before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return original_before, 1  # Use the original value of before

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0

    return original_before, 0  # Use the original value of before
```

By storing the original value of `before` in the `original_before` variable and using it where necessary, we maintain the correct behavior and address the bug in the function.
