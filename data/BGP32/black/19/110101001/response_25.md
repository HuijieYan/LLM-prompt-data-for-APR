### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of the variable `before` during certain conditions. In specific cases, the `before` variable is not updated correctly, leading to incorrect computations and results.

1. In Case 1, the `before` variable should be set to `1` when updating it inside the while loop. However, it is overwritten to `2` in the next line, leading to an incorrect value for `before`.
2. In Case 7, after the `while` loop, the `before` variable should be set to `1` when `depth` is truthy. However, the assignment of `2` is incorrect in this situation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions within the function. Specifically, we need to adjust the assignments of `before` to match the expected behavior according to the conditions in each case.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function properly handles the `before` variable updates in the while loop and after it. This correction ensures that the function returns the expected results for the different conditions encountered in the function.
