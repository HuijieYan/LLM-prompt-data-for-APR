### Issue:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the calculation of extra newlines before and after the currently processed line is incorrect in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect output and failing test cases.

### Bug Cause:
1. In cases where `current_line` is a decorator, the logic to handle empty lines is flawed.
2. In scenarios where the previous line is an import statement and the current line is not, but both have the same depth, the logic incorrectly determines the number of empty lines needed.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for handling empty lines before and after a decorator statement.
2. Fix the calculation for cases where the previous line is an import statement to ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    before = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if not current_line.is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    return before, 0
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the logic for handling decorators to return the correct number of empty lines before and after.
2. Corrected the calculation for cases where there is an import statement mismatch in depth to return the appropriate number of empty lines.
3. Rearranged the conditions to ensure correct handling of each scenario.
