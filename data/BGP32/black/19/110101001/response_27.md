### Error Location
The bug lies in the handling of the `before` variable. The value of `before` is being incorrectly reassigned within the `while` loop, leading to incorrect calculations based on the depth of the current line.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to reassignment of the `before` variable inside the `while` loop. As the loop iterates over `self.previous_defs`, the `before` variable is being overwritten with `1 if depth else 2`, which distorts the intended calculation of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to maintain the initial value of `before` and apply the `1 if depth else 2` logic only when modifying the `newlines` variable. This will ensure that the correct number of empty lines is computed based on the depth of the current line while preserving the original value of `before`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    original_before = before  # Store the original value of before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = original_before  # Restore the original value
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By storing and restoring the original value of `before` within the loop, we can fix the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the context of the current line.
