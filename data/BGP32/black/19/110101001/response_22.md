### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the logic that determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue arises when certain conditions are met, like not inserting empty lines before the first line or between decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the cases where empty lines should or should not be inserted before or after certain lines. We need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version includes updated logic that correctly handles the cases where empty lines should be inserted or not based on the context of the current and previous lines. It ensures that the correct number of empty lines is returned according to the rules specified.
