### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line while formatting code. The issue arises in calculating the number of empty lines before the current line. In several cases, the logic incorrectly handles the calculation of the `before` variable, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Ensure that the correct logic is applied to calculate the number of empty lines before the current line.
2. Evaluate the conditions where the `before` variable is assigned a value and adjust the calculation based on the requirements.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic for calculating the `before` variable and ensuring consistent handling of empty lines before the current line, the function should now provide the correct number of empty lines needed for code formatting.
