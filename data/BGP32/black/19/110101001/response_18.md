### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the implementation that cause unexpected behavior. Here are some of the key issues:
1. The logic for handling previous definitions is flawed and may lead to incorrect results.
2. The handling of different line types (decorators, flow control, imports, yields) and depth levels is not properly factored in.
3. The conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert are not accurately defined.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of previous definitions and incorrect logic flow when determining the number of empty lines to insert based on different line types and depth levels. The function lacks clarity in its conditions and may produce unexpected results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling previous definitions, line type conditions, and depth levels. We should ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the context of the code.

### Updated Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    else:
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version improves the handling of previous definitions, line types, and depth levels to ensure accurate calculation of the required empty lines.
