### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The function incorrectly handles certain cases such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields, leading to incorrect empty line counts.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to update the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line. We need to handle different cases such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields correctly to ensure the output is as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 0
        before = 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines = 0 if before == 0 else 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines = 0 if before == 0 else 1
    else:
        newlines = 0

    return before, newlines
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in handling different conditions and should now output the correct number of empty lines required before and after the current line.
