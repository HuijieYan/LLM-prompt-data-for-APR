### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic where it determines the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The issue is that the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines required based on certain conditions, such as decorators, definitions, flow controls, imports, and yields. This leads to incorrect output values and causes the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that the conditions for decorators, definitions, flow controls, imports, and yields are correctly evaluated.
3. Update the logic to accurately calculate the number of empty lines based on the specific conditions.
4. Make sure to consider all possible scenarios in which empty lines may be required or not.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return max(0, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
```

This corrected version has been updated to address the issues present in the original function by fixing the logic for determining the number of empty lines required before and after the current line. Now, the function should provide the correct output values and pass the failing tests.
