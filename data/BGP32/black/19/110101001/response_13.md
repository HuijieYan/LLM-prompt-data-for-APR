### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines before and after certain types of lines. The function is meant to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line based on various conditions like decorators, flow control, imports, etc. However, based on the failing test cases and the runtime values, it seems that the logic is not working correctly for all scenarios.

### Bug Identification:
1. The logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line is not handling all cases correctly.
2. In Case 7, where the current line is a definition of function `def foo():`, the calculation of newlines is incorrect.
3. There is inconsistent handling of `is_decorator` and `current_line.is_decorator`.
4. The handling of `depth` and `previous_defs` seems to be causing issues in determining the correct number of newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic correctly identifies the different cases like decorators, flow control, imports, etc., and calculates the correct number of newlines.
2. Review the handling of `depth` and `previous_defs` to ensure correct tracking of line depths.
3. Check the conditionals related to decorators to ensure they are correctly handling the cases.
4. Avoid resetting the `before` variable in the loop and use it consistently based on conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if not self.previous_defs or self.previous_defs[-1] < current_line.depth:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    else:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the identified bug locations and strategies, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
