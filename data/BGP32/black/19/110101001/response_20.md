### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when determining the number of newlines needed before and after the currently processed line. One specific issue is with the logic when handling decorators. If the current line is a decorator and the previous line is also a decorator, the function incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` instead of inserting an empty line. This can lead to incorrect formatting when dealing with decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the cases where the current line is a decorator and consider the previous line's decorator status when returning the number of newlines.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator:
            return 1, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line is not None
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line is not None
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this adjustment in the logic for handling decorators and properly checking the decorator status of the previous line, the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle cases involving decorators and provide the expected number of newlines before and after the current line.
