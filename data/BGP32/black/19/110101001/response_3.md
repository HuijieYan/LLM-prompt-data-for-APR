### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. In several branches of the function, the return values are incorrectly determined, leading to incorrect spacing between lines. 

1. In the case when `is_decorator` or `is_def` or `is_class` is True, the function incorrectly sets the number of newlines to 2, regardless of the current depth. This results in extra unnecessary newlines added before the line.

2. Additionally, when `is_decorator` is True and the `previous_line` is also a decorator, the function incorrectly returns 0 for both before and after newlines, which should not happen.

3. The logic for handling `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` cases is flawed, resulting in incorrect spacing decisions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line based on the different conditions specified.

1. Update the logic for handling `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` cases to consider the depth of the current line and adjust the number of newlines accordingly.

2. Correctly handle the case when both the current line and the previous line are decorators to ensure the correct number of newlines are returned.

3. Update the logic for `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` cases to ensure proper spacing between lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if current_line.depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections to the function, the spacing logic should now correctly determine the number of newlines needed before and after each line based on the surrounding context.
