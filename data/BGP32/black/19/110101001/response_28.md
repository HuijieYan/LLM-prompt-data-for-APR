### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. In some cases, the logic does not consider all the necessary conditions, resulting in incorrect empty line counts.

### Bug Causes
1. The check for `self.previous_line` being `None` and directly returning `0, 0` in that case may not cover all scenarios where empty lines should not be inserted.
2. The condition for returning `newlines, 0` for decorators and definitions doesn't accurately account for the depth and the presence of the previous line.
3. The evaluations for flow control, imports, and yields may not return the correct empty line counts under specific conditions.
4. The handling of the `self.previous_defs` list and its interaction with depth can lead to incorrect assignments of empty line counts.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the logic to ensure all edge cases are covered when determining the number of empty lines.
2. Refine the conditions for decorators and definitions to include relevant checks for the previous line state.
3. Re-evaluate the conditions for flow control, imports, and yields to accurately calculate the correct number of empty lines.
4. Adjust the management of the `self.previous_defs` list to properly track depth changes and handle empty line insertions accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By refining the logic and considering all edge cases, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line, passing the failing test cases.
