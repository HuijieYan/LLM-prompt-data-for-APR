### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises when determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. The logic in the function is meant to handle different cases based on the properties of the current line and the previous line. However, due to incorrect handling of the `self.previous_line` variable and the conditions for inserting empty lines, the function fails to return the expected number of empty lines in certain scenarios.

### Bug Location
1. The condition where `if self.previous_line is None` checks for the presence of a previous line, but directly returns `0, 0` without considering the context. This causes issues in scenarios where empty lines should be inserted.
   
2. The condition where `if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` creates confusion between different situations that require distinct handling. This results in incorrect decisions regarding empty line insertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic based on the requirements for inserting empty lines before and after each line. It involves revisiting the conditions and ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the context of the current and previous lines.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    before_exit, after_exit = 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line:
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            if current_line.depth:
                after_exit += 1
        else:
            if current_line.is_flow_control:
                before_exit = before
                after_exit += 1
            elif self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                before_exit = before or 1
            elif self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
                before_exit = before or 1
    
    return before_exit, after_exit
```

In the corrected version, the logic has been restructured to properly handle the scenarios where empty lines need to be inserted based on the properties of the current and previous lines. This revision ensures that the function returns the correct number of empty lines before and after each line, resolving the bug.
