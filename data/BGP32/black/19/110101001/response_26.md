### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect logic used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. In Case 1, the function incorrectly sets `newlines` to 2 even when the depth is 0, leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being returned. Additionally, in Case 3, the logic does not handle empty newlines properly, resulting in erroneous output. These cases indicate that the function is not correctly handling the conditions to determine the number of empty lines needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to analyze how the current line's attributes (such as depth, type, etc.) affect the calculation of empty lines. We should ensure that the conditional branches in the function are correctly evaluating these attributes. Specifically, we need to address issues like setting `newlines` to a fixed value without considering all edge cases, handling empty newlines properly, and adjusting the calculation based on the line attributes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we can ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on all relevant attributes and conditions. This should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
