### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable when updating the count of empty lines. In several cases, the value of `before` being set to 1 or 2 overwrites the correct value instead of being summed with the existing value. This incorrect handling leads to deviations in the expected number of extra empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable correctly accumulates the total number of newlines needed. This involves adjusting the logic around updating the `before` variable to correctly sum the current value with the computed amount of newlines. 

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before += 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the bug by correctly updating the `before` variable based on the accumulated number of newlines required.
