### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line. The function is not handling the case where the `self.previous_line` is not `None`, but it is also not a decorator or an import, causing incorrect returns of `(before, 1)` in some cases where it should return `(before, 0)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions for returning `(before, 1)` to handle the case when the `self.previous_line` is not None and it does not match the conditions for decorators or imports.

### Corrected Version of the Function
I will modify the logic around the conditions that return `(before, 1)` to properly handle cases where the current line is not a decorator or an import and the previous line is not a decorator or an import. 
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not self.previous_line.is_decorator
        and not self.previous_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the cases where an incorrect `(before, 1)` was previously returned, leading to passing the failing tests.
