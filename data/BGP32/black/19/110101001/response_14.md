### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to how the function `_maybe_empty_lines` calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function makes decisions based on different conditions like whether the current line is a decorator, def, class, flow control, import, or yield. However, in some cases, it fails to handle these conditions correctly, leading to incorrect return values.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the logic where the function checks for the type of the current line (decorator, def, class, flow control, import, yield) and decides how many empty lines to add before and after.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of different line types (decorator, def, class, flow control, etc.), which leads to inconsistencies in determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the line.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the conditions used to calculate the number of empty lines. We should ensure that each condition is correctly handled and that the logic for determining the number of empty lines is consistent with the expected behavior for each line type.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    else:
        self.previous_defs.add(depth)

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, I made adjustments to the handling of previous_defs by using a set to store the depths of previous lines. I also fixed some conditional statements and return values to ensure consistency in determining the number of empty lines to insert. This corrected version should address the issues causing the failing tests.
