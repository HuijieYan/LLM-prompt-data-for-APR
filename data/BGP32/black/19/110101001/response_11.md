### Bug Analysis

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several potential issues:
1. The logic for handling the `depth` parameter within the while loop may not be correctly updating the `before` variable.
2. The conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line might have incorrect checks.

Based on the failing test cases provided, the function is not producing the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, where `current_line` is a decorator, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(2, 0)` when `is_decorator` is True.
2. In Case 2, the input `current_line` is a line with a comment, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(0, 1)` when `is_decorator` is False.
3. In Case 3, when the previous line is also a decorator, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(2, 0)` when `is_decorator` is True.
4. In Case 4, when the current line has a different prefix than the previous line, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(0, 1)` when `is_decorator` is False.
5. In Case 5, when the previous line is different from the current line, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(2, 0)` when `is_decorator` is False.
6. In Case 6, when both the current and previous lines are decorators, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(2, 0)` when `is_decorator` is True.
7. In Case 7, when the current line is a definition, the expected output is `(1, 0)` but the function is returning `(0, 0)` when `is_decorator` is False.
8. In Case 8, when the `depth` is greater than 0, the expected output is `(0, 0)` but the function is returning `(1, 0)` when `is_decorator` is False.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line are correctly implemented.
2. Pay attention to the `depth` parameter and how it should affect the final output.
3. Review the logic inside the while loop to correctly handle updating the `before` variable.

### Fixed Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        top_def_depth = self.previous_defs[-1]
        while top_def_depth >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            if depth == 0:
                before = 2
            else:
                before = 1
            if not self.previous_defs:
                break

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if not current_line.is_flow_control:
            return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with the buggy behavior and pass the failing test cases provided.
