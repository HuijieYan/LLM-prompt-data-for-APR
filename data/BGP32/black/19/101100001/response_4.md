## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line based on certain conditions.
2. The function checks various conditions related to indentation, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to decide the number of empty lines.
3. The bug is likely related to the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` which is trying to access the `is_import` attribute directly on the `self.previous_line` object. This attribute is not defined directly in the `Line` class.
4. Accessing the `is_import` attribute should be done using the helper function `is_import(self.previous_line)`.
5. The buggy function needs to be corrected to use the `is_import` helper function correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use the `is_import` helper function to check if the previous line is an import line instead of accessing the attribute directly.
2. Modify the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly determine if the previous line is an import line.
3. This should resolve the bug related to accessing the `is_import` attribute incorrectly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the usage of the `is_import` helper function to check if the previous line is an import line, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test.
