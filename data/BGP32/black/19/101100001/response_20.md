## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a logic flaw that causes it to incorrectly handle cases related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. The issue arises from incorrect conditions and calculations within the function, causing it to return incorrect values when determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. Additionally, the function does not properly handle cases where the previous line is an import or a yield, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The function does not correctly handle cases where the current line is a decorator, def statement, or class statement. This results in incorrect calculations for the number of newlines to insert.
2. The function does not properly handle cases where the previous line is a decorator, which leads to incorrect decisions when inserting empty lines.
3. The conditions related to imports and yields are not accurately evaluated, causing incorrect behavior when determining the number of empty lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling decorators, def statements, and class statements to correctly calculate the number of empty lines based on the current line's properties.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles cases where the previous line is a decorator to avoid inserting unnecessary empty lines.
3. Fix the conditions related to imports and yields to accurately determine the number of newlines to insert based on the context.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth > 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logical errors and updating the conditions in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the corrected version should now properly handle cases involving decorators, imports, yields, and other scenarios, passing the failing test provided.
