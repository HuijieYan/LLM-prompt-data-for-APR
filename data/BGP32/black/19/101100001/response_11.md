### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for handling empty lines in the code based on certain conditions such as depth, decorators, imports, etc.
2. The function makes decisions based on the properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line` objects.
3. There is a bug in the function related to the condition where it checks if the `previous_line` is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`, which causes an AttributeError since the `is_import` function is not called correctly.
  
### Bug:
- The bug occurs when trying to check if the `self.previous_line` is an import by calling `self.previous_line.is_import`, which should actually be calling the `is_import` function with the `self.previous_line` leaf as an argument.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the line `self.previous_line.is_import` to use the `is_import` function correctly by passing the leaf from the `self.previous_line`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By modifying the condition to use the `is_import` function correctly, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
