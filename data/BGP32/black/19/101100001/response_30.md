### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several conditions and calculations to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue seems to be related to the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` which attempts to access the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line`. However, `is_import` is a function, not an attribute, causing the bug.

### Bug Explanation:
When the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` tries to access `self.previous_line.is_import`, it assumes that `is_import` is an attribute of `previous_line`, leading to an `AttributeError`. This error prevents the function from properly determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to call the `is_import` function correctly by passing the `self.previous_line` as an argument. This will correctly determine if the previous line is an import statement and adjust the number of empty lines accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by calling the `is_import` function correctly with `self.previous_line` as an argument to check if the previous line is an import statement. This ensures the function behaves as intended and can determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line accurately.
