## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes a `current_line` parameter of type `Line`.
2. Within the function, it checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to insert.
3. There is a reference to `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`, indicating that these attributes are expected to be present in the class where this function belongs.
4. The bug seems to be related to the `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `self.previous_line.is_import` conditions which are not correctly referencing the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly referencing `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `self.previous_line.is_import`. These references should actually be calling the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions respectively. Due to this mistake, the conditions are not being evaluated correctly, leading to incorrect results and failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the references to `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` should be replaced with calls to the `is_import` function. Similarly, the reference to `current_line.is_yield` should be revised to call the `is_yield` function. This will ensure that the correct properties are accessed and evaluated, fixing the bug in the process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between imports.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The calls to `current_line.is_import` have been replaced with `is_import(current_line)` to correctly check if the current line is an import.
- The reference to `self.previous_line.is_import` has been updated to `is_import(self.previous_line)` for checking if the previous line is an import.
- The call to `current_line.is_yield` has been modified to `current_line.is_yield()` to correctly evaluate if the current line is a yield statement.
