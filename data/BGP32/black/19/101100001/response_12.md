## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes in a `current_line` object and adjusts the number of empty lines before the current line based on certain conditions like depth, prefix counts, decorators, imports, etc.
2. The function uses attributes and methods like `depth`, `leaves`, `prefix`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to determine the number of empty lines.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` and `previous_line` objects, which is not being handled correctly leading to failing tests.

## Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function is trying to check if the `current_line` is an import statement or not. It does so by checking `current_line.is_import` attribute, but this attribute is not set correctly within the function itself.
2. The function is not directly setting the `is_import` attribute for the `current_line` object, but trying to access it which results in a NameError (undefined variable) since `is_import` is actually a separate function imported from the same file but not part of the `Line` class attributes. 

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` attribute is correctly set for the `current_line` object before checking it within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. One way to fix this is to modify the `is_import` function to set the `is_import` attribute for the `current_line` object before that object is passed to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
3. Another approach could be to add a condition inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` object before checking the `is_import` attribute.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_import():  # Check if current line is an import
        return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I added `current_line.is_import()` calls to properly handle the import checks. This should allow the function to correctly determine whether the current line is an import statement or not, fixing the bug.
