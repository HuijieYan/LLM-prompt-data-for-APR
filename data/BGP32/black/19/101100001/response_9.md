## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function has a reference to `self`, which suggests that it is a method of a class.
2. The function makes comparisons and decisions based on properties of the `current_line` object.
3. The function uses attributes like `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` of the `current_line`. 
4. The function updates `before` and `depth` based on conditions.
5. There are conditions to check for certain cases like decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` which tries to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line`, assuming it is a `bool`. In Python, trying to access an attribute directly like this can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the attribute is not defined.
Additionally, the function `is_import` is a separate function defined outside the scope of the class where `_maybe_empty_lines` is defined, so calling it directly on `self.previous_line` will not yield the expected result.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we properly check the condition related to imports in a way that accounts for the correct attribute or method to be called. We can compare the `depth` value and `is_import` directly, without relying on a standalone function to determine if the line is an import line.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In this corrected version, the check for imports has been updated to directly compare `current_line.is_import` attribute with `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling a separate function. This change should help resolve the bug related to the incorrect function call.
