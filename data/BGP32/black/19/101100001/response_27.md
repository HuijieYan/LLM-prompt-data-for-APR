### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. One of the conditions it checks is whether the previous line is an import line using `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, the `is_import` function is never called correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorrectly trying to access the attribute `is_import` directly on `self.previous_line` without actually calling the `is_import` function. This leads to an AttributeError since `self.previous_line` does not have the `is_import` attribute directly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_import` function on `self.previous_line` correctly to determine if it is an import line. This can be achieved by updating the condition from `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above correction, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly determine if the previous line is an import line by calling the `is_import` function on `self.previous_line`. This correction should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
