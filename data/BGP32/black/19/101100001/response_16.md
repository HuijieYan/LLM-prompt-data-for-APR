### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert between code lines. It checks various conditions related to indentation depth, line types, and previous lines to make this determination. 

### Issues:
1. The function is trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` but the `is_import` function is defined in a separate part of the file and should be called externally.
2. The check `depth == self.previous_line.depth` may lead to incorrect results if `self.previous_line` is None.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the direct access to `is_import` function within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function which is not possible. Additionally, there are scenarios where the code tries to access properties of `self.previous_line` without proper checking for `None` values.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Separate the logic for checking if a line is an import to an external function.
2. Add checks for `None` before accessing properties of `self.previous_line`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.depth is not None
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues identified and should pass the failing test.
