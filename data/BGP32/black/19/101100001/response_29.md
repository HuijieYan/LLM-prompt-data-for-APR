## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for managing empty lines based on certain conditions within the source code. It checks the depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to add/remove.

The issue in the buggy function lies in the condition checking for `self.previous_line.is_import`. This condition is incorrect because `is_import` is a function, not a property of `self.previous_line`. It should be calling the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument to get the correct result.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` fails to correctly identify imports due to the incorrect usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to properly check if the previous line is an import.
2. Ensure to pass the necessary arguments to the `is_import` function to accurately determine if a line is an import.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the mentioned correction in the `if` condition, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly handle imports and pass the failing test.
