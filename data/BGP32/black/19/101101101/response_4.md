## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has an issue that causes it to not handle certain conditions correctly, leading to failing tests. Here are the main problems identified:
1. The function doesn't check if `current_line` is `None`, which can cause errors.
2. The handling of `is_decorator` and `current_line.is_decorator` checks is incorrect.
3. The logic for checking `is_flow_control` condition is not accurate.
4. The conditions for handling `is_import` are not properly checked.
5. The logic for the `depth` calculation needs improvement.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the identified issues by:
1. Adding a conditional check to handle the case where `current_line` is `None`.
2. Correcting the checks for `is_decorator` and `current_line.is_decorator`.
3. Adjusting the logic for handling `is_flow_control`.
4. Refining the conditions for `is_import`.
5. Improving the `depth` calculation for consistent behavior. 

## The Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Optional[Line]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues and should now pass the failing test cases.
