## Bug Analysis:
The bug is occurring because the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` incorrectly handles the condition related to the `self.previous_line.is_import` attribute. The buggy function tries to access the attribute `is_import` directly on the `self.previous_line` object, but `is_import` is a function defined outside the class. Hence, the comparison fails, leading to incorrect behavior in the function.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function from within the buggy function instead of trying to access it as an attribute directly on the `self.previous_line`. This will ensure that the correct comparison is made, and the function behaves as intended.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By modifying the condition to call the `is_import` function correctly in the comparison, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
