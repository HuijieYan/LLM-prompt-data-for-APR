## Bug Fix Strategy
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have issues related to handling empty lines correctly based on the input line properties. This causes the failing tests as the function does not output the expected results in certain scenarios. 

One of the main issues is with the conditionals and assignments regarding `before` and `newlines`. There are several complex conditions that need to be streamlined for better readability and correctness.

Here is a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the conditional statements to better handle the different cases.
2. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the input line properties.
3. Manage the removal of extra newlines effectively in the function.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the mentioned strategy.

## Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues observed during the analysis and should result in the correct behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
