## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how the `before` value is being calculated and updated within the function. The issue arises from the calculation of `before` in different conditions without considering the previously calculated value. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly update the `before` variable according to each condition.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is primarily caused by inconsistent handling of the `before` variable depending on the different conditions within the function. This leads to incorrect behavior in determining the number of empty lines to insert. The function does not maintain the correct number of empty lines and may overwrite the expected `before` value.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable accounts for previous calculations properly and updates based on specific conditions. By adjusting the logic related to `before`, we can address the issue and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            before = 1 if depth else 2
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return (before or 1), 0
            if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
                return (before or 1), 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for calculating the `before` variable and handling the conditions that affect the number of empty lines in the correct way, the fixed function should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test cases.
