## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the logic to determine the number of empty lines before the current line. The issue seems to stem from the conditionals and assignments within the function, especially with respect to handling decorators, import statements, yield statements, and flow control statements.

In the failing test case, the input parameters and the values of relevant variables are not leading to the correct output. The discrepancies stem from the incorrect handling of different scenarios within the function, resulting in unexpected values for `newlines`, `before`, and `is_decorator`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling decorators, import statements, yield statements, and flow control statements to correctly determine the number of empty lines before the current line.
2. Ensure that the correct values are assigned to `newlines`, `before`, and `is_decorator` based on the conditions specified in the function.
3. Update the function to handle the cases where the appropriate number of empty lines should be inserted based on the context of the current and previous lines.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    unless = False
    for leaf in current_line.leaves:
        if leaf.type == AT:
            unless = True
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if unless:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic and conditions within the function, as shown above, we can ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted before the current line based on the context of the code structure.
