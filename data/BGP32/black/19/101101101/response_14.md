## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect check for the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line`. In the buggy function, the check for `current_line.is_import` is done directly using `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, the `is_import` attribute is set via a separate function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`, and this function is never called to determine the `is_import` value for the current line.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to modify the logic to correctly check if the `current_line` is an import line using the `is_import` function. This involves calling the `is_import` function with the appropriate leaf element from the `current_line` leaves.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line.leaves[0]) # Check if the current line is import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly determine if the `current_line` is an import line by calling the `is_import` function with the appropriate leaf element. This fix addresses the bug and ensures that the function behaves as expected during the failing test cases.
