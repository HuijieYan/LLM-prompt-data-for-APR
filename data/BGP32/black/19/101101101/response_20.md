Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided test cases, the bug seems to be related to the handling of `before` and `newlines` variables. In particular, the conditions for calculating these variables based on `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, and other properties of `current_line` are not functioning as intended, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly determine the number of empty lines before the current line. We should consider the conditions for various line types (such as decorators, definitions, imports, yield statements) and the depth of the current line compared to the previous line, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on these criteria.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I have adjusted the conditions and updated the logic to handle different cases based on the types of lines and their properties. The function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines before the current line as expected in the failing test cases.
