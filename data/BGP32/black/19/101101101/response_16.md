After analyzing the buggy function and its runtime values, it seems that the issue lies in the conditions that determine the number of newlines to return. Specifically, there might be a problem with the logic in the code block that calculates the number of newlines based on different scenarios of the current and previous lines.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the different conditions. We can simplify the logic and improve readability to avoid potential issues.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not current_line.is_import
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the different conditions specified in the cases. It should now pass the failing test provided.
