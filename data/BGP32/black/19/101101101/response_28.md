## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition checks related to empty lines insertion. The function incorrectly handles the cases where it should return the number of newlines before and after the line based on various conditions such as decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields. The incorrect logic in these conditions leads to the failing test cases.

### Issues with the Buggy Function
1. The function does not correctly handle the case where it should insert empty lines before a new line but doesn't return the expected number of empty lines.
2. The logic involving decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements is flawed and leads to incorrect newline counts.
3. The management of the `previous_defs` list is not appropriate, leading to incorrect decisions.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following corrections need to be applied:
1. Properly handle the scenarios where empty lines need to be inserted based on various conditions.
2. Ensure that the logic for counting newlines before and after the current line is accurate.
3. Fix the management of the `previous_defs` list for correct decision-making.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing the corrections mentioned above, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before and after lines based on different conditions and pass all the failing test cases.
