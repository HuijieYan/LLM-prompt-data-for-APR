## Buggy Function Explanation:

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before a given line based on certain conditions related to the line's content and the previous line. However, the buggy function fails to correctly handle cases where the previous line has specific characteristics, such as being an import line or a yield line, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

### Issues:
1. The function incorrectly identifies whether the previous line is an import line by using `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of utilizing the `is_import` function.
2. The function does not properly handle cases where the previous line is an import or a yield line, resulting in incorrect empty line insertion decisions.

## Fix Strategy:

To address the issues mentioned above and correct the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to:
1. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function to correctly determine if the previous line is an import.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the previous line is an import or a yield by adjusting the logic for inserting empty lines based on these conditions.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if is_import(current_line):
        if self.previous_line and not is_import(self.previous_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now correctly handle cases involving import lines and yield lines, ensuring proper insertion of empty lines based on the defined conditions.
