The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how it handles the logic for inserting empty lines based on certain conditions. The function is not correctly updating the `before` value under specific circumstances, causing it to return an incorrect number of empty lines.

Based on the analyzed runtime values and types of variables along with the expected values and types, the bug occurs when the function is expected to return `before` as `0`, but it sometimes retains the previous value instead. This issue leads to the incorrect number of empty lines being returned.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `before` value is correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the function. Specifically, when the condition dictates that `before` should be `0`, we need to make sure that the value is updated accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the provided fix:
- The code has been modified to correctly update the `before` value based on various conditions that determine the number of empty lines to return.
- The comparison for checking if the previous line is an import has been changed to call the `is_import` function, which was missing previously.

This corrected version should address the buggy behavior and ensure that the function returns the expected number of empty lines under different scenarios.
