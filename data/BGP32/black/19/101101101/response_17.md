## Correction of the buggy function

Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected values, it appears that the issue lies in the logic where the function determines the number of empty lines to return based on the current line's attributes. The correction involves updating the logic to properly handle different cases and conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if any([current_line.is_decorator, current_line.is_def, current_line.is_class]):
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 0 if before == 0 else 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 0 if before == 0 else 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the different cases and conditions properly, addressing the previously identified issues. It is expected to pass the failing test cases provided.
