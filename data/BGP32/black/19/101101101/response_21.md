After analyzing the function and the failing test cases, we can identify the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue arises from the condition where we check if the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object is `True`. However, we haven't set a corresponding attribute `is_import` specifically for the `Line` class, resulting in the condition failing to evaluate correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the function to correctly identify the `is_import` attribute for a line. One way to do this is to update the `Line` class to have an `is_import` attribute and set it accordingly when needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object using the `hasattr` function to avoid the bug related to the missing attribute.

By implementing this correction, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the conditions based on the `is_import` attribute of the `Line` class.
