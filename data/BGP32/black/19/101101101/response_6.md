## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines in specific situations within a code file based on certain conditions defined by the `current_line`. However, the function fails to correctly determine the number of newlines to insert in some scenarios.

### Issues Identified:
1. The function incorrectly sets `max_allowed` as 2 initially, which should be set to 1 by default.
2. In some cases, the function fails to handle the conditions properly to decide on the number of newlines to insert.
3. The handling of `depth` and `is_decorator` variables is incorrect in some scenarios.

### Testing:
Based on the provided test cases, the function fails to insert the correct number of newlines in various scenarios. By comparing the runtime values with the expected values, we can identify the points where the function needs to be corrected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the initialization of `max_allowed` to be set to 1 by default.
2. Check and correct the conditions that determine the number of newlines to be inserted based on the `current_line` properties.
3. Ensure that the handling of `depth` and `is_decorator` variables aligns with the intended behavior of the function.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)
        and current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not self.is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and current_line.is_yield
        and depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections and ensuring that the conditions in the function align with the expected behavior in the test cases, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be fixed.
