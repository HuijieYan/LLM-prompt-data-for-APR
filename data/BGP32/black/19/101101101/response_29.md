## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to checking whether `current_line` is an import or a yield line. The function uses the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes of the `current_line` object to determine if it's an import or yield line. However, the function is incorrectly calling `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` instead of `is_import(current_line)` and `is_yield(current_line)`.

The reason for the bug is that the function is directly accessing the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes of the `previous_line` object, assuming they are present, which is not the case. Instead, it should be calling the related functions (`is_import` and `is_yield`) with the `current_line` object as an argument for proper evaluation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to update the conditions where it checks if the `previous_line` is an import or a yield line. We should replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` with `is_yield(self.previous_line)`.

By making this change, the function will correctly check whether the `current_line` is an import or yield line by calling the related functions `is_import` and `is_yield` with the `current_line` object as an argument.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between imports.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By replacing the incorrect references to `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` and `is_yield(self.previous_line)` respectively, we ensure that the function correctly checks if the `previous_line` is an import or a yield line.
