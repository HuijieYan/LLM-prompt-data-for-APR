### Bug Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle cases where empty lines should be added or removed based on certain conditions related to the structure of the input `current_line`.

One potential bug in the function is in the block that handles decorators, definitions, and classes. In this block, there are checks for `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, and `current_line.is_class`; however, the logic inside these conditions is not aligned with the expected behavior, leading to incorrect handling of empty lines.

### Bug Cause:
1. When the `current_line` is identified as a decorator or a definition or a class, the logic inside the corresponding condition is not accurately determining the correct number of newlines to be inserted.
2. Incorrect handling in the condition for decorators, which is causing the function to return incorrect newline values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic inside the decorator, definition, and class block to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines.
2. Ensure that the function accurately determines the number of newlines to insert based on the context of the current line.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - (1 if current_line.depth else 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately handle the conditions for decorators, definitions, and classes, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the given context.
