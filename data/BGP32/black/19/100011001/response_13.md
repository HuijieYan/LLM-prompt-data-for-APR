### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines before specific types of lines such as decorators, defs, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields. The issue arises when determining the number of newlines to insert before these lines based on specific conditions related to the previous line and the current line.

Looking at the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it seems that the function is not handling the empty line insertion logic correctly, resulting in incorrect output and failing tests. In particular, the function seems to be incorrectly handling the case when there are decorators with comments in between.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully examine the conditions for inserting empty lines and ensure that the logic is correctly handled for each case.

1. Revise the logic for handling decorators, defs, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert.
2. Pay close attention to handling decorators with comments in between to ensure correct behavior.
3. Update the return values based on the specific conditions to accurately reflect the required number of empty lines.
4. Consider the edge cases and ensure that the function covers all possible scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.leaves and any(leaf.type == COMMENT for leaf in current_line.leaves):
            # Handle comments in decorators
            return 1, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have added a specific case to handle comments within decorators correctly. By including this case, the function should now handle the scenarios involving decorators with comments as observed in the failing test case. Make sure to test the corrected version with the failing test cases to confirm the fix.
