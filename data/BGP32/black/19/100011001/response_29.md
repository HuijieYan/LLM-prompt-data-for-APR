### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the handling of newlines before certain types of lines. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of newlines to insert before a given line based on various conditions and context. However, the calculations for the number of newlines are incorrect, leading to incorrect formatting of the lines.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 2, the function is inserting unnecessary empty lines before a line that starts with '# TODO: X'. This behavior is not intended and leads to incorrect output.
2. In Case 3, the function returns 2 newlines before a decorator line starting with '@property', but only 1 newline is expected. This inconsistency in newlines results in a formatting mismatch.
3. In Case 6, the function is inserting 2 newlines before a line that should have just 1 newline based on the conditions mentioned in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that determines the number of newlines to be inserted before a line. We should carefully review the conditions and comparisons leading to the calculation of newlines and ensure they align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted before a line based on different conditions. This updated logic aims to address the issues identified in the bug analysis above and should produce the expected output.
