### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is primarily related to the logic around inserting empty lines. The function is intended to determine whether empty lines should be inserted before the current line based on various conditions related to the current line's properties, such as depth, type (e.g., decorator, def, class), and the previous line's properties.

Based on the failing test case, the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain scenarios, resulting in incorrect formatting output.

#### Issues:
1. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line is complex and may not cover all edge cases correctly.
2. The handling of conditions related to decorators, imports, and other line types seems to be leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revisit the logic for inserting empty lines and ensure that it covers all necessary scenarios correctly. Specifically, we need to review the conditional statements and their handling of different line types to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        # Insert 1 newline if current line has depth.
        return 1 if current_line.depth else 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return (1 if current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth else 0), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not (current_line.is_yield and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By simplifying the logic and ensuring correct handling of different scenarios, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and produce the expected output.
