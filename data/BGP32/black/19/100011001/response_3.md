### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrect handling of empty lines in certain cases. The function is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous lines. The bug causes incorrect insertion of empty lines in some specific scenarios, leading to failing test cases.

The problematic scenarios include non-ideal handling of decorators, definitions (`def`), flow control statements, imports, and yields. The current logic does not properly account for these cases, resulting in incorrect newline insertion, leading to failed test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revise the logic for inserting empty lines based on the current line's context and the context of the previous line. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function accurately handles decorators, definitions, flow control statements, imports, and yields to follow the expected formatting rules.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the updated and corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes revised logic to handle decorators, definitions, flow control statements, imports, and yields appropriately to ensure the proper insertion of empty lines as per the expected formatting rules.
