### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrect handling of the `newlines` variable. In certain cases, the function erroneously sets the `newlines` value to 2 even though it should be set to 1, leading to incorrect output and assertion failures in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for setting the `newlines` variable to ensure it accurately reflects the expected number of empty lines based on the current line and the previous line.
2. Make sure to consider all possible scenarios and conditions to determine the correct value for `newlines`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By updating the logic to determine the value of the `newlines` variable based on the current and previous lines, the corrected function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
