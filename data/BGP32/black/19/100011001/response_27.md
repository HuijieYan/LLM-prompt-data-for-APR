Based on the provided information and analysis of the failing test cases, the bug seems to be related to the logic for handling the number of newlines to insert before a line. The issue arises when determining the number of newlines to insert based on certain conditions, such as decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements.

The current implementation does not correctly handle all these cases and might be incorrectly calculating the number of newlines to insert, leading to incorrect formatting and failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the number of newlines should be different based on the context (decorators, imports, yields, etc.).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not self.previous_defs:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Please replace the buggy function with the corrected version provided above. The changes include adjusting the condition checks, handling empty line insertions, and properly updating the `previous_defs` list.

After applying these changes, rerun the failing tests to ensure that the corrected function passes the test cases.
