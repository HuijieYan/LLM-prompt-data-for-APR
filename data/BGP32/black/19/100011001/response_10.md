### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines in the code. The function is designed to determine whether to insert empty lines based on the characteristics of the current line and the previous line. However, the conditions and assignments inside the function are not serving the intended purpose, leading to incorrect output.

From the runtime values and types of input parameters and variables, we can see that the function is not appropriately handling cases where empty lines should be inserted or not.

- In Case 1, the function should have returned `(0, 0)` to avoid inserting empty lines, but instead, it returned `(2, 0)`.
- In Case 2, the function should have returned `(0, 0)` to avoid inserting empty lines, but instead, it returned `(2, 0)`.
- In Case 3, the function should have returned `(0, 0)` to avoid inserting empty lines, but instead, it returned `(2, 0)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions and assignments within the function to correctly handle cases where empty lines should be inserted. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function returns the appropriate tuple `(before, newline)` based on the conditions defined.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
    
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By ensuring that the conditions are correctly evaluated and the variables are appropriately updated, the corrected version of the function should now provide the expected behavior based on the input parameters and conditions.
