### Bug Analysis
The bug is related to the handling of empty lines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions like depth, decorators, flow controls, imports, etc.

The bug seems to be with the logic for inserting empty lines before a line that is not a decorator but is followed by a line that is a decorator. The function currently returns `0, 0` in this case, which is causing the test failure as the expected output has empty lines between the non-decorator line and the decorator line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert when encountering a non-decorator line followed by a decorator line. The correct behavior should be to return the appropriate number of empty lines in this scenario.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 1, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and not is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly handle the case where a non-decorator line precedes a decorator line, ensuring the correct number of empty lines are inserted.
