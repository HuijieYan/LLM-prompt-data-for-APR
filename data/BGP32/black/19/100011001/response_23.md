### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to an incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted. The function logic is making decisions based on the conditions of the current line, including whether it's a decorator, definition, flow control, import, or yield line. However, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in each case is flawed. This is causing the function to return incorrect values, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully review each case and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified in the function. We also need to consider the existing state of the `previous_defs` list and the previous line to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic and the return values in each case, the corrected version of the function should now return the appropriate number of empty lines according to the given conditions. This should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
