The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines and indentation levels in the provided code. The function determines whether to insert empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current line's characteristics like depth, leaves, decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

### Bug Explanation:
- The function seems to incorrectly handle the calculation of `newlines` based on the conditions related to decorators and empty lines.
- The way `before` is handled in certain conditions seems to be incorrect, leading to discrepancies in handling empty lines before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the calculation of `newlines` to accurately determine the number of empty lines needed based on different conditions.
2. Correct the handling of `before` variable to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted before the current line based on the given conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the conditions correctly and pass the failing test cases.
