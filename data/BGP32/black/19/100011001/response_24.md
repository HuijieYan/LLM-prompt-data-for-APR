### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line in the context of code formatting. The function analyzes the current line based on various conditions such as depth, presence of leaves, decorators, imports, and flow control statements.

From the error message provided, it seems that the output of the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines between comments within decorators. This leads to a failure in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator`. The specific issue seems to be related to how the function handles comments and decorators in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic in the function to properly handle the insertion of empty lines before comments within decorators.
2. Ensure that the conditions for inserting empty lines are correctly evaluated based on the context of the current line and the previous line.
3. Consider the specific cases mentioned in the failing test case and adjust the return values accordingly to pass the test.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.leaves and not current_line.comments:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators unless there are comments.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the function to consider the presence of comments within decorators and adjusting the conditions for inserting empty lines, the corrected version provided above should address the issue observed in the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
