The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic used to determine the number of empty lines to insert in the output. Based on the input parameters and the runtime values provided, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the cases where empty lines should be inserted.

### Bug in the Function:
- In Case 1, when `current_line.is_decorator` is True, the function is returning 2 newlines even though it should only return 1 based on the logic.
- In Case 2, the function is incorrectly returning 2 newlines when inserting empty lines before the first line in the file, but it should not insert any empty lines.
- In Case 7, the function is not determining the correct number of empty lines to insert based on the function's definition.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on the conditions provided in the function.
- Ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where empty lines should not be inserted or where a specific number of empty lines should be inserted.
- Update the return statements in the function to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the function, it should now correctly handle the cases where empty lines need to be inserted. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
