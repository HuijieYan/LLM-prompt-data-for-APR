### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions involving the current line and the previous line. The function seems to have a logic issue where it does not correctly calculate the number of empty lines in some scenarios, leading to failed tests.

1. In Case 1, the function should insert 2 empty lines before `@property` due to the decorator's presence, but it returns `0, 0`.
2. In Case 2, the function should insert 2 empty lines because the previous line is a decorator, but it returns `0, 0`.
3. In Case 6, the function should insert only 1 empty line before the `.property` line, but it returns `2, 0`.

The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, yields, and the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on these conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review the conditions and logic in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` that determine the number of empty lines to insert. Specifically, we should focus on the conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields as they are the likely culprits causing incorrect behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        same_depth_previous_line = self.previous_line and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_decorator or same_depth_previous_line:
            newlines = 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 0
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        same_depth = self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
        before = 0 if same_depth else 1
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        same_depth = self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth
        before = 0 if same_depth else 1
        return before, 0

    return max_allowed, 0 if not newlines else 2
```

This corrected version includes improved condition handling for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure correct calculation of the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to validate the fix.
