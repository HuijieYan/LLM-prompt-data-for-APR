### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic where it determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. In some cases, the function incorrectly returns the number of empty lines to be inserted, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

### Bug Location
The bug is mainly caused by the incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which is supposed to track the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated and returned based on the conditions defined in the function.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for updating the `before` variable and returning the correct number of empty lines based on the given conditions, this corrected version of the function should now align with the expected behavior and pass the failing tests.
