### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function leads to incorrect handling of empty lines in specific cases, resulting in failing tests that check the formatting of code lines. The function is responsible for determining if and how many empty lines should be inserted between code lines. 

The function's logic includes various conditions based on the characteristics of the `current_line` being processed, such as its depth, presence of decorators, flow control statements, imports, yields, and whether it marks the start of a new class or function definition. 

From the runtime values of the input parameters and the variables before returning, it is evident that the function is not correctly considering all these conditions consistently in different scenarios. The incorrect handling results in the assertion errors when comparing the expected and actual formatted code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to carefully review each condition in the function and ensure that it correctly addresses the respective cases without conflicting with other conditions. Additionally, we should make sure to account for all possible scenarios that could affect the insertion of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
After analyzing the bug and considering the various cases, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the inconsistencies and errors in handling empty line insertion and ensure the function behaves as intended, passing the failing tests related to code formatting. Feel free to test the corrected function to verify the fix.
