The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. From the analysis of the provided cases and the function itself, here are the identified issues:

1. The condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` is problematic because it sets `before` to a fixed value (`1` if `depth` is truthy, `2` otherwise), which might not be appropriate for all cases. This condition should be revised to handle the `before` value more accurately.

2. The logic surrounding the cases for decorators, function definitions, and class definitions seems to be overcomplicated and may lead to incorrect results. These conditions need to be reviewed and simplified to ensure correct behavior.

3. The handling of `previous_line` and its properties needs to be adjusted to consider different scenarios properly.

To fix the issues mentioned above, we need to revise the logic of the function. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected version, unnecessary or incorrect conditions have been removed, the handling of decorators, definitions, and other cases has been simplified, and the logic has been adjusted to ensure correct behavior. This corrected version should address the identified issues and pass the failing tests.
