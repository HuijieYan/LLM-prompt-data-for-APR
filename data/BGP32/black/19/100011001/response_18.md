### Bug Analysis:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle adding empty lines based on certain conditions in the source code. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the current line properties. The function seems to be inconsistent in determining the number of empty lines to be inserted in some cases due to incorrect logic.

1. In Case 1, when `current_line.is_decorator` is True, the function should return `0, 0` to avoid inserting empty lines. However, the current logic seems to return `newlines, 0` which is incorrect.

2. In Case 2, a similar issue persists where when `current_line.is_decorator` is False, the function should return `0, 0`, but it processes differently leading to the incorrect number of empty lines.

3. In Case 6, even though `current_line.is_decorator` is True, the number of empty lines to be inserted is calculated incorrectly, resulting in failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bugs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, consider the following improvements:
1. Refactor the logic related to determining the number of empty lines to be inserted to ensure consistency.
2. Adjust the conditional checks to correctly handle scenarios when empty lines should not be inserted based on the source code structure.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines according to the specified conditions, which will resolve the failing test cases.
