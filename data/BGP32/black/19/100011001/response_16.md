### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to how it handles the insertion of empty lines. The function is incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines to insert based on the current line's attributes, such as whether it is a decorator, a class definition, a flow control statement, etc. This leads to incorrect behavior and mismatched output, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the logic where the function determines the number of empty lines to insert based on various conditions of the `current_line`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of newlines insertion based on the attributes of the `current_line`. This inconsistency leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines, causing the test cases to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the logic used to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the attributes of the `current_line`. We should ensure that the logic is correct and consistent across all scenarios.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to ensure proper handling of the empty line insertion based on the attributes of the `current_line`. It addresses the inconsistencies and should now pass the failing test cases.
