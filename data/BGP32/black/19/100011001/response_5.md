### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the indentation depth when determining the number of empty lines to add. The function is not correctly maintaining the `max_allowed` value based on the indentation level and is not adjusting the number of newlines to insert accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `max_allowed` variable is set correctly based on the indentation level. Additionally, we should adjust the logic for adding empty lines to consider the current line's properties such as being a decorator, def, class, flow control, or import statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle the indentation level and considering the properties of the current line, the corrected function should now output the expected number of empty lines based on the provided test cases.
