### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to analyze the current line and return the number of empty lines to be inserted before it.
2. In Case 1 and Case 2, the function fails to handle the case where the previous line is a decorator and doesn't insert empty lines.
3. In Case 7, the function incorrectly appends the current line's depth to `self.previous_defs` list even if it's not a decorator.
4. The function has logical issues in handling different types of lines like decorators and flow control statements, resulting in incorrect empty line insertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check whether the current line is a decorator or not. If it is, handle the insertion of empty lines accordingly.
2. Modify the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the type of the current line and the previous line.
3. Update the handling of depth and decorators logic to ensure correct empty line insertions in all cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the function, it should now correctly handle different types of lines and insert empty lines according to the specified conditions.
