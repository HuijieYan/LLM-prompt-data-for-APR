### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before a certain line in the formatted code. The function should handle different scenarios based on the type of the current line, such as decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yield statements.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, the function is incorrectly setting the `newlines` value when the condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` is met. In this case, the function should not return 2 newlines if the `current_line.depth` is not zero.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, you should correct the logic that determines the number of newlines to insert based on the conditions specified in the function. Update the logic for setting the `newlines` variable to handle different scenarios properly. Ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the conditions for decorators, definitions, and classes.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield \
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for setting the `newlines` variable within the conditions where decorators, definitions, and classes are handled, the corrected function should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test cases.
