The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The function incorrectly checks `current_line.is_import`, thinking it is a boolean attribute of `current_line`. However, `is_import` is actually a function from the same file that should be called with `current_line` as an argument to determine if the current line is an import statement.
2. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line seems to be incorrect in some cases based on the provided runtime values and types.
3. The handling of `self.previous_defs` and the conditions related to inserting empty lines might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the following improvements can be made:
- Call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` as an argument to determine if the current line is an import statement.
- Refactor the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the different conditions that need to be checked.
- Ensure that the handling of `self.previous_defs` is correct and that the conditions for inserting empty lines are accurately implemented.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    is_import_line = is_import(current_line)
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    else:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and is_import_line and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues discussed and should provide more accurate handling of empty lines before and after the current line.
