### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. In particular, the issue arises when handling the case where the previous line is an import statement.

In the buggy function, the condition to check whether the previous line is an import statement is incorrectly written as `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, the `is_import` function is defined outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class and takes a `Leaf` object as input, not a `Line` object. Thus, the `is_import` function cannot be directly called on the `previous_line` object within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to correct the condition that checks if the previous line is an import statement by calling the `is_import` function correctly.
2. Import the required classes/objects within the `EmptyLineTracker` class to use the `is_import` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0])  # Corrected check for import statement
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the suggested corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should function correctly and handle the cases where the previous line is an import statement appropriately.
