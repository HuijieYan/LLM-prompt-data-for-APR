### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line. The bug is specifically in the check for previous lines being imports, which is causing incorrect behavior in certain cases.

In the function, the logic for handling when the previous line is an import is flawed. The condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is being called as if `is_import` is an attribute of the `Line` class, which is incorrect. `is_import` is actually a separate function defined outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which is used to determine if a given line is an import. Due to this incorrect usage of `is_import`, the function is misguided in its decision-making.

The issue arises because `self.previous_line.is_import` should actually be `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly determine if the previous line is an import line.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, you need to modify the line where the issue occurs within the function. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as the argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected usage of is_import function
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly call the `is_import` function to determine if the previous line is an import line, resolving the bug in the logic.
