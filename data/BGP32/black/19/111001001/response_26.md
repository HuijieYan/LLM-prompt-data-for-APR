### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. However, there is a bug in the function related to the handling of `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the buggy function, there is a conditional check that compares `self.previous_line.is_import` with `current_line.is_import`. However, the function has defined `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` outside the class. Hence, the correct way to call the `is_import` function is `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`.
2. Due to this incorrect comparison, the function always falls back to the generic return statement `(before, 0)`, resulting in incorrect behavior when handling imports.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to correctly call the `is_import` function for `self.previous_line`. By updating this comparison, we can ensure that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines needed based on the import-related conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the suggested correction in the function, the bug related to incorrect handling of imports will be fixed, and the function will be able to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed based on the defined conditions.
