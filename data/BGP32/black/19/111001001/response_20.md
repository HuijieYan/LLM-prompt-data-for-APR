The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect logic when handling the `before` value and updating the empty lines before the current line. 

The issue arises when the function tries to determine the number of empty lines before the current line based on different conditions. In some cases, the logic does not correctly calculate the required number of empty lines before the line, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for calculating the `before` value based on the conditions provided and ensure that the variable is updated appropriately for each case.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the incorrect handling of the `before` value and ensures that the correct number of empty lines are inserted before the current line based on the given conditions.
