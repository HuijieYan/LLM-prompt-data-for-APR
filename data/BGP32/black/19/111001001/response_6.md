### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. Based on the provided runtime values and types, it can be observed that the function is not correctly determining the number of newlines to insert based on certain conditions like decorators, imports, and yields.

1. In Case 2, the `is_decorator` condition is evaluated as `False` even when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, leading to incorrect newline insertion behavior.
2. In Case 5, the condition involving previous line being an import and current line not being an import is not functioning properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the conditions for decorators, imports, and yields are properly checked and handled to determine the correct number of newlines to insert.
2. Check the logic related to `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` flags to accurately determine the required newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_import = is_import(current_line)
    is_yield = current_line.is_yield
    depth = current_line.depth

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_import:

        if depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return min(1, self.previous_after), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return min(1, self.previous_after), 0

    return 0, 0
```

### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the condition for checking decorators.
2. Fixed the condition for checking imports.
3. Updated the condition for checking yields.
