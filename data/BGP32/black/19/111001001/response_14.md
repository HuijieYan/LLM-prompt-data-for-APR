### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there is a bug in the function that causes incorrect behavior under certain conditions. The bug occurs in the following block of code:
```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0
```
The issue lies in the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`, which is meant to check if the previous line was an import statement. However, the `is_import` function is not called correctly within the `if` condition. Instead, it should be called as `is_import(self.previous_line)`. This leads to the function always returning `0` for both the number of lines before and after the processed line in scenarios where this condition should be true, causing incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `is_import` function should be called properly within the condition. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected function call
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the function call to `is_import(self.previous_line)` within the `if` condition, the function should now correctly handle the scenarios involving import statements and return the appropriate number of empty lines before and after the processed line.
