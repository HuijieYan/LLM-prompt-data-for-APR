### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional check for the previous line being an import. The buggy code contains a condition that checks if `self.previous_line` is an import by directly calling `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, `is_import` is actually a standalone function, not a member function of `Line`, hence the error.

### Bug Explanation
In the given buggy function, the line `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect. The function `is_import` is defined outside the `Line` class, so it cannot be directly called on `self.previous_line`. This causes a runtime error when this check is attempted. The condition checking for a previous line being an import should be reviewed and updated.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should update the condition that checks if the previous line was an import in a way that reflects the actual mechanism defined in the code.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The bug is fixed by replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function passing in `self.previous_line` as a parameter. This way, the correct condition for checking if the previous line is an import is implemented.
