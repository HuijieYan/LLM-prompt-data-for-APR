### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from not correctly updating the `before` value based on certain conditions, resulting in incorrect return values. Specifically, the issue occurs when processing lines related to imports, yielding inconsistent empty line behavior.

1. In Case 2, when the `current_line` is a comment line (e.g., '# TODO: X'), the `is_import` function isn't directly called, leading to incorrect `is_import` evaluation inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

2. In Case 3 and Case 5, the previous line is not an import line, but the current line is. Due to this, the logic to determine the number of empty lines returns the wrong values.

3. In Case 6, when processing a line related to imports (e.g., '@property'), the empty line logic doesn't consider the depth of the line properly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix
To address the bug, it is crucial to enhance the `_maybe_empty_lines` function's conditional logic related to import lines. We need to ensure that the correct check is performed based on the import status of the current and previous lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    # Check if the line is related to imports
    is_current_line_import = is_import(current_line)
    is_previous_line_import = self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line)

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_current_line_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth and not is_previous_line_import:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes an additional check to properly handle the import line scenarios, which were causing the incorrect empty line behavior.
