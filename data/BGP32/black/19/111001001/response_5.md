### Bug analysis
The bug lies in the logic of determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. Specifically, the conditions for handling decorators, functions, and imports are not properly evaluated, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Error location
The bug is mainly located in the logic that handles decorators, functions, and imports. The lines that are causing the issues are:
```python
if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
...
if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
...
if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
```

### Cause of the bug
1. When processing a line that is a decorator, function, or class definition, the logic does not correctly track their occurrences and adjust the empty line count accordingly.
2. Handling imports incorrectly compares the depth of the previous line and the current line to determine if an empty line should be inserted.

### Bug fix strategy
1. Properly track and handle decorators, functions, and classes to insert the right number of empty lines.
2. Adjust the condition for handling imports to ensure correct placement of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
            
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
                
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```
By updating the conditions related to decorators, functions, classes, and imports, the corrected function should now properly insert empty lines based on the sequence of lines being processed.
