### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional checks related to the `is_import` attribute in the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. The buggy logic tries to access `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming they are boolean attributes, but the `is_import` function is actually a separate function that should be called to check if the object is an import, not an attribute.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the current implementation, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` in the second-to-last if statement is incorrect. It should instead call `is_import(self.previous_line)` to utilize the `is_import` function properly.
   
2. Similarly, the condition `current_line.is_import` in the previous if statement should also use `is_import(current_line)` to check if the current line is an import correctly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, update the conditional checks for `is_import` calls:

```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and is_import(self.previous_line)
    and not is_import(current_line)
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0

if (
    self.previous_line
    and is_import(self.previous_line)
    and (not is_import(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
):
    return (before or 1), 0
```

By replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` and `is_import(current_line)` respectively, we ensure that the correct function is called to determine if the line represents an import statement.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_import(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the import-related conditional checks and avoid the bug previously causing incorrect behavior.
