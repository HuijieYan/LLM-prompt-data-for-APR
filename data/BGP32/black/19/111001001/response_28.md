The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the condition that checks whether the `self.previous_line` attribute is an import by calling `self.previous_line.is_import`. The issue is that `is_import` is a standalone function and not part of the `Line` class, so it cannot be directly called like a class method.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
- Since the `is_import` function is defined outside the `Line` class and is being incorrectly called within `_maybe_empty_lines`, we need to find an alternative way to check if the previous line was an import.
- We can pass the `self.previous_line` object to the `is_import` function as an argument to determine if it is an import.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In the suggested correction, the `is_import` function is imported at the top of the file and then used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line was an import. This modification should address the bug and make the function work as intended.
