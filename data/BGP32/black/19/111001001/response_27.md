### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The issue arises from incorrectly checking if the `self.previous_line` object has the attribute `is_import`. Since `self.previous_line` is an instance of the `Line` class, it doesn't have the `is_import` attribute. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` in the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the absence of the `is_import` attribute. We can achieve this by checking if `self.previous_line` exists and if it has an attribute `is_import` before accessing it. If the attribute is missing, we can safely assume it is not an import line.

### Updated Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import') and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield') and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function includes a check for the existence of the `is_import` attribute before accessing it on `self.previous_line`. If the attribute is missing, it skips the check and proceeds with the logic. This modification should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
