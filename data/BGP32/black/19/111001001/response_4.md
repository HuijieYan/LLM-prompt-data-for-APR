### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrect handling of the conditions related to inserting empty lines before and after the current line. The function checks various conditions based on the properties of the current and previous lines, such as whether the current line is a decorator, a flow control statement, an import, a yield statement, etc. These conditions determine the number of empty lines to be inserted both before and after the current line.

In multiple cases, the conditions for inserting empty lines are not properly evaluated, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the logic for checking if the previous line is an import or a yield statement does not consider the fact that these conditions are determined based on function calls `is_import` and `is_yield` respectively, which are not directly referenced in the function. This inaccuracy leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines in some scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the conditions for inserting empty lines are properly evaluated based on the properties of the current and previous lines. Specifically, we should fix the cases where the function incorrectly handles imports and yield statements. We will consider the actual values of `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` by calling the appropriate functions `is_import` and `is_yield` respectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the conditions related to imports and yield statements with function calls to `is_import` and `is_yield` respectively to accurately determine the properties of the current and previous lines. This ensures that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after each line based on the actual properties of the lines.
