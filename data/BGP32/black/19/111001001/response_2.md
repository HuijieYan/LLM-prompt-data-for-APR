### Bug in the Function

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect logic related to tracking empty lines before and after a given line. This logic is complex due to various conditions based on the characteristics of the input `current_line` and the previous lines.

### Issues Identified
1. In the case where `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class` is True, the function should handle the case where `depth` is 0 separately.
2. In the condition where the current line is not an import (`current_line.is_import`) and the previous line was an import (`self.previous_line.is_import`), the logic does not consider the scenario where `before` can be overridden by the logic.
3. The condition involving `self.previous_defs` to check for decorators is not handling the scenario correctly, especially in the case where `depth` is 0.
4. The logic to determine the number of newlines when `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class` is True is not considering the case when `is_decorator` is False.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Separate the logic for handling `current_line.is_def` and `current_line.is_class` when `depth` is 0.
2. Adjust the condition for handling the number of newlines when decorators are present.
3. Update the logic that checks for previous imports to handle the scenario where `before` might be overridden.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
        if current_line.is_def and current_line.depth == 0:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        if before == 0:
            before = 1
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        if before == 0:
            before = 1
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and should now handle the various scenarios correctly based on the input parameters provided to the function.
