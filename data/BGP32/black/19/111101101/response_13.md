The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic related to handling previous line attributes and determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. Specifically, the bug occurs when checking if the previous line is an import or contains a yield statement. The function incorrectly tries to access the `is_import` attribute of the `self.previous_line`. However, `is_import` is a function and not an attribute of the `Line` class.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_import` function from the `black.py` file and pass the `self.previous_line` as an argument to properly determine if the previous line was an import.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Fix: Call the is_import function to check if the previous line is an import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield()
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the bug by calling the `is_import` function appropriately to check if the previous line is an import. The same approach is applied to check for the presence of yield statements in the previous line. This modification ensures that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the specified conditions.
