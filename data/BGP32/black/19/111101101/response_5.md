The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines to return based on the current and previous lines. The function is not correctly handling the conditions for decorators, import statements, and yields, resulting in incorrect return values.

The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic for determining the number of empty lines to return based on the specific characteristics of the current and previous lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    newlines = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    else:
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            if current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                newlines = 2
            else:
                newlines = 1

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

    return newlines, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and properly handle the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on the characteristics of the current and previous lines.
