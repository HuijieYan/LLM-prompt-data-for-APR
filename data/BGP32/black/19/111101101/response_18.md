## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several conditions that determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line being processed. One of the conditions checks if the `previous_line` is an import statement (using `self.previous_line.is_import`) and the current line is not an import statement. 

However, the bug lies in the comparison of `self.previous_line.is_import` which should be `is_import(self.previous_line)` since the function `is_import` is defined to check if a leaf is an import. This incorrect comparison results in the buggy behavior and failing test cases.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` in the buggy function should be replaced with a call to the `is_import` function like `is_import(self.previous_line)`. This change ensures that the correct check for an import statement is performed, and the function behaves as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and behave as expected.
