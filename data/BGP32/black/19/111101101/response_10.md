The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrect handling of the `depth` variable and not updating the `current_line` correctly based on specific conditions. The function fails to consider the depth when determining the number of newlines to insert, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to properly update the logic based on the current line's characteristics and ensure that the `depth` is considered when setting the number of newlines to insert. Additionally, we need to address the incorrect assignment of `before` value in certain scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the cases mentioned and address the issues that caused the failing test cases. It ensures that the depth is taken into account when determining the number of newlines to insert and correctly updates the necessary variables based on the conditions specified.
