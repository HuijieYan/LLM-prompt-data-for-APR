## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is failing because it incorrectly handles the logic to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The function fails to correctly handle some conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control statements, leading to incorrect behavior and failing the provided test cases.

### Issues Identified
1. The handling of previous line being an import is incorrect, leading to wrong return values.
2. Decorators are not handled properly when determining the number of empty lines.
3. Flow control statements are not considered when calculating the number of empty lines.
4. The logic to update `before` value and `previous_defs` list is faulty.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for handling the previous line being an import to properly adjust the number of empty lines.
2. Correct the logic for handling decorators to ensure correct empty line placement.
3. Include proper handling of flow control statements to adjust the number of empty lines.
4. Ensure correct updates to the `before` variable and `previous_defs` list based on conditions.

## Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

By updating the logic as described in the bug fix strategy, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should now handle the conditions correctly and pass the failing test cases.
