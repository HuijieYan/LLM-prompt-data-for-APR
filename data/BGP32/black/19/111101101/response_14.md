## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the usage of the `is_import` attribute with `self.previous_line`, which is not accurate. `self.previous_line` is an instance of the `Line` class and does not have an `is_import` attribute.

### Issue in the Bug:
The problematic part of the function is:
```python
if self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
```
Here, `self.previous_line.is_import` tries to access an attribute `is_import` on `self.previous_line` which is a `Line` object, not a function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

### Error Cause:
The error is caused by incorrect attribute access on `self.previous_line` which leads to the function trying to access `is_import` on a `Line` object. This causes the AttributeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where `self.previous_line` is checked for `is_import`. We can create a separate function that checks if a line is an import and use that function to determine the import status at `self.previous_line`.

## Code Fix
```python
def is_line_import(line: Line) -> bool:
    # Implement the logic to check if the line is an import
    if line.leaves and line.leaves[0].type == TOKEN.NAME and line.leaves[0].value == "import":
        return True
    return False

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_line_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By introducing the `is_line_import` function that checks if a line is an import, we avoid the AttributeError caused by incorrectly accessing the `is_import` attribute on a `Line` object. This fix should resolve the bug and make the function operate as intended.
