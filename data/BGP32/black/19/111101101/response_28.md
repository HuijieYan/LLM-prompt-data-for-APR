## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to incorrect handling of the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` object.

In the buggy function, there is a conditional check for `current_line.is_import`, which is expected to be a boolean value determining if the current line is an import statement. However, in the code provided, `current_line.is_import` is not a direct attribute of the `current_line` object but rather a function call `current_line.is_import` which doesn't exist.

Because of this incorrect attribute access, the conditional check `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` will always fail to execute as intended, leading to unexpected behavior in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check `current_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function correctly, passing the `current_line` object as an argument. This will ensure that the correct behavior is implemented based on the state of the current line being an import statement.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Corrected the check to call is_import function
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the correct function call to `is_import` where needed, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function ensures that the is_import check is performed accurately based on the behavior defined in the `is_import` function.
