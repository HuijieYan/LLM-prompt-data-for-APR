### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect comparison of `current_line.is_import` to check if the line is an import line. The function relies on `current_line.is_import`, but the property `is_import` on the current_line object does not exist. Instead, it should call the independent function `is_import` passing the `current_line` object to determine if the line is an import line.

Additionally, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function affects the logic flow and leads to incorrect decisions regarding how many empty lines should be inserted before and after the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Replace `current_line.is_import` with a call to `is_import(current_line)` to check if the current line is an import line.
2. Adjust the logic based on the result obtained from the `is_import` function to determine how many empty lines should be inserted correctly.
3. Update the function to properly handle cases where the line is an import line or contains imports.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    # Check if the current line is an import line
    is_import_line = is_import(current_line)
    
    if is_import_line:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
    
    # Handle other cases based on line types
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on the line type, as determined by the `is_import` function.
