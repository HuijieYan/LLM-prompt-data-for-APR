### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises due to the incorrect comparison between the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` and `previous_line`. The buggy function tries to access the `is_import` attribute directly from the `previous_line`, assuming it is a boolean attribute, but in reality, it is a method `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:` that needs to be called for proper comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` method is called correctly on the `previous_line` before comparing it with the `current_line`. This will properly evaluate whether the previous line is an import or not.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_previous_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_previous_line_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By modifying the comparison of the `is_import` attribute in the corrected function to properly call the `is_import` method on the `previous_line`, we ensure that the function correctly determines whether the previous line is an import statement or not. This correction should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in all test cases.
