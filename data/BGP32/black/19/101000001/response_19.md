## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line of code. It considers various conditions such as depth, presence of leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to decide the number of empty lines.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function is incorrectly checking `current_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function to determine if the current line is an import statement.
2. The logic for handling imports and yielding may not be correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert.
3. The conditions for handling decorators and other types of lines may need to be revisited for correct behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current code arises from using `current_line.is_import` directly instead of calling the `is_import` function to determine if the line is an import. This error causes the function to misunderstand whether the current line is an import or not, leading to incorrect decisions regarding the number of empty lines to insert.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should call the `is_import` function to accurately determine if the current line is an import statement. Additionally, we need to ensure that the conditions for handling decorators, imports, yields, and other types of lines are correctly implemented to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `is_import` function is called when checking if the current and previous lines are import statements. This change ensures that the correct logic is applied to determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the line types.
