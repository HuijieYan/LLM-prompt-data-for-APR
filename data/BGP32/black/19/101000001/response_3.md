Based on the provided buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, it seems to be related to managing empty lines in the code. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

The potential error locations in the function can be:
1. The condition `if current_line.is_import` is incorrect as there is no method `is_import` defined directly on `current_line`. It seems like this condition should call the `is_import` function from the related functions.
2. In the snippet `if (before or 1)`, the intention might have been to check if `before` is 0 and if so, return 1. However, Python's "or" operator does not behave the same way as in some other languages, so this may not work as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the function tries to access `is_import` as an attribute of `current_line`, but it should be called as a separate function. Additionally, the logical operators used to set the default value of `before` may not have the desired effect.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the condition related to `is_import` to call the `is_import` function properly.
2. Modify the logic for setting the value of `before` when determining the number of empty lines to insert.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before if before else 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before if before else 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the condition related to `is_import` has been updated to call the `is_import` function correctly. The logic for setting the default value of `before` has been modified to behave as expected.
