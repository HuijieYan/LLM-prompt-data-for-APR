### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line in the code. It checks various conditions based on the current line and the previous line to decide on the number of empty lines.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the line:
```python
if self.previous_line.is_import
```
Here, the function is trying to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line`, assuming that `self.previous_line` has an `is_import` attribute. However, the correct approach should be to call the `is_import` function defined in the helper module to validate if the current line is an import or not.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by directly accessing an attribute that does not exist on the `self.previous_line` object, leading to an AttributeError as the `is_import` attribute is not directly defined on `self.previous_line`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the line `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import line using the `is_import` helper function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
