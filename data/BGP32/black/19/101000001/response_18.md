## Analysis:
1. The `is_import` function is used within the buggy function to check if a line is an import.
2. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling empty lines based on specific conditions related to the current line and the previous line.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrectly handling the condition to check for imports (`current_line.is_import`). The buggy function is trying to access the `is_import` attribute directly from the `current_line` object, but it should call the `is_import` function instead.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where it checks for imports to call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` as the argument.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_import_line = is_import(current_line)  # Call the is_import function to check if it is an import line
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not is_import_line
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the modification highlighted in the code snippet above, we can ensure that the function correctly checks for import lines using the `is_import` function rather than directly accessing the attribute from the `current_line` object.
