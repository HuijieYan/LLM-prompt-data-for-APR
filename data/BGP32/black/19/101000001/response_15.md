### Analyzing the buggy function:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to determine if empty lines need to be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions. It operates on the `current_line` object and assesses various attributes of the line to decide the number of empty lines to insert.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The use of `self.previous_line.is_import` seems incorrect as `is_import` is a standalone function, not a method of `Line`.
2. There is inconsistency in handling the `is_import` condition check and the usage of the `is_import` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The function expects `current_line` and `previous_line` to have specific attribute values (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, etc.) for conditional checks. The `is_import` condition check references the method `is_import` directly on `self.previous_line`, which is not a valid reference.

### Suggested bug-fix strategy:
1. Modify the condition related to `is_import` to use the standalone `is_import` function properly without assuming it as a method of `Line`.
2. Check and ensure consistent usage of `is_import` throughout the function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_import` function is invoked properly instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`.
- The usage of `is_import` is made consistent.
- Other parts of the function remain intact.
