## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several conditional blocks to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. However, there is a bug related to the `self.previous_line.is_import` condition. The current implementation refers to `self.previous_line.is_import` as a method, but it should actually use the `is_import` function defined in the same file to check if the previous line is an import.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from using `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of the correct function `is_import(self.previous_line)` to determine if the previous line is an import. This results in a runtime error as `is_import` is not a method of the class containing `_maybe_empty_lines`.

## Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to call the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as an argument to determine if the previous line is an import.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import` function is invoked correctly with `self.previous_line` as an argument to check if the previous line is an import. This change fixes the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
