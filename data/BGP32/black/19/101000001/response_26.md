### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function defines the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.
2. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function interacts with attributes of the `current_line` object and properties/methods of related objects such as `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, and `current_line` properties like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.
3. One potential error in the current implementation is the incorrect usage of the `is_import` method. The `is_import` method is intended to be called as `current_line.is_import` instead of `self.previous_line.is_import` in the buggy function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect reference to `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of `current_line.is_import`, which leads to the improper comparison of whether the previous line was an import or not.

### Fix Strategy:
Replace the incorrect reference to `self.previous_line.is_import` with the correct reference `current_line.is_import` to ensure that the comparison between the previous line being an import and the current line being an import is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and current_line.is_import
        and not self.previous_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
