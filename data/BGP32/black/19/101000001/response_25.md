## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert between two lines of code based on certain conditions. The function seems to be encountering an issue when checking for `self.previous_line.is_import`. The problem lies in the usage of `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line`, which should actually be calling the `is_import` function defined in the same file.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the current implementation arises from mistakenly referencing `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function to check if the previous line is an import statement. Due to this error, the conditional logic based on whether the previous line is an import statement is not functioning correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `is_import` function defined in the same file to determine if the `previous_line` is an import statement. This can be achieved by replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to ensure that the correct function is called for the comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly call the `is_import` function for checking if the previous line is an import statement. This change ensures that the comparison is made using the intended function and fixes the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
