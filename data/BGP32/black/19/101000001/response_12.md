## Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the function `is_import` being called within the `maybe_empty_lines` function. The bug occurs when checking if the `self.previous_line` is an import, causing an AttributeError due to accessing the `is_import` function as an attribute on `self.previous_line`.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the line `self.previous_line.is_import`. The `is_import` function is defined independently in the module and is not associated with the `Line` class. As a result, attempting to access it as an attribute of `self.previous_line` causes an AttributeError due to the nonexistence of the function in the `Line` class.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to modify the condition involving `self.previous_line.is_import`. We should check the condition separately by calling the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument, rather than accessing it as an attribute.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` in the condition where the bug was identified. This change ensures that the `is_import` function is called correctly to validate if the previous line is an import.
