## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines in a code formatting context.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine whether to insert empty lines.
3. The bug seems to be related to the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` as it calls the `is_import` function from another part of the code that checks if a leaf is an import statement.

## Error Location:
The error seems to be in the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` where `is_import` should be called as a method of `self.previous_line` but instead, it is being accessed directly as a property.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because `self.previous_line.is_import` is trying to access a non-existent property `is_import` directly on `self.previous_line` instead of calling it properly as a method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` function is correctly called as a method of `self.previous_line` to properly check if the previous line is an import statement.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import` function is correctly called within the condition checking if the previous line is an import statement. This should fix the bug related to checking import statements in the context of empty line insertion.
