## Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `self` parameter, indicating it is a method within a class.
2. The function interacts with attributes of the instance through `self`, implying that it belongs to a class with its own state.
3. The function interacts with other methods or functions defined in the same file, such as `is_import`.
4. The function checks various conditions related to line properties to determine how many empty lines to insert.

## Identified Bugs:
1. The function is referencing `current_line.is_import`, assuming it is a property/method of the `current_line` object. However, the `is_import` logic is defined in the `is_import` function, not directly as a property of `current_line`.
2. There is a mix-up between the `is_import` method from the `current_line` object and the standalone `is_import` function in the same file.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the confusion between the `is_import` function from the standalone function and the method call `current_line.is_import`, which is not a valid property of `current_line` based on the given code.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the usage of `is_import` in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to directly call the standalone `is_import` function instead of trying to access it as a property of `current_line`.
2. Correct the logic to use the correct source of information for checking if a line is an import.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import` function is called directly when checking the import status of lines, eliminating the use of non-existent properties on the `current_line` object.
