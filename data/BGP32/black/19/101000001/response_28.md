## Fixing the Bug in the _maybe_empty_lines Function

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line in a code block. It checks various conditions based on the type of the current line and the relationship with the previous line to decide the number of empty lines.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function tries to access `current_line.is_import`, assuming that it is a property of the `current_line` object. However, the `is_import` check is supposed to be done based on the type of the leaf in the current line, which is done in the `is_import` method from the `Leaf` class.
2. The condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is not correct, as the `is_import` check is supposed to be called as a function `is_import(self.previous_line)` to determine if the previous line is an import statement.

### Cause of the Bug:
The errors in the function arise from confusing the attributes and functions associated with the `current_line` and `previous_line` objects, leading to incorrect checks and conditions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. To fix the bug, we need to properly utilize the `is_import` function to check if a given leaf in the current line represents an import statement.
2. The check for import statements associated with the `previous_line` should be corrected by calling the `is_import` method with the `previous_line` object as a parameter.

### Corrected Version of the _maybe_empty_lines Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary:
By fixing the usage of `is_import` on leaf objects and correcting the import statement check for the `previous_line`, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should now work as intended to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line in the code block.
