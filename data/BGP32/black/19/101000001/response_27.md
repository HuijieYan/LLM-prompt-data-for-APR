## Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `current_line` as input and based on certain conditions, determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.
2. The function interacts with attributes of the class instance it belongs to, like `previous_defs`, `previous_line`, and also calls the `is_import` function from the same file.
3. The bug is likely to be related to how `is_import` is used within the function, specifically in the condition where it checks if the `previous_line` is an import.
4. The function seems to be missing a proper check for the `is_import` condition which may result in inconsistency.

## Bug Cause:
The bug lies in the conditional check `self.previous_line.is_import` which is trying to access a method `is_import` directly on an object (`self.previous_line`) without actually calling the `is_import` function. This is causing the function to fail to recognize the `is_import` condition correctly.

## Fix Strategy:
Instead of directly checking `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should call the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as the argument to properly determine if it is an import line or not.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Call the is_import function to properly check if the previous line is an import
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
