## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that should be added before the current line in the context of code formatting. The function relies on various conditions to decide the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.

## Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` may cause an error as `is_import` is not a property or method of `Line` class.
2. The condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` may not assign the correct value to `before` variable as it may not convert `depth` to boolean as intended.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the original function arises from attempting to access an attribute (`is_import`) on `self.previous_line` which is not defined within the `Line` class.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition related to `is_import` to ensure it is correctly checking the type of the current line.
2. Refactor the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` to handle the conversion of depth to boolean correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version, the check for `is_import` is updated to use `hasattr` to avoid potential errors related to the attribute not being present. Additionally, the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` remains intact as depth should be correctly converted to boolean as per the intended logic.
