### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions.
2. The function interacts with attributes and methods of the class it belongs to (`self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, etc.).
3. There is a potential bug in the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` as `is_import` is a function, not an attribute of `Line`.
4. The function needs to correctly handle conditions for inserting empty lines based on line types, depth, and previous lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to access `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line` which doesn't exist, leading to an AttributeError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `self.previous_line` is not None before accessing its attributes.
2. Modify the condition involving `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function instead.
3. Ensure correct handling of various scenarios to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly call the `is_import` function. This modification ensures proper handling of line types and conditions for inserting empty lines.
