There are two potential error locations in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

1. In the conditional check `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` where `is_import` is being used as an attribute rather than a function call. This is incorrect as `is_import` is defined as a function in the provided imports.
2. The same issue occurs in the conditional check `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield` where `is_yield` is also being used as an attribute instead of a function call.

The cause of the bug is that the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions are being incorrectly referenced as attributes in the conditional checks within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This leads to a `AttributeError` because `self.previous_line` does not have `is_import` or `is_yield` attributes.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions with the correct arguments. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between imports.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the functions `is_import` and `is_yield` are called with the `self.previous_line` object as an argument to correctly check if the previous line is an import or yield statement. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as intended.
