### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines in a code block based on certain conditions like indentation depth, line type, etc.
2. The function relies on properties and methods of the `current_line` object and references the `previous_line` object to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.
3. There are references to methods like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield`, and properties like `depth`, `leaves`, `prefix` within the function.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of newlines before and after specific types of lines like decorators, imports, flow control statements, etc.

### Error:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the conditions for inserting empty lines before or after specific types of lines. It appears that the check for `is_import` in the condition block is not correct due to referencing `self.previous_line` instead of `current_line`. This mistake causes the function to not identify the previous line as an import, leading to incorrect newline insertion based on import statements.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the `previous_line` is an import based on the `current_line`. We should check if the `current_line` is import and the `previous_line` is not an import. This adjustment should provide the correct behavior for handling newlines before or after import statements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.is_import:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and not self.previous_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking imports has been modified to correctly compare the `current_line` and `previous_line` to determine the correct handling of empty lines before or after import statements.
