## Analysis:
- The `is_import` function is called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. However, the `is_import` function is not defined within the provided code snippet, which could potentially lead to an error.
- The `is_import` function is expected to return a boolean value, but its implementation is missing in the code.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug in this code seems to be caused by the missing implementation of the `is_import` function and its utilization in the `if` condition within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This causes the `self.previous_line.is_import` check to fail, as the `is_import` function is not correctly defined.

## Bug Fix:
1. Define the `is_import` function properly to return a boolean value.
2. Update the condition in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to handle the `is_import` check correctly based on the return value of the `is_import` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# This function is added to provide the required functionality for is_import
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Implementation of is_import function
    return leaf.is_import

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Update to use the is_import function
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Update to use the is_import function
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By implementing the `is_import` function and adjusting the usage in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug should be fixed.
