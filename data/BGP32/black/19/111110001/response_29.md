### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is checking whether the `current_line` is an import or yield using `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` respectively. However, these attributes are not defined within the `Line` class or anywhere in the provided code snippet.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to an assertion error where the expected and actual formatted outputs do not match.
3. The error message shows a difference in the expected and actual formatted outputs due to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after comments in decorator.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the empty lines are correctly inserted based on the conditions specified in `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
5. In the corrected version, we will ensure that the conditions for handling empty lines before and after comments in decorator are correctly implemented.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import') and hasattr(current_line, 'is_import') and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield') and hasattr(current_line, 'is_yield') and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check using `hasattr` to ensure that `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes are available in both `current_line` and `previous_line` before comparing them in the conditions. This change should fix the bug and make the `_maybe_empty_lines` function work correctly.
