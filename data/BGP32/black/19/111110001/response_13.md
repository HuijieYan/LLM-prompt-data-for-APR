### Analysis:
The error message indicates that there is an issue with the formatting of the source code related to comments and empty lines. This error likely stems from the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are conditions in the function that control the insertion of empty lines based on the type of line being processed (e.g., import, decorators, flow control).

### Potential Error Location:
The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` is likely causing the bug. The function uses `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line was an import, but instead, it should call the `is_import` function that correctly identifies import statements.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by directly accessing `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line`, which does not exist. This leads to incorrect logic in determining whether to insert empty lines before or after certain lines, resulting in the formatting discrepancy seen in the error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as an argument. This way, we can correctly determine if the previous line was an import statement.

### Corrected Version of the Bug-Fix Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `is_import(self.previous_line)` is used instead of `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly check if the previous line was an import statement. This change should address the bug and ensure correct formatting of the source code, resolving the issue encountered in the failing test.
