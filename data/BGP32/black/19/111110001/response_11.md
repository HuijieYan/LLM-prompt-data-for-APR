### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function has several conditionals and calculations to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` calls the function `fs`, which internally calls the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
4. The error message indicates an `AssertionError`, suggesting that the expected output does not match the actual output.
5. The comparison shows a difference in the number of empty lines inserted in the output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by the comparison logic related to empty lines that need to be inserted around decorators. The condition that checks if the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition that checks for imports to ensure it correctly handles the scenario when the previous line was an import, but the current line is not an import.
2. Adjust the logic to handle decorator lines and their placement of empty lines.
3. Ensure that the function returns the correct count of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 1, 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted before and after the current line based on the given scenarios. This should address the bug identified in the function.
