### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method defined in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function contains logic to determine the number of empty lines that should be added before and after the current line based on certain conditions.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates a discrepancy in the number of empty lines inserted in the output.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in certain conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Bug in the Function:
The bug lies in the condition where it checks if the `current_line` is an import statement based on the `is_import` method. The bug arises because it compares the `is_import` method with the `self.previous_line.is_import` property of the `current_line`, which is incorrect. The correct comparison should be made using the `is_import` method directly with the `current_line`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, update the comparison in the condition that checks for import statements. Instead of comparing with `self.previous_line.is_import`, use the `is_import` function with the `current_line` directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.is_import(current_line):  # Corrected line to check current_line for import
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the correction highlighted in the `if current_line.is_import(current_line):` line, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now behave correctly when determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on import statements.
