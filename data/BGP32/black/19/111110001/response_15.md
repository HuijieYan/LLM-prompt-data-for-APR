### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class in the `black.py` file.
- The error message in the failing test indicates an assertion error stating that the expected output does not match the actual output.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` seems to be related to commenting within decorators.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be related to how the `_maybe_empty_lines` function handles comments within decorators.
- The function incorrectly checks for `current_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function to determine if the current line is an import. This causes incorrect handling of `is_import` within the function, leading to differences in expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition that checks if a line is an import to use the `is_import` function instead of checking the attribute directly.
- Update the logic to correctly handle comments within decorators.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle comments within decorators correctly and pass the failing test.
