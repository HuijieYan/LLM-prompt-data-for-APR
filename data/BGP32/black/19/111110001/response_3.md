### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the class `EmptyLineTracker` is attempting to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions like depth, presence of leaves, decorators, imports, etc.
2. There is a call to `self.previous_line.is_import` in the function which is causing the error. This is intended to check if the previous line is an import, but `is_import` is actually a separate function defined in the same file.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an `AssertionError` because the expected and actual outputs are not matching due to the buggy behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify if the previous line is an import by using the `is_import` function defined in the file and passing the appropriate `Leaf` object corresponding to the previous line to this function.
5. After identifying and fixing the bug, the corrected version of the function should be able to determine the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use the `is_import` function to correctly identify if the previous line is an import.
2. Pass the `Leaf` object corresponding to the previous line to the `is_import` function to get the correct boolean value.
3. Update the code in `_maybe_empty_lines` to use the result of the `is_import` function call to determine the number of empty lines needed appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# Imported function from the same file, for determining if line is an import
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Implementation of the function

# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with the call to `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly determine if the previous line is an import. This change should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
