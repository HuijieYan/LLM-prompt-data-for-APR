### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a `_maybe_empty_lines` function that has a bug when checking if the previous line is an import statement. It tries to call the `is_import` function as a method of the `current_line` object, which is incorrect because `is_import` is actually a separate function.
2. The bug occurs when trying to access `current_line.is_import`, which is incorrect as `is_import` is a standalone function and should not be accessed like a method.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output has extra newlines inserted in places where they shouldn't be, most likely due to incorrect logic in determining when to add empty lines.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change how the `is_import` function is called and handle the logic for checking if the current and previous lines are import statements correctly.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
            and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if the current line is not an import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By fixing the function to correctly call the `is_import` function externally and adjusting the logic for checking import statements, this corrected version should pass the failing test.
