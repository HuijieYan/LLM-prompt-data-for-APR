### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function checks for different conditions based on the input `current_line` to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` in the test function `test_comment_in_decorator`, showing a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines, potentially related to decorators or comments.
  
### Identified Issue:
The issue is that the function is checking `is_import` directly as an attribute of `current_line`, which is incorrect. The `is_import` function is defined separately, so it should be called as a function, not an attribute.

### Fix Strategy:
Since the function `is_import` is defined as a separate function, it should be called properly to check if the current line is an import. This involves calling the `is_import` function with the appropriate arguments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Import necessary modules here

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function `is_import` is now called correctly as a function, ensuring the comparison is done accurately for identifying import lines in the code.
