### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method belonging to the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the `current_line` object.
3. One of the conditions checks whether `current_line` is an import by calling the `is_import` function.
4. The error message indicates a discrepancy related to empty lines in the output.
5. The failing test involves checking the formatting output of the function.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic when checking if the `current_line` is an import. The issue arises from checking `self.previous_line.is_import`, which leads to a `AttributeError` as there is no `is_import` attribute in the `previous_line` object.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check `self.previous_line.is_import` is corrected to utilize the `is_import` function correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the bug related to checking `self.previous_line.is_import` has been fixed by using the `is_import` function to determine if the `previous_line` is an import. Now, the function should pass the failing test successfully.
