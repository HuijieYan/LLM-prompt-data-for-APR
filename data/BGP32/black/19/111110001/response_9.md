### 1. Analyze
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is using `is_import` function from the same module. The error message indicates an `AttributeError` related to `is_import`, suggesting that the function is not being accessed correctly.

### 2. Identify
The bug is likely due to how the `is_import` function is being called inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is attempting to access `is_import` like an attribute of `current_line` which is incorrect.

### 3. Explain
The bug occurs because the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is trying to access `is_import` as an attribute of `current_line`, which is not the correct way to call an independent function. This leads to an `AttributeError` in the failing test.

### 4. Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `is_import` function as an independent function, without trying to access it as an attribute of another object.

### 5. Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    # Call the is_import function independently
    if is_import(current_line):
        return 0, 0

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    ...
```

By calling the `is_import` function independently within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, rather than trying to access it as an attribute of a line object, the bug should be fixed.
