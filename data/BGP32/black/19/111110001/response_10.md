1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`. It contains logic to determine the number of empty lines to add before and after a line based on certain conditions. One notable issue in the function is referencing `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` as functions, which are actually missing from the context provided.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are where it tries to access attributes or functions (`is_import`, `is_yield`) of the `current_line` object without appropriate definitions.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function tries to call `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` as functions, leading to a `AttributeError`. This is evident from the failing test, where the comparison fails due to missing methods.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_line` object has the necessary attributes or methods like `is_import`, `is_yield`, etc., accessible within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')  # Check if `is_import` attribute exists
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')  # Check if `is_yield` attribute exists
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we added checks `hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')` and `hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')` to ensure that the attributes are present before accessing them as functions. This modification should resolve the `AttributeError` and make the test pass successfully.
