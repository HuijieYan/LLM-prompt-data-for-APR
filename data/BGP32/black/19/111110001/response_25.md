### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has an issue when checking if the current line is an import. It tries to call `current_line.is_import` directly, assuming it's a boolean value, but it should actually call the `is_import` function from the same file to perform this check.
2. The failing test is related to formatting a source code snippet with comments inside decorators. The error message indicates a mismatch between expected and actual formatted source code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from directly accessing `current_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`. This leads to an attribute error during execution because `is_import` is expected to be a function but is treated as a boolean attribute, causing the test to fail as the output formatting changes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` object to determine if the line is an import statement within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This will ensure that the correct check is performed. Additionally, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should return the computed values for empty lines correctly to pass the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected line for checking import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Corrected line for checking import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `is_import` function is correctly used to check if the current and previous lines are import statements, ensuring the correct behavior of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`.
