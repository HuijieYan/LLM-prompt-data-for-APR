### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a `_maybe_empty_lines` method that is using `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line was an import. However, the `is_import` function is defined outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is not directly accessible as `self.is_import`.
2. Due to this, the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` is causing an issue as `is_import` is not directly associated with `self.previous_line`.
3. This issue is leading to a failed test where there is a comparison involving imports in the source code formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` method in `EmptyLineTracker` to explicitly call the `is_import` function with the `Line` object associated with the current line to check if the line is an import.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By modifying the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)` we ensure that the `is_import` function is correctly called to check if a line is an import. This fix should address the issue and make the function behave correctly in the context of checking imports for empty lines.
