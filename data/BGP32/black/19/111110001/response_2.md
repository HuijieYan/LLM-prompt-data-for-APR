### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. Within this function, there is a comparison using `current_line.is_import` to identify if the current line is an import statement. However, `is_import` is a separate function defined in the file `black.py`, not a property of the `Line` class that `current_line` object belongs to.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is encountering an error because the buggy function tries to access `self.previous_line.is_import`, expecting it to be a boolean, which results in incorrect behavior and assertion failure.
   
### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Both these lines assume that `is_import` is a property of `Line` object, but in reality, it should be determined using the `is_import` function defined separately.

### Suggested Fix:
Since the `is_import` function is available to determine if a line is an import statement, the fix involves using this function correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method to check for imports.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now correctly uses the `is_import` function to determine if a line is an import statement, fixing the bug that caused the failing test. This correction ensures that the method functions as intended without producing erroneous results related to imports.
