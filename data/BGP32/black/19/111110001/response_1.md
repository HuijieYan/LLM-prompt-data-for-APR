### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines()` that determines the number of empty lines before and after a given line based on certain conditions.
2. The buggy part of the code seems to be the condition where it checks if the previous line is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`. This condition is likely failing because `self.previous_line.is_import` is trying to access a method `is_import` on the `previous_line` without calling it as a function.
3. The failing test is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly call the `is_import` function to check if the `previous_line` is an import.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We should ensure that the `is_import` function is properly called to check if the `previous_line` is an import.
2. If the `previous_line.is_import` check is still valid, we need to make sure that `self.previous_line` is correctly updated when setting the previous line in the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function.

```

By calling `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`, we ensure that the `is_import` function is correctly used to check if the `previous_line` is an import. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
