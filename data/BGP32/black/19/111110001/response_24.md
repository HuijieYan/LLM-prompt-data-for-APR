### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function checks for various conditions to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error in the function seems to be related to the condition where it checks if the previous line is an import.
4. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is testing the formatting of comments within decorators and is failing due to a mismatch in expected and actual output.
5. The error message indicates a specific diff between the expected and actual formatted code, mentioning comments within decorators as part of the mismatch.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises when checking if the previous line is an import. The function incorrectly uses `self.previous_line.is_import`, where `is_import` is a function and should be called as `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where it checks for the previous line being an import, and correctly call the `is_import` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected the condition to check if previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
