### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. The function is attempting to determine the number of empty lines that should be added before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is related to formatting issues, specifically related to comments within decorators.
4. The error message indicates an assertion error due to a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code containing comments.

### Identified Issue:
The buggy function checks for `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `current_line.is_decorator`, but it does not call the related functions `is_import`, `is_yield`, or `is_decorator` to determine those properties. Instead, it attempts direct attribute access, causing the error because these attributes are not directly available on the `Line` object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the buggy function needs to call the related functions (`is_import`, `is_yield`, `is_decorator`) to correctly determine the properties of the `current_line`. This will ensure that the conditions in the function are properly evaluated based on the actual characteristics of the line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = is_decorator(current_line)
    is_import_line = is_import(current_line)
    is_yield_line = is_yield(current_line)
    
    if is_decorator or is_def(current_line) or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_decorator(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import_line(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import_line
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield_line(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield_line or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, the related functions (`is_import`, `is_yield`, `is_decorator`) are called to determine the properties of the `current_line`. This change ensures that the function behaves as intended and the conditions are evaluated correctly based on the line properties.
