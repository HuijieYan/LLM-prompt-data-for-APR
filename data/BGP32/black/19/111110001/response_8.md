### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a `_maybe_empty_lines` function that is attempting to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The error in the function seems to be related to the logic of adding empty lines based on certain conditions such as decorators, definitions, imports, etc.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the `fs` function, which ultimately results in an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual formatted code strings.
4. The error in the function appears to be related to the conditional logic for adding empty lines before or after a line, specifically in the conditions related to imports and decorators.
5. The error message in the failing test indicates that there are discrepancies in the number of empty lines added before or after certain lines, leading to a formatting mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug appears to be in the logic that handles the insertion of empty lines before or after lines based on certain criteria like imports, decorators, flow control, etc. Specifically, the condition `current_line.is_import` is trying to access the `is_import` attribute directly from the `current_line` instance which is incorrect, as `is_import` is a separate function called `is_import` and not an attribute of the `Line` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition `current_line.is_import` should be replaced with a call to the `is_import` function passing the `current_line` as an argument to determine if the current line is an import line or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixed version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function here instead
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Call is_import function here instead
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above change and calling the `is_import` function to determine if the line is an import line, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
