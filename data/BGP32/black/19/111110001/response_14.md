### Analysis:
- The `is_import` function is used in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing the expected and actual formatted source code.
- The error message indicates a specific difference related to comments within decorators in the source code.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of comments within decorators.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of comments within decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
- The comparison between the expected and actual formatted source code fails, specifically related to comments within decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle comments within decorators.
2. Ensure that the expected and actual formatted source code align properly, especially regarding comments within decorators.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have updated the condition for checking imports within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly identify imports using the `is_import` function. This should fix the bug related to comments within decorators in the source code formatting.
