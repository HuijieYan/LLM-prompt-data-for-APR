### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic related to the handling of empty lines. The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines (before and after) to insert based on certain conditions. However, the issue arises from how the `before` variable is updated and used within the function.

In multiple scenarios, the `before` variable is set to `1` even when it should remain `0`. This happens when updating the `before` variable inside the while loop when popping elements from `self.previous_defs`. The logic of setting `before = 1 if depth else 2` is incorrect. It should not always set `before` to `1` when depth is non-zero.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the logic to update the `before` variable correctly based on the conditions inside the while loop.
2. Ensure that the `before` variable retains its value in cases where it should not be updated.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic related to updating the `before` variable, the function should now behave as intended and pass the failing tests.
