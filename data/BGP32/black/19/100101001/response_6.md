### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the handling of the `max_allowed` value when `current_line.depth == 0`. The issue arises from setting `max_allowed` to 2 when `current_line.depth == 0` and then resetting it to 1 if certain conditions are met. This inconsistency leads to incorrect behavior when determining the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `max_allowed` value is set correctly based on the conditions within the function. We should set `max_allowed` to 2 initially, then adjust it to 1 only when necessary. Additionally, we need to make sure that the logic for handling empty lines and newlines is properly executed based on the different conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
            return before, 0
        else:
            before = 0
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections to the function, it should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the different conditions and ensure that the `max_allowed` value is set consistently. These changes should address the bug and make the function behave as intended.
