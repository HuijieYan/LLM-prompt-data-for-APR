### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in specific scenarios. The function is designed to determine the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line based on various conditions. However, the current implementation fails to produce the correct output in certain cases, leading to failing tests.

1. The function incorrectly sets `max_allowed` to 2 when `current_line.depth` is 0, but in certain cases, it should be set to 1.
2. The logic involving `self.previous_defs` to determine the number of empty lines is not functioning correctly.
3. The conditions for checking decorators, imports, and flow control statements might be flawed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issues identified above, we need to:
1. Adjust the logic for setting `max_allowed` based on line depth.
2. Fix the logic involving `self.previous_defs` to handle the insertion of empty lines correctly.
3. Review and revise the conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control statements for accuracy.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1
    else:
        max_allowed = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to handle the different edge cases properly and is expected to pass the failing test scenarios provided.
