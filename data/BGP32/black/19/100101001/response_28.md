### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect manipulation of the `before` variable which determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue arises when handling cases where `before` should be set to a specific value but is not being updated correctly.

In Case 1, the function sets `before = 1` which is correct, but in subsequent cases where `before` is expected to be set to 1 or 2 based on certain conditions, it fails to update `before` correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated properly based on the conditions specified in the function. Specifically, when should set `before = 1` if `depth` is not zero and `self.previous_defs` is not empty. Additionally, we should update the return statements to correctly return the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the updated logic to correctly update the `before` variable and return the appropriate values based on conditions, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
