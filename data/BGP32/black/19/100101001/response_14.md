### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the incorrect calculation of the number of newlines to be returned based on the conditions provided. The logic for determining the number of newlines is convoluted and does not handle all cases correctly. This leads to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the conditions and logic for determining the number of newlines to be returned for different cases.
2. Ensure that each conditional branch accurately calculates the number of newlines required based on the input parameters.
3. Simplify the logic where possible to make the function more readable and easier to maintain.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 1), 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 1), 0
    
    return min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), 2), 0
```

By restructuring the logic in the corrected function above, the cases for determining the number of newlines to be returned are handled more accurately and effectively, which should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing tests.
