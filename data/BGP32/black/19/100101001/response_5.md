### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue arises when handling cases where it should not insert empty lines based on the conditions provided.

In cases where `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert. It should not insert empty lines before decorators, but the logic in the function is not correctly handling this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`. We need to ensure that no empty lines are inserted before decorators.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes the necessary logic to handle cases where the current line is a decorator, ensuring that no empty lines are inserted before decorators.
