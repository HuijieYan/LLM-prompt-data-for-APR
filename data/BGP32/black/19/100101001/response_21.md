From the provided information, it seems that the issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition where newlines are being calculated. In particular, the calculation of `newlines` is incorrect, leading to the failing test cases.

The problematic section is where `newlines` is determined:
```python
newlines = 2
if current_line.depth:
    newlines -= 1
return newlines, 0
```

In the failing test cases, `current_line.depth` is equal to `0`, but the code incorrectly subtracts 1 from `newlines`, resulting in an incorrect value for cases involving decorators.

To fix this bug, the subtraction of 1 from `newlines` when `current_line.depth != 0` needs to be adjusted. Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the calculation of `newlines` based on the `current_line.depth`, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
