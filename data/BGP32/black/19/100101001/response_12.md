The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how the empty lines are handled in certain cases, especially when dealing with decorators and newlines. The function fails to return the correct number of empty lines based on the given conditions, which causes the failing tests.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. In particular, the function should consider the specific cases of decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields when calculating the required empty lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Handle decorators, classes, defs, and newlines
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    # Handle flow control statements
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
        
    # Handle imports and yields
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the cases of decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the given conditions.
