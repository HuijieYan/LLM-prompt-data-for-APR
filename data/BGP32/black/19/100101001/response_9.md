### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line while formatting code. However, the logic for handling empty lines and counting them based on different conditions seems to have a bug.

#### Issues:
1. The `before` variable is overwritten in the loop if `self.previous_defs` is not empty. Instead of adding 1 or 2 at each iteration, it should accumulate the value based on conditions.
2. The condition for calculating `newlines` seems incorrect as it always returns `2` and subtracts `1` only if `current_line.depth` is not `0`.
3. Conditions for handling import, yield statements, and inserting empty lines between decorators are incorrect.
4. Handling initial conditions for the previous line, decorators, and first line needs improvement.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain a separate counter for empty lines (`lines_before`) in the loop when `self.previous_defs` is not empty.
2. Correct the conditions for calculating empty lines before the current line based on different scenarios.
3. Update conditions for handling import statements, yield statements, decorators, and the initial lines.
4. Keep track of the first line and decorators to avoid inserting empty lines in inappropriate places.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    lines_before = 0
    for depth in reversed(self.previous_defs):
        if depth >= current_line.depth:
            lines_before += 2 if depth == current_line.depth else 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return lines_before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(lines_before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(lines_before, 1), 0

    return max(current_line.depth and max_allowed or 0, lines_before), 0
``` 

By updating the logic based on the identified bug issues and fixing the conditions for handling different scenarios, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
