### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions. However, there are issues with how the function handles different cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

The main issue lies in the calculation of the `newlines` variable. In Case 3 (the final test case provided), the function checks if the current line is a decorator and sets `is_decorator` to `True`. It then checks if the `previous_line` is `None`, which is not the case. However, in the next condition where it checks for the previous line and its decorator status, it returns `0, 0` instead of the expected number of newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the calculation of `newlines` to handle the case where the current line is considered a decorator and the previous line is not `None`.
2. Fix the logic related to determining empty line insertion based on the decorator status of the current and previous lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines += 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By updating the `newlines` calculation and the conditions related to decorators, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test cases.
