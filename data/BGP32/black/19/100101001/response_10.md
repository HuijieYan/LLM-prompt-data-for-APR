### Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic used to determine the number of newlines to insert before the current line. 

1. In Case 1, the function does not handle the scenario properly where the current line is a decorator (`current_line.is_decorator=True`). It should return 0 newlines before the current line in this case, but it incorrectly calculates `newlines` as `2` regardless of the depth.
2. In Case 2, the function again fails to handle the case where the current line is a decorator (`current_line.is_decorator=False`) but the previous line is also an @decorator. It should return 0 newlines in such a scenario to maintain correct formatting, but it fails to do so.
3. In Cases 3, 4, 5, and 6, there are similar issues with handling decorators and determining the correct number of newlines to return based on the conditions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the cases where the current line is a decorator or involves decorators. Specifically, the logic to determine the number of newlines to insert needs to be adjusted to account for decorators and their impact on formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should handle the scenarios involving decorators properly and pass the failing tests.
