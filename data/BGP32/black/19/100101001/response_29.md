### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the logic of inserting empty lines in the context of code formatting. It checks various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` provided as input. However, there are multiple issues in the function that are causing the failing tests.

### Issues Identified
1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the condition for inserting empty lines before the first line in the file and between decorators is incorrect. The function always returns `(0, 0)` in these cases, which is not the desired behavior based on the input.
   
2. In Case 4, when checking the condition related to imports, the logic is flawed. The function incorrectly checks if the current line is not an import and matches the depth with the previous line. This condition should be adjusted.
   
3. In Case 8, the function incorrectly sets `max_allowed` to 1 when `current_line.depth == 0`. However, it should set `max_allowed` to 2 in this case as per the requirements.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the identified issues, the following changes can be made to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Adjust the conditions related to inserting empty lines before the first line in the file and between decorators to correctly reflect the expected behavior.
   
2. Correct the logic for checking the condition related to imports to ensure the correct handling of empty lines.
   
3. Update the calculation of `max_allowed` to set it as 2 when `current_line.depth == 0`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.is_yield and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the specified conditions, and the failing tests should pass.
