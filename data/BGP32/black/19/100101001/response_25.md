### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted before a line in the source code. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle different scenarios to determine the appropriate number of empty lines. However, due to incorrect logic or handling of certain conditions, the function is not producing the expected output in the failing test cases.

1. In Case 1, the function should return `(2, 0)` but it is returning `(0, 0)`.
2. In Case 2, the function should return `(0, 0)` but it is returning `(2, 0)`.
3. In Case 3, the function should return `(1, 0)` but it is returning `(2, 0)`.
4. In Case 4, the function should return `(1, 0)` but it is returning `(2, 0)`.
5. In Case 5, the function should return `(1, 0)` but it is returning `(2, 0)`.
6. In Case 6, the function should return `(2, 0)` but it is returning `(0, 0)`.
7. In Case 7, the function should return `(0, 0)` but it is returning `(1, 0)`.
8. In Case 8, the function should return `(1, 0)` but it is returning `(0, 0)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of edge cases and conditions that affect the calculation of empty lines. To fix the bug, the function needs to be revised to properly account for these cases:
1. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the conditions specified.
2. Handle scenarios where the previous line is a decorator, import, or yield statement correctly.
3. Update the logic to track and update previous definitions properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring the correct handling of cases and conditions in the function, the corrected version should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
