### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the logic for inserting empty lines properly in the formatting process. However, there are several issues in the function that are causing it to fail the test cases. 

1. The variable `before` is being reassigned within the while loop, which could lead to unexpected behavior in determining the number of empty lines to insert.
2. The condition in the `if` statement for checking if the current line is a decorator is incorrect, leading to incorrect logic for handling decorators.
3. The conditions for checking flow control, imports, and yield statements are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect return values in those cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the issues mentioned above. Specifically:
1. Fix the reassignment of the `before` variable within the while loop to ensure it retains the correct count of empty lines to insert.
2. Update the condition for checking if the current line is a decorator to properly handle the cases where decorators are involved.
3. Adjust the conditions for flow control, imports, and yield statements to return the correct number of empty lines based on the context.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes the necessary fixes to handle the edge cases properly and should now pass the failing test cases.
