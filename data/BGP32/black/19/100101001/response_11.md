### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly calculating the number of newlines to insert before a given line. The logic is supposed to handle different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., and adjust the number of newlines accordingly. However, there are issues in the logic that lead to incorrect newline insertion.

1. In Case 2, the function is incorrectly returning 0 newlines when the current line is not a decorator, but the previous line is a decorator. This is contradictory as the intention is to avoid inserting empty lines between decorators, which should result in a return of 0 newlines.

2. In Case 3, the function does not correctly handle the condition when the current line is neither a decorator nor an import. The previous line is a decorator, but the depth is the same. In this case, it should return the `before` value for the number of newlines to insert, but it returns 0 instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, consider the following adjustments:

1. Ensure that the logic for handling different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., is correctly implemented to determine the number of newlines to insert before a line.
   
2. Pay close attention to conditions where specific rules apply, such as avoiding inserting empty lines between decorators, adjusting newline counts based on line depth, and handling special cases like the first line in the file appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_import and self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By making the above corrections and ensuring the function correctly handles all the scenarios based on the conditions provided, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be fixed.
