The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before specific types of code blocks like decorators, definitions, classes, imports, and yield statements. The logic inside the function may not be correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions provided.

Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect calculation of `newlines` for decorators, classes, and definitions.
2. Inconsistencies in handling `before` variable for flow control, imports, and yield statements.

Cause of the bug:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly assigns `newlines = 2` for decorators.
2. In Case 2 and Case 5, the function incorrectly sets `before` value to `0` for flow control and imports, causing unexpected behavior.
3. In Case 6, the logic around determining `newlines` for decorators may not consider all necessary conditions.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review the conditions for calculating `newlines`, `before`, and other variables for decorators, classes, definitions, imports, flow control, and yields.
2. Ensure that the logic correctly handles each case and inserts the appropriate number of empty lines based on the code block type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version aims to address the issues identified in the original function by adjusting the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on different code block types. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
