### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function due to incorrect handling of empty lines before certain types of lines. The function is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions, but it fails to do so correctly in some cases, leading to incorrect spacing in the output.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be located in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before specific types of lines such as decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `before` variable that determines the number of empty lines to insert before a line. The value of `before` is being set to `1` for certain cases when it should be either `0` or `max_allowed` based on the condition.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions specified in the function. Correctly setting the `before` variable to either `0` or `max_allowed` in specific scenarios will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 0 if depth == 0 else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to the logic inside the function, the corrected version should now accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert before specific types of lines, resolving the bug.
