The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable when setting it based on the conditions inside the `while` loop. The `before` variable should be updated based on the conditions within the loop, but the current implementation overwrites its value in each iteration of the loop, leading to incorrect output values.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic within the `while` loop to correctly handle the updating of the `before` variable without overwriting it. We should set the initial value of `before` using the conditions outside the loop, and then update it within the loop based on additional conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Set initial value of 'before'
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update 'before' based on while loop conditions
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By properly adjusting the `before` variable inside the `while` loop and keeping track of conditions at each step, the corrected function should now provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test cases.
