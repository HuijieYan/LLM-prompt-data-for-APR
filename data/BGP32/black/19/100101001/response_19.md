### Bug Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is intended to handle different cases to determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the characteristics of the current line. However, there are several issues in the function that are causing it to fail the provided test cases. Here are the key observations:
1. In Case 7, the function is incorrectly handling the condition related to decorators. It is adding the current depth to `before` but should be checking if the current depth is 0 or not.
2. In Case 8, the function is not correctly handling the case where the `current_line.depth` is non-zero. It is not subtracting 1 from `newlines` when `current_line.depth` is non-zero.
3. In general, the way the function is updating the `before` variable in different cases is causing incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the issues and make the function work correctly, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to add in different scenarios. Specifically:
1. Check if the current depth is 0 when handling decorators in order to update `before` correctly.
2. When dealing with non-zero current depth, make sure to update `newlines` accordingly by subtracting 1.
3. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly for each case without overwriting it inappropriately.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the different cases correctly and pass the provided test cases.
