### Bug Location
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how the variable `before` is handled and updated within the function. In particular, the logic for updating `before` based on conditions like `depth` and `is_decorator` might not be correctly updating the variable in all scenarios.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 1, where `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, the value of `before` is correctly set to `0` initially. However, in the subsequent logic, the value of `newlines` is set to `2`, which implies that there should be two newlines in this case. This contradicts the initial value of `before` being `0`.
- Similarly, in Case 2, where `current_line.is_decorator` is `False`, the initial value of `before` is `0`. But in the final return statement, the function still returns `2` newlines, which is incorrect.
- This inconsistency in updating and utilizing the `before` variable leads to incorrect output values in different scenarios, causing the failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic governing the calculation and usage of the `before` variable is consistent and accurate across all relevant cases in the function. Specifically, we need to carefully update `before` based on the various conditions and return the correct number of newlines as specified by the logic of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the handling of the `before` variable and ensuring that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the defined logic, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests.
