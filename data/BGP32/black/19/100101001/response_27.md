### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic used to calculate the number of newlines to insert before the current line. The function is designed to handle different cases based on the properties of the current line, such as whether it's a decorator, a definition, a class, flow control, import, or yield statement.

However, the bug occurs in scenarios where certain conditions are met, causing incorrect newline calculations and leading to failing tests.

1. In Case 1, the current line is a decorator, but the logic to handle decorators doesn't account for the situation when `self.previous_line` is `None`, resulting in incorrect newline counts.

2. In Case 2, although the current line is not a decorator, the logic fails to correctly handle the scenario when `self.previous_line` is a decorator. This again leads to incorrect newline insertion.

3. In Case 3, similar to Case 1, the logic to handle decorators incorrectly returns newlines based on the depth of the current line, which is flawed.

4. Case 4 showcases yet another case where improper handling of decorators affects the newline count.

5. In Case 5, the incorrect insertion of newlines is due to the presence of an import statement, which is not handled accurately.

6. Case 6 highlights how the function mishandles decorators with a previous line containing `Yield`, leading to incorrect newline counts.

7. In Case 7, the presence of a function definition and the subsequent `pass` statement causes a discrepancy in newline insertion, showcasing improper handling of function definitions.

8. In Case 8, the issue with the function's handling of the `pass` statement further demonstrates the inaccuracies in newline calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be revised to correctly handle the different conditions and scenarios. Specifically, adjustments should be made to handle decorators, definition statements, import statements, and the presence of `pass` statements accurately.

By addressing the identified issues in the logic, the function should be able to calculate the correct number of newlines to insert before the current line based on the various conditions specified.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With these modifications, the function should now be able to correctly handle the different scenarios and produce the expected newline counts, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
