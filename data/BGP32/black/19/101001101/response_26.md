The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect handling of empty lines in certain conditions, resulting in unexpected output. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic related to the insertion of empty lines based on the given input parameters and conditions.

The bug occurs primarily in the conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control statements. In cases where the current line is a decorator, import, or flow control statement, the function should return the appropriate number of empty lines based on the context.

To correct the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to accurately handle these cases and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1 if current_line.depth else 2, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1 if current_line.depth else 2, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function now properly handles the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous line. It ensures that the correct number of empty lines are returned according to the specified conditions and input parameters.
