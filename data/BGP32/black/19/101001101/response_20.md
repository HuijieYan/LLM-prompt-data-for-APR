## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line based on certain conditions. The issue arises from handling the logic for inserting empty lines between previous and current lines. The function fails to correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the properties of the current and previous lines and other contextual information.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines to insert before a line. We must ensure that the function accurately considers the current line properties (such as being a decorator, a definition, a class, flow control, import, or yielding line) and the relationship with the previous line to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return 0, 0

    if (
        current_line.is_decorator
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return (before or 1), 0

    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected function:
1. Correct handling of inserting empty lines before different types of lines like decorators, definitions, classes, flow controls, imports, or yields.
2. Properly updated the `self.previous_line` variable after determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the relationship with the current line.
3. Fixed the condition to check if the previous line is an import statement by using the `is_import` function.
4. Ensured that the logic for handling different line types and their relationships with the previous line is accurately reflected in determining the number of empty lines to insert.
