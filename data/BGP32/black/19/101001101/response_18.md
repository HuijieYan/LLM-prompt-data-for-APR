The bug in the current function lies in the condition that checks if the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` is `True`. Although the function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` is defined, it is not directly accessible from the `current_line` object. Hence, the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` will not work as intended.

To fix this issue, we need to update the condition checking `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function instead. Since the `is_import` function takes a `Leaf` object as input, we need to pass the relevant `Leaf` object from the `self.previous_line.leaves` list to this function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0])  # Check if the first leaf is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This correction ensures that the correct logic is applied to check if the previous line is an import statement. By calling the `is_import` function with the relevant `Leaf` object, we can accurately determine if the previous line is an import.
