## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function when determining the number of newlines to return. The issue arises from the condition comparing `current_line.is_import` to `self.previous_line.is_import`. The function `is_import` is a separate function, not a property of the `Line` class, so accessing it directly as `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` is causing the bug.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function with the corresponding leaf as an argument to determine if the line is an import statement. Then, we can compare the results to decide whether to return newlines or not.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Correction starts here
    current_line_is_import = is_import(current_line)
    previous_line_is_import = self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line)

    if previous_line_is_import and not current_line_is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By calling the `is_import` function with the appropriate leaf argument, we correctly check if the current line and the previous line are import statements. This revised logic will fix the bug and ensure the function operates as expected.
