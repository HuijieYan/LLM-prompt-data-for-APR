## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when trying to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. The issue arises in cases where the function incorrectly sets the `before` variable without considering the max_allowed value. This leads to incorrect calculation of empty lines to insert.

In the buggy function, the issue primarily arises when updating the `before` variable after consuming the first leaf's newlines. The bug causes the function to set `before` without taking into account the `max_allowed` value. This leads to incorrect results, as the function might set the `before` value higher than the maximum allowed newlines.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly calculated while considering the `max_allowed` value. We should adjust the logic to set `before` only after comparing it with `max_allowed` to stay within the limits defined by `max_allowed`.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the calculation of the `before` variable and ensuring that it respects the `max_allowed` value, the corrected function should now provide the expected output in all cases.
