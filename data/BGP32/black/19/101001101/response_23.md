Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the runtime values provided, it seems that the bug lies in the conditions related to handling empty lines. The issue arises when determining the number of empty lines to insert based on certain conditions such as decorators, imports, and yields.

The bug fix strategy involves adjusting the logic related to handling empty lines, particularly in scenarios where previous lines are decorators, imports, or yields. The correction should ensure the correct calculation of the number of empty lines to insert based on the provided conditions and the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

    if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function, the condition related to the previous line being an import is fixed by calling the `is_import()` function correctly to determine if the previous line is an import. The logic for handling empty lines based on decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields is adjusted to correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert.

By making these adjustments, the function should now handle cases involving decorators, imports, and yields correctly, ensuring that the expected behavior is met for all given scenarios.
