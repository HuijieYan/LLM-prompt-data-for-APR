## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the case where `current_line` is not a decorator, def, or class but is preceded by an import statement (`previous_line.is_import`). The function incorrectly sets the number of empty lines based on the condition `and not current_line.is_import`, which should be the opposite condition since we want to insert empty lines when the previous line is an import but the current line is not. This incorrect condition leads to empty lines not being inserted in some cases where they should.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition that checks for the presence of an import statement in the previous line and the absence of an import statement in the current line. By making this adjustment, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the specific conditions related to import statements.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
