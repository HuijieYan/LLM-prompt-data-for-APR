## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the conditions that check for the type of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. In particular, there is an issue with the condition that checks if the previous line is an import statement (`self.previous_line.is_import`). This check is made directly on the `self.previous_line` object, assuming it has an `is_import` attribute or method, which is not the case.

The error occurs because the function tries to access `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line`, but it should be checked by invoking the `is_import` function from the `is_import` module passing the `self.previous_line` as an argument.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where `self.previous_line.is_import` is checked. Instead of directly accessing the attribute `is_import`, we should call the `is_import` function from the appropriate module passing the `self.previous_line` as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This modification ensures that the `is_import` function is called correctly to determine if the previous line is an import statement, fixing the bug in the function.
