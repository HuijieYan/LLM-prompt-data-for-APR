## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from a conditional check that is not functioning as intended. There are two main areas that need attention:
1. The condition `if not is_decorator` checks if the current line is not a decorator, but it should be checking if the current line is a decorator instead.
2. The condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `is_decorator` is False.

These issues lead to incorrect evaluation of conditions and incorrect return values in certain scenarios, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Correct the condition `if not is_decorator` to `if is_decorator`.
2. Modify the condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class` by handling the case where `is_decorator` is False separately.

With these adjustments, the function should be able to correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the input line conditions.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By correcting the conditional checks and adjusting the logic in the function, the corrected version addresses the bug and provides the correct behavior as needed.
