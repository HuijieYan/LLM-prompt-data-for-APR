## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug occurs in the conditional check related to inserting empty lines before a line within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. There are specific cases where the function returns unexpected values due to incorrect handling of previous line attributes.

### Issues:
1. The function does not correctly handle the case where the previous line is a decorator. It should not insert empty lines between decorators, but the function is not checking this condition properly.
2. In the condition where the current line is an import and the previous line is not, the function incorrectly includes the previous line depth check in determining the number of required empty lines.
3. When checking for previous yield lines, the condition is not correctly comparing the line depth.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Update the check for decorators to avoid inserting empty lines between decorators.
2. Fix the condition for imports to accurately consider the line depth.
3. Adjust the condition for previous yield lines to compare depth correctly.

### Updated Corrected Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
