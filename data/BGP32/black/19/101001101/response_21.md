## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when checking if `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`. The buggy function directly accesses `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming that it is a boolean indicating whether the previous line is an import. However, the function `is_import` is the one that checks if a line is an import but it is not appropriately used to check the previous line in `_maybe_empty_lines`. This leads to an AttributeError because `self.previous_line` does not have an attribute `is_import`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to properly use the `is_import` function to check if a line is an import. We should call this function for both the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` whenever we need to check if they are imports.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using the `is_import` function to check if lines are imports, we eliminate the AttributeError that was occurring in the original buggy code. Now, the correct code should run without errors and correctly determine whether to insert empty lines based on the provided conditions.
