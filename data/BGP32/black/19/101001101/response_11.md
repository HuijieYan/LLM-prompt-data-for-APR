The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the incorrect handling of empty lines in the code formatting. In the provided function, there seems to be an issue with the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert in specific cases. 

The buggy function seems to incorrectly calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on the previous line's properties without properly considering all conditions. One of the potential issues is that the function does not correctly identify the `is_import` property of the `current_line` object, which leads to incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies all relevant conditions and updates the `before` and `newlines` variables accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles the calculation of empty lines based on the conditions related to different line types, imports, yields, and decorators.

By following the correct logical flow and considering all the conditions properly, the function should now produce the expected output for each input scenario provided. Feel free to test the function with the given test cases to verify its correctness.
