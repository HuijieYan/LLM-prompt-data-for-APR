## Bug Explanation
Based on the provided runtime and expected values, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function becomes apparent when handling the case where `current_line` is a decorator. In this scenario, the code should not insert empty lines before the first line in the file and should not insert empty lines between decorators. However, the current implementation does not cover these conditions correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling the cases involving decorators. Specifically, we need to ensure that no empty lines are inserted before the first line in the file and between decorators. Additionally, we should update the logic to match the expected behavior defined in the test cases.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditions for handling decorators and ensuring that no empty lines are inserted before the first line in the file or between decorators, the corrected function should now behave as expected in the provided test cases.
