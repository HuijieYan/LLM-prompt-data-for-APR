The bug in the provided function lies in the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining whether to insert empty lines in the code based on various conditions. However, in some cases, the function incorrectly inserts empty lines due to incorrect logic.

The bug causes incorrect insertion of empty lines in specific scenarios where the function should not be adding them.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the conditions for when to insert empty lines and when not to insert them should be refined.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 0, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The conditions for inserting empty lines have been adjusted to match the expected behavior in different scenarios.
- The function now correctly handles cases where empty lines should not be inserted.
- The function returns the correct number of newlines to be inserted based on updated conditions.

This corrected version should now successfully handle the scenarios where the previous function was adding unnecessary empty lines.
