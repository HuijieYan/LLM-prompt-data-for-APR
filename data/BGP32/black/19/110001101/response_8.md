## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of `before` variable when the depth is not 0. In cases where the depth is non-zero, the function incorrectly sets `before` to 1 instead of preserving its original value. This leads to incorrect calculation of empty lines in these scenarios.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable maintains its original value when the depth is not 0. This can be achieved by updating the calculation of `before` at the beginning of the function to only assign `before` to 1 when the depth is 0. For non-zero depths, we should preserve the existing value of `before`.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `before` variable retains its original value when the depth is not 0, addressing the bug identified in the original version.
