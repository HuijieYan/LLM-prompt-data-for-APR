## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the calculation of the `before` variable. In the while loop, the `before` variable is set to either 1 or 2 based on the depth condition, but it should be accumulated instead of being reassigned each time. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code so that the `before` variable correctly accumulates the number of empty lines. Instead of reassigning it inside the loop, we should increment it by 1 or 2 based on the depth condition.

## Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before += (1 if depth else 2)  # Accumulate the additional empty lines
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Now, the `before` variable correctly accumulates the number of empty lines in each iteration of the while loop, resolving the bug in the function.
