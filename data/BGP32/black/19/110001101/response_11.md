## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are multiple issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The logic for updating the `before` variable within the `while` loop is incorrect, causing it to always be set to 1 or 2 based on `depth` instead of maintaining the original value calculated from the prefix of the first leaf.
2. The conditions for handling decorators, defs, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields are not correctly returning the expected number of empty lines before and after the line.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Maintain a separate variable to store the original number of empty lines (`before`) calculated from the prefix of the first leaf before modifying it.
2. Update the logic within the `while` loop to properly update the `before` variable based on the original value.
3. Modify the conditions for handling decorators, defs, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields to correctly calculate and return the number of empty lines.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By following the bug fix strategy and updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the function should now correctly calculate and return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
