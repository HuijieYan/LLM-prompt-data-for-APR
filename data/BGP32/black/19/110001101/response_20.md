### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line. In cases where certain conditions are met, the function is incorrectly returning `(0, 0)` instead of the correct values.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs mainly in the conditionals that check for various properties of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the conditions for each scenario are properly checked and return the correct number of empty lines accordingly.
2. Make sure the logic relating to decorators, imports, yields, flow control, and classes/functions is correctly handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With the corrected version of the function, the conditions are correctly handled, ensuring that the appropriate number of empty lines are returned based on the properties of the current line and the previous line.
