### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logical flow within the function that results in incorrect values being returned in certain cases. Specifically, the issue lies in the handling of the `newlines` variable when the conditions for decorators, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` are met. These conditions are not set up correctly, which leads to wrong calculations and invalid return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic within the function, especially focusing on the conditions related to decorators, definitions (`def`), and classes. By adjusting the conditions and the calculation of the `newlines` variable, we can ensure that the correct values are returned based on the given input.

### Corrected Function
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line):
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function adjusts the logic to ensure proper handling of different cases and correctly calculates the values to return based on the input. This revised version should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
