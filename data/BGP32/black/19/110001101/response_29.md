## Strategy for fixing the bug

After analyzing the buggy function and the provided runtime and expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the logic for handling the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line. The function seems to have a mix of conditions that may not correctly handle all the cases leading to unexpected outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of empty lines to add before and after the current line based on various conditions such as line types, depth, and specific flags like is_decorator, is_flow_control, is_import, etc. We will need to carefully evaluate each condition and adjust the logic accordingly.

## Corrected version of the function

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, unnecessary conditions have been removed, and the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been simplified to better handle all cases as indicated by the expected input/output values provided. This should address the bug and ensure the function operates correctly for all scenarios.
