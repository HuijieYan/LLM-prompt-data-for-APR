## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines()` is intended to calculate the number of necessary empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. However, the function has a logical error in determining the number of newlines required in certain scenarios.

The main issues identified in the function are:
1. Inconsistent handling of newlines before and after the first leaf of the current line with respect to the `max_allowed` value.
2. Incorrect handling of cases involving decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, leading to incorrect newline calculations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that:
1. The correct number of extra newlines before and after the current line are calculated based on the conditions provided.
2. Special cases involving decorators, flow control, imports, and yields are handled appropriately.
3. Maintain proper handling of the `max_allowed` value.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before else 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the logical issues identified in the buggy function by adjusting the newline calculations and appropriately handling special cases.
