### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line is flawed. In some cases, the function does not return the correct number of empty lines as expected. This leads to incorrect formatting decisions based on the current line's characteristics.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on various conditions like whether the current line is a decorator, flow control statement, import statement, or yield statement.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the buggy function and should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions.
