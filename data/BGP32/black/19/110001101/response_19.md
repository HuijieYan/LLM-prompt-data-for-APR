The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has some issues that need to be addressed based on the provided cases and expected output. Here's a summary of the identified problems:

1. Incorrect handling of the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed.
2. Inconsistent updates to the `before` variable.
3. Improper handling of the previous_definitions list.
4. Incorrect logic for line types like decorators, defs, and imports.

To fix the issues, we need to adjust the logic to correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed based on the given `current_line` properties and the context of the previous lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now properly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the provided inputs and logic.
