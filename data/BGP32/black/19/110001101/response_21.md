## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs in the `if current_line.depth == 0:` block. This block sets the `max_allowed` variable to 2 when it should be 1 when `current_line.depth` is 0. This causes the function to incorrectly determine the number of empty lines that should be inserted before and after the processed line, leading to incorrect output.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `max_allowed` value depending on the `current_line.depth` correctly. When `current_line.depth` is 0, `max_allowed` should be set to 1, as specified in the code comments.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth > 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function ensures that the `max_allowed` value is set correctly based on the `current_line.depth`.
