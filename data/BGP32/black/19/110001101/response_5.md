### Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. However, there are several issues in the function that may lead to incorrect output:
1. The logic for updating the `before` variable inside the `while` loop is not functioning as expected.
2. The conditions for determining the number of newlines to return are not entirely accurate.
3. The management of `self.previous_defs` list may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the following issues:
1. Correct the logic for updating the `before` variable within the `while` loop to handle depth conditions properly.
2. Adjust the conditions for determining the number of newlines based on the line types accurately.
3. Ensure the management of the `self.previous_defs` list aligns with the intended logic without causing unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and \
            not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and \
            (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues and aligns the logic with the expected behavior based on the provided test cases.
