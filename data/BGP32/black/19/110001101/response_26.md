### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for updating the `before` variable. The function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. However, the logic inside the `while` loop that updates the `before` variable based on the depth comparison is flawed. In each iteration of the loop, the `before` value is set to either 1 or 2 depending on the depth condition, which overrides the previous calculation and does not properly accumulate the correct number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `while` loop to accumulate the correct number of empty lines before the current line based on depth comparisons. Instead of overriding the `before` value in each iteration, we should increment the value based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Updated `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before += 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function properly accumulates the correct number of empty lines before the current line based on the depth comparison within the `while` loop. This should resolve the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected for all test cases.
