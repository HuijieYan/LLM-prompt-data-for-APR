## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line. The issue is with the calculation of the `newlines` variable when the `current_line` is a decorator, def, or class.

In the buggy function:
1. When the `current_line` is a decorator, def, or class, the function is incorrectly determining the number of newlines. It should account for the specific conditions and adjust the number of newlines accordingly.
2. The logic to handle decorators, defs, and classes is not properly controlling the insertion of empty lines before and after these elements.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be updated to correctly calculate the number of empty lines based on the specific conditions for decorators, defs, and classes. The logic related to decorators and other elements should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorporating the necessary fixes:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This version of the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specific conditions for decorators, defs, and classes.
