### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs in the calculation of the `before` variable. The code sets `before` to either 1 or 2 based on the `depth` value in a `while` loop a little later in the function. However, the intended behavior is to set `before` to the minimum of the current value and `max_allowed`. This is incorrect as it overrides the `max_allowed` constraint and doesn't follow the intended logic.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `before` is set to the minimum of the current value and `max_allowed`. This way, we maintain the constraint of `max_allowed` and correctly calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the correct value of `before` is calculated while maintaining the `max_allowed` constraint, fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
