### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs because when determining the number of empty lines needed before the currently processed line, the calculation is incorrect in certain cases involving decorators and flow control statements. The function is not correctly handling the conditions for inserting empty lines as per the expected logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the provided conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function now properly calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the provided conditions in the buggy class `EmptyLineTracker`.
