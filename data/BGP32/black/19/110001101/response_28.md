### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions specified in the function. However, there are inconsistencies in the logic and calculations within the function, leading to incorrect output values.

#### Issues:
1. In the case where `current_line` is a decorator, class, or function definition, the function should handle the calculation of empty lines accordingly. However, the logic inside those conditions is flawed, leading to incorrect calculations.
2. The handling of `is_decorator` flag and conditions related to decorators is not consistent and may lead to incorrect returns.
3. In the case where `self.previous_line` is not None, there are specific checks for determining the number of newlines based on certain conditions, but these checks are not correctly implemented.
4. The pop operation on `self.previous_defs` inside the while loop can cause issues if `depth` is 0.
5. The return value in the case of `current_line` being part of flow control structures, imports, or yields is not handled correctly.
6. There is inconsistency in the usage of `is_decorator` and `depth` conditions throughout the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issues in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Revise the logic for handling decorator, class, and function definitions to ensure correct calculations for empty lines.
2. Address the inconsistencies in managing `is_decorator` flag throughout the function.
3. Correct the checks related to `self.previous_line` conditions to determine the number of newlines accurately.
4. Adjust the pop operation on `self.previous_defs` inside the while loop to prevent issues when `depth` is 0.
5. Ensure that the return values in all conditional branches are accurate and follow the intended logic.
6. Make the conditions and actions based on `is_decorator` and `depth` consistent and clear.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and ensures that the function's logic follows the expected behavior based on the input parameters and conditions.
