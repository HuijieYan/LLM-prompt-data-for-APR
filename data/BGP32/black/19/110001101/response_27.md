## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic applied to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The issue lies in the handling of the `before` variable when certain conditions are met. 

In the provided function:
1. The `before` variable is initially set to the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf of the current line.
2. If the current line is a decorator, a `0` or `2` value is returned based on specific conditions.
3. If the current line is not a decorator but matches specific conditions (flow control, non-import continuation, non-yield continuation), the `before` value is used, or `1` is returned accordingly.

The issue occurs when the `before` value is modified multiple times in the same function call. As a result, the value of `before` at the function's return may not be accurate for subsequent evaluations in the function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the `before` variable retains its correct value throughout the function execution. One way to resolve this is by introducing a separate variable to store the original `before` value, so it can be used consistently until the function returns.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        original_before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            original_before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(original_before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return original_before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return original_before, 0
```

By storing the original value of `before` in the `original_before` variable, we ensure that subsequent modifications do not affect the initial value needed for specific conditions in the function's logic. This correction should resolve the bug and provide the expected results for the given test cases.
