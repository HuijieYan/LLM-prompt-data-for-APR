## Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to handle the computation of potential empty lines before and after a given line. However, there are inconsistencies in the logic which result in incorrect return values, leading to failed test cases.

### Issues
1. The function does not handle the case where `self.previous_line` is `None` properly. It should return `0, 0` in that scenario, but it does not.
2. The logic for empty lines between decorators is flawed. It should return `0, 0` if the current line is a decorator and the previous line is also a decorator, but it does not. 
3. The computation of `newlines` based on conditions related to the current line's characteristics like decorators, class, def, etc., is inconsistent and does not align with the expected behavior.
4. The handling of cases related to imports, yields, and flow control is not accurately implemented.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles scenarios where `self.previous_line` is `None`.
2. Fix the logic for empty lines between decorators.
3. Reevaluate and correct the computation logic for determining the number of empty lines based on the current line's attributes.
4. Update the conditions for imports, yields, and flow control to align with expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By fixing the identified issues and realigning the logic with the expected behavior, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and provide the expected output for the given inputs.
