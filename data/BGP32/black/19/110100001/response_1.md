## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The bug seems to be related to the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
- The bug may cause incorrect spacing between lines in the output.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when calculating the number of empty lines needed based on different conditions such as the depth of the line, presence of leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.
- The logic inside the function may not correctly handle all possible scenarios causing incorrect calculation of empty lines.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Review the logic of `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that all conditions are properly handled to determine the correct number of empty lines.
- Specifically check the handling of decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure proper spacing between lines based on these conditions.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

## Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is adjusted to properly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line, based on various criteria.
- The changes aim to ensure correct spacing between lines in the output, addressing the bug present in the original version of the function.
