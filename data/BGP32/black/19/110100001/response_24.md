The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug causes incorrect handling of empty lines in certain cases, leading to incorrect formatting.

The potential error locations in the buggy function are mainly in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line. Specifically, the conditions and calculations for `newlines` and `before` variables need to be reviewed for correctness.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the improper handling of certain cases in the function logic, leading to incorrect decisions on the number of empty lines to insert before or after the current line. This results in incorrect formatting of the code.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Review and simplify the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that the conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields are properly accounted for.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted based on the context of the current and previous lines.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, before
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1
        return before, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1
        return before, 0

    return before, newlines
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures proper handling of different scenarios to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
