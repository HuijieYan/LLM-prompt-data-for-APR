## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on several conditions. The bug seems to be related to the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The logic used to determine the number of empty lines based on different conditions is not correctly implemented.
2. There are multiple condition checks that may not handle all scenarios properly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of conditions related to different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yields) and their relationships with the previous line. The way the number of empty lines is calculated based on these conditions is causing unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line. Ensure that all conditions are properly handled and that the desired behavior, as described in the `EmptyLineTracker` class docs, is achieved.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0
        
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the buggy behavior and properly calculate the number of empty lines required based on the specified conditions. Test cases should be run to ensure that the function now passes all the required tests.
