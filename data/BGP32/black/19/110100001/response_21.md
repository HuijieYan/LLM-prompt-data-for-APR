## Analysis:
1. The `def _maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The implementation checks various conditions based on the characteristics of the `current_line` being processed to determine the number of empty lines required.
3. The bug seems to stem from the logic around determining the correct number of empty lines needed based on different scenarios.
4. The buggy function does not handle all the conditions correctly, leading to incorrect computation of the number of empty lines needed.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements. The conditions for these scenarios are not properly taken into account, leading to inaccurate results in determining the number of empty lines needed.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements. We should ensure that the conditions are checked accurately to determine the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the changes mentioned above, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. This should address the bug and ensure that the function functions correctly as intended.
