The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect handling of the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. 

The main issue is that the conditions for checking decorators, classes, flow controls, imports, and yields are not properly taken into account. Additionally, the logic for handling `before` (empty lines before the line) and `newlines` (empty lines after the line) variables needs to be adjusted to correctly calculate the required empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if not self.previous_line or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
        
    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- Conditions for decorators, classes, and flow control are checked before further evaluation.
- The correct logic is applied to determine the number of empty lines before and after the line based on various cases.
- The return values are adjusted accordingly to handle different scenarios.

This corrected version should address the issues and make the function work correctly with the given test case.
