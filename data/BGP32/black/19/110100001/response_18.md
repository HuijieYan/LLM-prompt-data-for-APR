The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to the handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function seems to be confused in determining the correct number of empty lines to insert based on various conditions.

The root cause of the bug can be due to the incorrect logic in calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The function is making decisions based on multiple conditions including the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, flow control, import, yield, etc. However, the logic seems to be convoluted and there might be overlapping or conflicting conditions leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, a simpler and more straightforward logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line should be implemented. Removing unnecessary conditional checks and simplifying the code structure can help in resolving the issue.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 1
    after = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        after = 1
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1
        
    return before, after
```

By simplifying the logic and focusing on the key conditions that determine the number of empty lines, the function should now be able to correctly calculate the required empty lines before and after the current line. This should fix the bug and make the function operate as intended.
