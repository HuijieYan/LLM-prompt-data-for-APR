### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is meant to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are few issues that need to be addressed in the function:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is not implemented correctly.
2. The condition check for `if depth` might not be functioning as expected.
3. The handling of conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` needs to be reviewed.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug seems to be related to incorrect calculations when determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. This results in incorrect output that fails a test related to comments in decorators.
2. Another potential issue could be around the condition `if depth` where it might not be behaving as intended, causing unexpected results.
3. The conditions related to different line types such as decorators, definitions, flow control, imports, and yields are not properly handled, leading to inaccurate calculations for empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is correct based on the class documentation.
2. Review the condition check for `if depth` and adjust if necessary to get the desired behavior.
3. Properly handle the conditions related to different line types to calculate the appropriate number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth: 
        max_allowed -= 1
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version aims to address the identified issues and improve the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
