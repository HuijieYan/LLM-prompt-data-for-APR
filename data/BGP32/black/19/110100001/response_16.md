The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function doesn't handle some edge cases properly, leading to incorrect calculations.

One potential cause of the bug is the manipulation of the `before` variable during the while loop block. The code inside the while loop updates the `before` variable based on certain conditions, which may not always be correct.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the line is accurate and considers all possible scenarios.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
        
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2
        
    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
                
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
                
            if depth == 0:
                return 0, 0
                
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(1, before), 0
            
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(1, before), 0
        
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function focuses on properly handling different scenarios and edge cases to ensure accurate calculation of empty lines before and after the processed line. The changes made aim to address the potential causes of the bug and ensure correct behavior based on the given class documentation and failing test.
