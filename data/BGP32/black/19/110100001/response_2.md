# Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions based on the current line and the previous line to decide the number of empty lines needed.
3. The bug is likely related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The conditions and comparisons within the function may not be correctly handling all scenarios.

# Bug Cause:
The bug likely stems from the logic used to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The conditional statements may not be correctly evaluating the different scenarios, leading to incorrect output.

# Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review each conditional statement within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly handles all possible scenarios.
2. Ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is comprehensive and covers all relevant cases.
3. Test the function with different inputs to verify that it produces the expected output in each scenario.

# Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses potential issues in the original implementation and ensures that it handles the conditions correctly.
