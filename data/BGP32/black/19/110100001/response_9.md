The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The issue seems to be with the calculation of the number of empty lines based on various conditions and the handling of different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc.).

The bug may cause incorrect handling of empty lines in certain cases, leading to formatting issues when the function is used.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review each condition and adjust the logic to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
            if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions and return statements in the function, the corrected version should address the bug and ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the context of the lines being processed. This correction should make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test provided.
