The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The issue lies in the calculation of `before` variable and the conditions for returning the number of newlines.

The bug causes incorrect calculation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, leading to failed test cases where the output does not match the expected result.

To fix the bug, the logic for calculating the `before` variable and the conditions for returning the number of newlines need to be revised. It is important to properly handle different scenarios based on the current line's attributes and the previous line's attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:        
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
