The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling the `before` variable and the conditions for returning the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

The bug occurs when attempting to handle the number of empty lines before the current line by checking the `before` variable in various conditions. The issue is that the logic for `before` is not consistent and might not always return the correct number of empty lines before the current line.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is correctly initialized based on the conditions.
2. Keep track of the correct number of empty lines before the current line in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1][0] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append((depth, 0))
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is properly handled and the number of empty lines before the current line is accurately calculated in each scenario.
