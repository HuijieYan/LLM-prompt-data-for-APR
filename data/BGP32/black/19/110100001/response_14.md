## Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is expected to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the implementation that are causing it to fail the test. 

## Identified Issues:
1. The condition for checking `current_line.depth` is incorrect, leading to incorrect assignment of `max_allowed`.
2. Modifications to `before` and `depth` variables are not properly handled based on the conditions.
3. The logic for checking various line types and returning the appropriate newlines count is not consistent.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of line types and their depth, leading to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 

## Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly assign `max_allowed` based on the condition for `current_line.depth`.
2. Update the logic for modifying `before` and `depth` variables based on different conditions.
3. Ensure consistent handling and proper return of newlines count for different line types.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, and pass the failing test.
