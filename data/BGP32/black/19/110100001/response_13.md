## Analysis:
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- There are multiple conditions inside the function that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the type of line being processed.

## Bugs identified:
1. In the condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:`, the logic for setting `before` is incorrect. It should be outside the while loop.
2. In the condition `if current_line.depth:` where the number of newlines is calculated, the logic is incorrectly calculating the number of newlines.
3. In the condition `if current_line.is_flow_control:`, the return statement is swapping the values for `before` and `newlines`.
4. In the condition where `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`, the logic for setting `newlines` is incorrect.

## Bug Cause:
The bugs arise due to incorrect logic and handling of conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. These bugs lead to incorrect calculation of the number of extra empty lines needed.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Move the assignment for `before` outside the while loop to prevent multiple assignments and ensure correct handling.
2. Correct the calculation logic for determining the number of newlines to be inserted based on conditions.
3. Swap the correct values for `before` and `newlines` in the condition `if current_line.is_flow_control:`.
4. Fix the logic for setting `newlines` under the condition of `current_line.is_import`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return 0, newlines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, before

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 0 if before else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 0 if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above correction, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly determine the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
