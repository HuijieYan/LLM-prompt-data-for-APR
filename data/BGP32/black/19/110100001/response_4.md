## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several potential error locations that may cause it to fail the test. Some of the issues include incorrect handling of indentation levels, improper checking of line types (e.g., decorator, flow control), and misalignment of newlines.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may cause incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This can result in formatting issues, especially when dealing with decorators, flow control statements, and yield statements. The function fails to properly handle these cases, leading to unexpected results.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revise the logic to accurately determine the number of empty lines required based on different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yield statements. Properly managing the indentation levels and checking the line types will be crucial for resolving the issue.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
            
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have adjusted the logic to handle different cases appropriately, ensuring the correct calculation of empty lines before and after the current line. This updated version should pass the failing test.
