## Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a `_maybe_empty_lines` method that determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The method contains logic to handle different scenarios based on the properties of the `current_line`.
3. Potential error locations:
   - Incorrect handling of `depth` property.
   - Logic for calculating the number of newlines before and after the current line.
4. The bug may be causing incorrect insertion of empty lines in certain scenarios, leading to the failing test.
5. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Properly handle the `depth` property for different types of lines.
   - Ensure correct logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth > 0:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.is_import:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_yield:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the handling of `depth`, updating the logic for determining newlines, and making adjustments to the conditions based on the line properties, the corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines` should pass the failing test.
