## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function considers various conditions based on the type of the current line and its relationship with the previous line.
3. The bug may lie in the logic used to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line, particularly in cases where the previous line is a decorator or an import.
4. The bug might be causing incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed, leading to failures in certain test cases.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may be caused by the incorrect handling of conditions where the previous line is a decorator or an import. This can result in the function returning an incorrect number of empty lines, causing the test cases to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully evaluate the conditions in the function related to decorators, imports, and other special cases. Ensure that the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line is correct based on the given requirements and context. Make necessary adjustments to address the issues identified in the faulty logic.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions related to decorators, imports, and other special cases have been carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure correct calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
