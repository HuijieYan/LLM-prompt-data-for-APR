## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` test failed due to differences in the number of empty lines in the expected output and the actual output. This suggests that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not handling the empty lines correctly, leading to a mismatch in the final formatted output.

## Bug Location:
The bug might be in the logic that calculates the number of empty lines to insert before a line. The issue could be related to how the function is determining when to insert empty lines based on the current line's properties.

## Bug Cause:
1. The calculation of `newlines` based on whether the current line is a decorator, definition, or class might not be accurate.
2. Handling of `before` to track the number of empty lines before the line might not be correctly updating in certain conditions.
3. Conditions related to import and yield statements might not be correctly handled, causing incorrect empty line insertions.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert based on different line properties.
2. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions.
3. Verify the conditions related to import and yield statements to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1  # Updated to always insert 1 empty line for decorators, defs, and classes
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0  # Updated to always insert 1 empty line for yield statements

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in various scenarios, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
