## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines()` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line being processed. The function checks various conditions like depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to calculate the number of empty lines.

## Bug:
The bug in the function seems to be with the logic around handling imports and yield statements. When determining the number of empty lines before the current line, the function incorrectly handles the cases of imports and yields, leading to incorrect formatting.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Fix the logic related to handling imports and yields to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are added based on the conditions provided.
2. Make sure the handling of import statements relative to the previous line is accurate to maintain the correct formatting.
3. Update the conditions for determining the number of empty lines in a concise and clear manner.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions related to imports and yields as well as ensuring a clear logic flow for determining the number of empty lines, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function should now pass the failing test.
