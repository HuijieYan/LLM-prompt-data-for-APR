## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to calculate the number of empty lines that should be inserted before a given line in a Python code. The error message from the failing test indicates that the function is not handling the insertion of empty lines properly in some cases, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the logic within the function that determines the number of empty lines to insert before a line. There are multiple conditions and checks in the function that may not be correctly handling certain scenarios, resulting in incorrect insertion of empty lines.

## Bug Cause:
The function does not properly differentiate between different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc.) and apply the correct logic for handling empty lines. This inconsistency in handling different line types leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines and ultimately leads to failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle different types of lines and determine the correct number of empty lines to insert based on the context of the code. We need to ensure that each type of line is handled appropriately and that the function returns the correct number of empty lines to be inserted.

## Fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

## Changes Made:
1. Added a check to handle consecutive decorators without inserting empty lines between them.
2. Revised the logic to correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before certain line types like decorators, classes, and functions.
3. Adjusted the logic for handling flow control, import, and yield lines to ensure correct insertion of empty lines.
4. Fixed the return values to accurately reflect the number of empty lines to be inserted.

By making these changes, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should now handle different line types and context appropriately, leading to correct insertion of empty lines and passing the failing test case.
