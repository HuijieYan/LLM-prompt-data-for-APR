## Analysis:
The error message indicates a failing test asserting the equality of two strings: `expected` and `actual`. The issue seems to be related to the output formatting of the function `_maybe_empty_lines()`, which is impacting the formatting of the output code.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function is related to the logic for handling empty lines before or after specific types of code elements. This logic is affecting the output formatting of the code, causing differences between the expected and actual outputs of the test.

## Potential Bug Location:
The bug could potentially be in the logic related to handling empty lines before decorators, class definitions, flow control statements, and imports. The incorrect calculation and handling of empty lines in these cases could lead to formatting discrepancies.

## Bug Cause:
The incorrect handling of empty line insertion before or after specific code elements, along with the manipulation of line indentation depths, is causing the formatting mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and modify the logic for handling empty lines before decorators, class definitions, flow control statements, and imports.
2. Ensure that the logic for managing empty lines maintains proper line indentation and formatting to align with the expected output.
3. Consider refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Handle the case when current_line has leaves
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update the previous_defs based on depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    # Handle the cases of decorators, defs, and classes
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth)
        return max(newlines, 0), 0

    # Handle flow control statements
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Handle imports and yields
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function as shown above, the function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly before and after different types of code elements, ensuring that the formatted output aligns with the expected output.
