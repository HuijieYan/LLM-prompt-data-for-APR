### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing extra newlines to be added in certain cases where they shouldn't be. This is leading to a formatting mismatch in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator`. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling `before` value updates within the while loop.
2. The conditions for when to return newlines and indentation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `before` value is being incorrectly updated within the while loop, causing extra newlines to be inserted in cases where they are not expected. This results in a formatting mismatch in the test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for updating the `before` value within the while loop to ensure it behaves correctly.
2. Review the conditions for when to return newlines and indentation to make sure they align with the formatting requirements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the logic for updating the `before` value within the while loop and adjusting the conditions for returning newlines and indentation, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case.
