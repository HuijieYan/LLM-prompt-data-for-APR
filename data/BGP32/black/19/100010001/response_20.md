### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line.
2. The error message indicates a mismatch in the number of empty lines added before certain lines, leading to a failing test.
3. The bug might be related to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to be added based on the line properties.
   
### Bug Description:
In the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, there seems to be an issue with how empty lines are calculated and inserted based on the properties of the current and previous lines. This results in an incorrect number of empty lines being added before certain lines, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic for calculating empty lines based on different line properties.
2. Ensure that the conditions for adding empty lines are correctly implemented.
3. Check if the logic for handling special cases like decorators, imports, yield statements, etc., is accurate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Adjusted the logic inside the `while` loop to correctly set the `before` variable based on the depth value.
2. Ensured that the correct number of empty lines is handled when popping previous definitions.
3. Added a check to consider depth 0 when popping previous definitions.
4. Updated the logic to handle cases where empty lines should not be inserted in specific scenarios like decorators, imports, yield statements, etc.

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now calculate and insert empty lines correctly based on the line properties, addressing the bug reported in the failing test.
