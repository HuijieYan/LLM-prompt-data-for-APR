### Analysis:
- The error message indicates an AssertionError in the `assertFormatEqual` method in the test.
- The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` compares the expected result with the actual result, but they are not matching.
- The error occurs specifically when dealing with comments in decorators.

### Bug Cause:
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the code is not handling comment lines within decorators properly.
- When encountering a comment line in a decorator, the function is not inserting empty lines as expected, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to modify the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle comment lines within decorators.
- Ensure that the function correctly inserts empty lines before or after comments within decorators as required.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        and current_line.is_comment
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

### Fix Explanation:
- Added a new condition to check if the previous line was a decorator and the current line is a comment.
- If the above condition is met, insert an empty line before the comment line within the decorator.
- This change ensures that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function handles comments in decorators properly and passes the failing test case.
