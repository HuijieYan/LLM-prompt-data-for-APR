## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output in terms of empty lines between comments and decorators.

## Issues:
1. The logic for handling empty lines before decorators, comments, and other types of lines is incorrect.
2. Inconsistent handling of different line types in the function.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of different types of lines, such as decorators, comments, and imports. The function does not properly determine the correct number of empty lines based on the type of current and previous lines.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for inserting empty lines before decorators, comments, and imports based on their specific requirements.
2. Ensure consistency in handling different line types to avoid unexpected results.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_empty_lines_before = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_empty_lines_before = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_empty_lines_before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines_before, newlines_after = 2, 0
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines_before -= 1
        return newlines_before, newlines_after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately handle different types of lines and their requirements, the corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
