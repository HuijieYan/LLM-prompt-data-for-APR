### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how it handles the insertion of empty lines in the code formatting process. The error message indicates a discrepancy in the number of empty lines being inserted between lines, resulting in a failed test.

### Issue:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in various scenarios, leading to incorrect formatting and causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic for handling empty lines in different scenarios.
2. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the conditions specified.
3. Check the conditions for not inserting empty lines in specific cases.
4. Adjust the logic to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines to match the expected formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
        return newlines, before

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Adjusted the logic for inserting empty lines before decorators, functions, and classes to align with the expected behavior.
2. Updated the calculation of the number of newlines to insert based on the depth of the current line.
3. Fixed the conditions for not inserting empty lines between decorators.
4. Corrected the handling of imports and yields to ensure the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted.

By applying these changes, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test and format the code properly.
