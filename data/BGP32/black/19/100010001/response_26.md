The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing an incorrect number of empty lines to be inserted in the output, leading to a failing test case. The function is responsible for deciding on the number of empty lines to insert before a particular line based on various conditions.

One potential error location in the function is where the `before` variable is set to 1 or 2 depending on the value of depth. The bug lies in the following segment of code:
```python
while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
    self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2
```
The assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` should be `before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2` to correctly check if `depth` is equal to 0.

The cause of the bug is that in the current implementation, the `before` variable is incorrectly assigned a value based on `depth` in all cases, leading to incorrect handling of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` should be replaced with `before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2`. This change ensures that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the depth of the current line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines and pass the failing test case.
