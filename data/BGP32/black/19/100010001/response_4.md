### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The error message indicates that the formatting between the expected output and the actual output is not matching. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain scenarios.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect calculation of empty lines before decorators, `def`, and `class` statements.
2. Handling of empty lines for flow control statements.
3. Checking for imports and yields and their corresponding empty lines.
4. Handling of previous definitions based on depth.

### Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused by incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to insert in various scenarios. For example, it seems like the function is not handling empty lines correctly before decorators and is not considering all edge cases for determining when to insert empty lines.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the function handles the insertion of empty lines properly before decorators, `def`, and `class` statements.
2. Fix the logic for handling empty lines for flow control statements.
3. Identify and correct the logic for handling empty lines based on imports and yields.
4. Adjust the handling of previous definitions based on depth to align with the desired formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth else 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines += 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

Please replace the existing `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the corrected version provided above to fix the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
