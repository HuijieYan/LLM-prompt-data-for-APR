### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test is failing due to incorrect handling of newlines in the output. The expected and actual outputs have differing numbers of newlines in certain parts, causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines to insert in certain cases, leading to discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function correctly calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions specified.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After making these corrections, the function should correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on the specified conditions, resolving the bug and allowing the test to pass successfully.
