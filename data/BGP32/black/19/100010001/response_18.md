### Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the assertion failed when comparing the expected output with the actual output in the test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
- The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of empty lines within the code being processed.
- The function `_maybe_empty_lines` determines the number of empty lines to insert before a given line based on certain conditions.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of line depths and the number of empty lines to insert before certain lines.
- The function is not correctly updating the `before` variable based on the conditions specified, resulting in incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to correctly maintain the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions specified in the function.
- Update the logic for updating the `before` variable based on the conditions and make sure it reflects the correct number of empty lines to be inserted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
