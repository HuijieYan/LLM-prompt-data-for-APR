### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how empty lines are handled before and after different types of statements in the code. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output related to empty lines in the code.

### Potential Errors:
1. The logic for handling empty lines before and after different types of statements might be incorrect.
2. The conditions for determining the number of empty lines to be added might be flawed.
3. There could be issues with how the previous line is being taken into account for adding empty lines.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines to add before or after different types of statements in the code. This is leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the conditions and logic for adding empty lines before and after statements to ensure they are correctly handling different scenarios.
2. Check how the previous line is considered when deciding on adding empty lines.
3. Make sure to properly handle cases like decorators, imports, flow control statements, etc., where the number of empty lines might vary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Change made:
1. Updated the condition in the `while` loop to correctly handle the before condition.
2. Updated the condition for determining `newlines` value when checking for decorators.
3. Corrected the condition for checking `depth` value in the `is_decorator` check.

### With these changes, the function should now handle the empty lines correctly and pass the failing test.
