## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect handling of the `depth` variable in the comparison logic. The function is not correctly updating the `before` variable based on the value of `depth`. This leads to incorrect calculations and returns in some cases where empty lines should be inserted.

In particular, in cases where `is_decorator` is True or `is_def` or `is_class` are True, the function should check for the depth of the current line and update the `before` value accordingly. However, the code mistakenly sets `before` to 1 if `depth` is true, which is not the intended behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to properly handle the update of the `before` variable based on the value of `depth`. We should check if `depth` is non-zero and update `before` accordingly while maintaining the correct values for other conditions.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version properly handles the `depth` variable when updating the `before` value and ensures that empty lines are inserted as needed based on the conditions specified in the function.
