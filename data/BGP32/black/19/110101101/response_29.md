### Bug Explanation:
The bug is related to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is not correctly calculating the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on certain conditions. This results in incorrect line spacing in the formatted output.

In the failing test cases provided, the function fails to correctly handle scenarios where the current line is a decorator or a def statement, causing the incorrect number of empty lines to be returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle scenarios involving decorators and def statements. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function returns the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions specified.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.is_def:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    previous_line = self.previous_line
    if previous_line:
        if current_line.is_decorator and previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    newlines = 2 if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class else 1
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    
    return newlines, 0
```

This updated version should address the issues in the original function and ensure correct line spacing based on the specified conditions.
