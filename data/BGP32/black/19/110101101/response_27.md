### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is intended to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the current implementation that are causing the failing test cases:
1. In some cases, the function returns incorrect values for the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. The handling of `is_decorator` condition and the manipulation of `previous_defs` list are causing inconsistencies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Refactor the logic to accurately determine the number of extra empty lines needed based on the current line characteristics.
2. Ensure that the conditions for handling decorators, previous line comparisons, and other attributes are properly evaluated and handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By following these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now provide the correct number of extra empty lines needed before and after the current line, satisfying the expected input/output values for all test cases.
