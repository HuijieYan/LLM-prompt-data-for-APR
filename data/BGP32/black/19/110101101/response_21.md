## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic related to the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line. The function incorrectly handles scenarios where there should be no empty lines inserted or specific conditions where the number of empty lines should vary.

In Case 1, the function fails to return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line when it is a decorator. Instead of returning `(0, 0)`, the function returns `(2, 0)` when it should not insert any empty lines.

In Case 7, the function incorrectly updates the `before` value when dealing with a `def` line. The value of `before` should remain `0` but it is updated to `1` in this case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the conditional logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line based on the specific scenarios outlined in the failing test cases.

The following corrections need to be made:
1. Return `(0, 0)` when the current line is a decorator to avoid inserting unnecessary empty lines.
2. Keep the `before` value as `0` when dealing with `def` lines to prevent erroneously updating it to `1`.

## Updated Code

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        # For decorators, no empty lines should be inserted
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (0, 0)

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (0, 0)

    return 0, 0
