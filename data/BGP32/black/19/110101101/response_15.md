## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the logic to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug causes incorrect behavior in cases where it should return specific values for `newlines` and `before`.

### Issues:
1. At the end of the function, the default return for cases where none of the specific conditions are met is `(before, 0)`. However, this can potentially overwrite the correct values for `newlines` that should have been set earlier in the function.

2. In the case where `self.previous_line` is None, the function should return `(0, 0)`, but it is currently returning `(before, 0)` which is leading to incorrect output.

3. In the `while` loop condition where it checks for `depth`, it should set `before` to `2` if `depth != 0`, but it currently sets it to `1` which is incorrect.

4. The logic for handling decorators and other specific cases is not consistent and might be causing incorrect returns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the values for `newlines` and `before` are appropriately calculated and returned based on the conditions specified in the function.

2. Check the logic for handling specific cases such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., and make sure they return the correct values for `newlines` and `before`.

3. Make sure to handle the case where `self.previous_line` is None separately and return `(0, 0)` in that scenario.

4. Verify that the `while` loop condition correctly sets `before` to `2` when `depth != 0`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return newlines, max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"))
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the various cases properly and provide the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.
