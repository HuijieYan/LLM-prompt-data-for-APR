## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect logic when determining the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the current line being processed. The function is intended to calculate the appropriate number of empty lines based on various conditions, such as the current line's characteristics and the previous line's attributes.

The bug is primarily in the logic flow of the function, where certain condition checks and variable assignments are not properly aligned with the expected behavior. This leads to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully review each conditional statement and variable assignment to ensure they are correctly capturing the intended behavior. Specifically, we should focus on:

1. Ensuring that the `max_allowed` value is correctly updated based on the `current_line.depth` value.
2. Properly handling cases related to decorators, definitions, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields to calculate the correct number of empty lines needed.
3. Adjusting the logic to update the `before` and `newlines` variables based on the conditions of the current line and the previous line.

By addressing these issues and aligning the logic with the expected behavior, we can create a fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that accurately determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues in the logic flow and ensures that the calculations for empty lines before and after the current line are correct based on the different conditions.
