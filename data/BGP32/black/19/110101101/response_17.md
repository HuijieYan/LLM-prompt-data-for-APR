The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the calculation for inserting extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line is incorrect in some cases leading to unexpected output. The function's logic for handling decorators, imports, flow control, and yielding is flawed, resulting in incorrect behavior during the tests.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on the specific conditions such as decorators, imports, flow control, and yielding.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the different cases identified in the failing tests and produce the expected output.
