## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line in certain conditions. The function has several conditions and checks that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted, such as the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, a flow control statement, an import statement, or a yield statement.

In Case 1, the input parameters indicate that the current line is a decorator (is_decorator=True) with a depth of 0. The function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines needed before and after the line, resulting in an incorrect return value.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of empty lines required before and after the current line based on the specific conditions in the code. We need to review each condition and ensure that it is correctly handling the different scenarios to determine the appropriate number of newlines.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line in various scenarios, ensuring that the tests pass and the expected output values are met.
