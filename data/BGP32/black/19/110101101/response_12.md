The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic of determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line. Based on the analysis of the runtime values and expected values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the cases where the current line is a decorator or a flow control statement. Additionally, the logic for handling previous definitions and imports might be causing incorrect outputs in certain scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately determine the number of empty lines to be added based on the current line type and context.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line):
        if current_line.is_decororator() or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        
        return 0, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified in the buggy function and ensure that it produces the expected output for the given test cases.
