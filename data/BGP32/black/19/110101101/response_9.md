## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. In multiple cases, the function is returning incorrect values for the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions met in the code.

### Issues in the buggy function:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines based on `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` conditions is incorrect.
2. The handling of `self.previous_defs` list is causing incorrect behavior in determining the number of empty lines to insert.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to correct the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is updated and used correctly to track the depth of previous lines for inserting empty lines.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < depth]
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the function and ensuring proper handling of the `self.previous_defs` list, the function should now return correct values for the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases provided.
