## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The issue arises when computing the value of `before` in the function. The calculation of `before` is overridden within the while loop, which leads to incorrect values being set.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the variable `before` retains its correct value and is not overridden in the while loop. We should adjust the logic to update `before` only in specific scenarios without losing the original value.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    previous_defs_to_remove = []
    for prev_def in self.previous_defs:
        if prev_def >= depth:
            previous_defs_to_remove.append(prev_def)
    for prev_def in previous_defs_to_remove:
        self.previous_defs.remove(prev_def)
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

After applying the above correction, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line without overriding the `before` value unnecessarily.
