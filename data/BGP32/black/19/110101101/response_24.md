## Bug analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The function has logic to handle different scenarios such as decorators, flow controls, imports, yields, etc. However, based on the failing test cases and runtime input/output values, it is clear that the function is not correctly handling some cases leading to incorrect empty line calculations.

### Issues in the buggy function:
1. The logic for handling previous definitions and decorators is incorrect, leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines.
2. The conditions for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line need to be revised.

### Bug cause:
The bug in the function is primarily due to incorrect handling of previous definitions and decorators. The function is not properly tracking the depth levels and decorators, leading to wrong calculations of empty lines in certain scenarios.

## Fix strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling previous definitions and decorators to ensure correct tracking of depth levels.
2. Revise the conditions for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line based on different scenarios.

## Corrected function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        line_depth = current_line.depth
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return before, after

        indentation = 1 if line_depth > 0 else 0
        after = 1 - indentation

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(line_depth)

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 1

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        before = 1

    return before, after
```

In the corrected function, the logic for handling decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields is adjusted to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions. This should address the issues identified and ensure the function produces the expected results for all test cases.
