## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. However, there are issues in the logic implementation that are causing the failing test cases.

1. In Cases 1, 3, and 6, when the current line is a decorator, the function is not returning the expected values for `newlines`. It should return 0 newlines before the line for decorators.
   
2. In Case 7, when the current line is a function definition, the function is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly. It should push the depth of the function definition to the `previous_defs` stack.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for decorators and function definitions based on the identified issues. Specifically:
- Update the logic for decorators to return the correct number of newlines.
- Update the logic for function definitions to handle the insertion of empty lines correctly.

Let's implement the bug fixes in the corrected version of the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for decorators and function definitions, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output for different scenarios.
