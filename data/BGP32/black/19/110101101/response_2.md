## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not handling the logic correctly for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is intended to calculate the number of empty lines based on certain conditions related to indentation depth, line type, and previous line attributes. However, due to incorrect logic and missing conditions, the function is returning incorrect values in some cases.

### Issues with the buggy function:
1. In the `elif` block for when the line is a decorator, there is a mistake in determining the condition for when to insert empty lines. The function is returning `0, 0` in some cases where it should be returning different values.
2. Some of the conditional statements related to flow control, imports, and yields are not properly handled, leading to incorrect return values.
  
## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the line. Ensure that each conditional statement is properly checked and returns the expected values based on the given input parameters and previous line attributes.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return 0, 0
```

By updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specified conditions and return the expected values in all cases.
