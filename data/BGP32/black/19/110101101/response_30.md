### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the handling of the `before` variable. In the cases where `self.previous_defs` is not empty and the loop is triggered, the value of `before` is being overwritten with either 1 or 2 based on the condition. This leads to the loss of the original value of `before`. Consequently, in subsequent return statements, the incorrect value of `before` is being used, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to preserve the original value of `before` before entering the `while` loop and adjust the behavior inside the loop so that it doesn't overwrite the original value. By properly handling the `before` variable, we can ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions.

### The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    original_before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        original_before = before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return original_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return original_before, 0
```

By preserving the original value of `before` and using `original_before` when necessary, we ensure that the correct behavior is maintained and the correct number of empty lines are inserted as expected based on the conditions. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
