The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before certain types of lines such as decorators, defs, classes, and flow control statements. The function is not correctly calculating and returning the appropriate number of empty lines in these cases, leading to failing test cases.

The bug seems to be that in some cases, the logic for determining the number of empty lines is incorrect and not following the expected behavior for different types of lines. This results in incorrect output values for the function, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug:
1. Make sure to handle the different types of lines (decorators, defs, classes, flow control statements, imports, yields) separately and return the correct number of empty lines accordingly.
2. Be mindful of the conditions and rules specified in the test cases to determine the number of empty lines in each case.
3. Update the logic inside the function to align with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Handling conditions for decorators, defs, and classes
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Handling condition for flow control statements
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Handling condition for changes from imports to non-imports
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Handling condition for changes from yields to non-yields
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected number of empty lines based on the input line types.
