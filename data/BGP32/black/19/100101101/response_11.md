## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect logic within the conditional statements that determine the number of newlines to be inserted before the current line. In particular, the issue lies in how the `before` variable is being updated within the `while` loop that checks for previous definitions with `self.previous_defs`. The logic inside the loop is overriding the intended behavior of updating `before` based on the depth of the previous definitions.

In Case 1, where `current_line.depth == 0` and `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, the expected behavior based on the input parameters and the function logic should set `max_allowed` to `2` and update `before` to `0` correctly. However, due to the faulty logic within the while loop, `before` gets overridden to `2` in the final return statement.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, the while loop logic needs to be adjusted to correctly update the `before` value based on the depth of the previous definitions. Instead of setting `before = 1 if depth else 2` inside the loop, we should update `before` according to the depth of the previous definitions before exiting the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the cases mentioned and provide the expected output values.
