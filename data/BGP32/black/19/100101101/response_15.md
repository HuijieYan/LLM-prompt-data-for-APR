The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue arises when handling the check for decorators and definitions, which is not being handled correctly. The function is not updating the `before` variable correctly when certain conditions are met, leading to incorrect empty line insertion.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before the current line needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the code block handling decorators and definitions should be revised to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth > 0:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the conditions correctly and return the expected number of empty lines before the current line, addressing the bug.
