## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a specific line. The function incorrectly handles the cases related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

1. For case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the scenario where `current_line` is a decorator line. It should return the correct number of newlines to insert before the decorator line based on the depth of the current line.

2. For case 2, the function incorrectly inserts empty lines before the line with a comment, which should not require any empty lines before it.

3. For case 3, the function fails to handle the scenario where the previous line is a decorator but does not correctly check for that condition to avoid inserting empty lines before the current line.

4. For case 4, the function fails to handle the scenario where the `current_line` is not a decorator but should have one empty line before it despite the `depth` value.

5. For case 5, the function incorrectly identifies the previous line as the line with a different comment when determining if there should be empty lines before the current line.

6. For case 6, the function incorrectly sets the number of empty lines based on the depth of the current line when it should consider other conditions.

7. For case 7, the function does not insert the correct number of empty lines before a "def" line based on the depth and previous definitions.

8. For case 8, the function fails to properly handle the scenario where the `current_line` has a depth of 1 and should not insert any empty lines before it.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the issues in the function's logic that lead to failing tests. The function should correctly handle different scenarios based on the type of line and specific conditions related to decorators, imports, flow control, etc.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.leaves and current_line.leaves[0].type == 153:  # Check for comments
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_class or current_line.is_def:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 1, 0

        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the different scenarios correctly and pass the failing tests by returning the expected number of empty lines before each specific type of line based on the given conditions.
