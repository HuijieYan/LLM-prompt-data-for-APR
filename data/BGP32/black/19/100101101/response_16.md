## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the current line's properties like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. In particular, the logic for handling decorators and flow control statements is causing the function to return incorrect values. 

For example, in Case 6, when `current_line` is a decorator, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert resulting in an incorrect return value. The same issue arises in other cases when handling different line types.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function logic should be adjusted to correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on the different line properties. The conditions for handling decorators, flow control statements, imports, and other cases should be revisited to ensure the correct behavior.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic for handling decorators, flow control statements, imports, and other cases, the corrected function should now return the correct number of empty lines to insert based on the properties of the current line. This correction should resolve the issues observed in failing tests.
