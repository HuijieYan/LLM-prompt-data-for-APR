## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the logic related to handling empty lines in certain conditions. The function is intended to calculate the number of empty lines before the current line based on various conditions like decorators, import statements, flow control statements, etc.

### Issues Identified:
1. In case 1, the function incorrectly returns `newlines, 0` when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True` and `current_line.is_def is False`. This implies that multiple newlines will be inserted in this scenario, which may not be desired behavior.
2. In case 3, the function calculates `newlines = 2` regardless of the current line's depth. This results in incorrectly inserting two newlines when dealing with decorators.
3. In case 7, the function incorrectly appends `depth` to `self.previous_defs` before checking if `is_decorator` is `True`. This appends the incorrect depth value and may lead to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for determining the number of newlines based on decorators and other conditions in the function.
2. Ensure that the depth is correctly handled when deciding the number of newlines to insert.
3. Verify the order of operations to make sure that depth is processed correctly before updating `self.previous_defs`.

## Bug-Fixed Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic for handling decorators and the calculation of newlines based on depth, the bug-fixed version of the function should now correctly handle the scenarios provided in the failing test cases.
