## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the insertion of empty lines in formatted code based on certain conditions. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to failing tests. Here is a summary of the bugs identified based on the analysis of the provided code, failing test cases, and expected outcomes:

1. In Case 2, if there are no leaves in the current line, the function fails to correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before the line. The `before` variable remains 0 instead of being updated based on the condition when there are no leaves.

2. In Case 6, when the current line should not have any empty lines inserted before it, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines (`newlines = 2`), leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted.

3. In Case 7, when the current line is a function definition, the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before the line based on the specified conditions. This results in an incorrect behavior for determining whether empty lines should be inserted.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the identified bugs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following strategy can be employed:
1. Update the condition to correctly determine when the `before` variable should be updated for empty lines. Ensure that the `before` variable is properly calculated based on the conditions of the current line.

2. Address the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to insert (`newlines`) in cases where no empty lines should be inserted. Adjust the logic to accurately set the number of empty lines based on the conditions.

3. Correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before function definition lines by ensuring that the appropriate checks are made to determine if empty lines should be inserted according to the specified conditions.

## Corrected Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.leaves:  # Bug Fix 1: Handle case where there are no leaves in current line
        before = max_allowed
    else:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else max_allowed

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying the bug fix strategy and updating the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as outlined above, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected outcomes for all identified failing test cases.
