## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the handling of the `before` variable. The function incorrectly assigns a value to `before` based on the conditions inside the `while` loop. This results in incorrect behavior when determining the number of newlines to return.

1. In Case 1, the value of `before` is set to `0` at the beginning of the function. However, inside the `while` loop, the value of `before` is reassigned to `1` or `2` based on the condition. This discrepancy causes the function to return incorrect values for newlines.

2. In Case 7, the function correctly updates the `previous_defs` list, but the value of `before` is not set under any condition, leading to unexpected return values.

## Bug Fix
To address the bug:
- Initialize `before` outside the `while` loop with an appropriate default value.
- Update the `while` loop condition to correctly determine the value of `before`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version should now appropriately handle the conditions and return the expected values, thus passing the failing tests.
