## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to incorrect handling of the logic related to determining the number of empty lines before a line. The function calculates the number of empty lines based on various conditions such as the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, def, class, flow control, import, or yield statement. However, there are issues with the implementation where the logic does not match the expected behavior.

### Issues:
1. In Case 1 and Case 3, when the `current_line` is a decorator, the function should check if it is not the first line in the file and return 0 newlines if it is. This condition is correctly identified, but the logic to handle the depth is incorrect when calculating the number of newlines. It should check for `current_line.depth` only when the `current_line` is not a decorator.

2. In Case 2, there is an issue with the logic where the function incorrectly assumes that the previous line is a decorator, which is not the case in the provided input. This incorrect assumption leads to the wrong calculation of the number of newlines to be inserted.

3. In Case 4 and Case 5, the function incorrectly handles the logic related to empty newlines before the line when the current line is not a decorator. It should consider the depth of the current line and previous line for correctly calculating the number of newlines.

4. In Case 6, the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines when the `current_line` is a decorator. It should handle the depth and number of newlines differently for decorators.

5. In Case 7, the logic for handling the `current_line` being a function definition is incorrect as it always appends the current line's depth to `previous_defs` list without considering the actual depth comparison. This incorrect appending leads to wrong decisions about the number of newlines.

6. In Case 8, when the `current_line` has a depth of 1, the function incorrectly sets the `max_allowed` value to 1 which is causing issues in determining the number of empty lines to insert before the line.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the cases based on the conditions specified in the implementation. Here's a strategy to improve the function:
1. Identify when to check the depth of the current line and consider it in appropriate cases.
2. Ensure correct handling of decorators, def, class, flow control, import, and yield statements to determine the number of newlines to insert.
3. Update the logic to accurately calculate the number of newlines based on the conditions specified for each case.
4. Address the issues in depth comparison and adjust the calculations accordingly.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.depth == 1:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the function as outlined above, the issues related to incorrect calculations based on different conditions should be resolved. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior.
