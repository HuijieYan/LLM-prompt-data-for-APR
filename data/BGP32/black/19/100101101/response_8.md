## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the calculation of `before` variable. The calculation logic involving `before` value modification and comparison with `max_allowed` is causing incorrect results in determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. This bug is observed in multiple test cases where the expected values of `before` do not match the actual calculated values.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on the specified conditions. The `before` variable calculation should be adjusted to account for the specific scenarios outlined in the function.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic for handling the `before` variable and considering the specific conditions in the function, we can ensure that the corrected function behaves correctly and passes the failing test cases.
