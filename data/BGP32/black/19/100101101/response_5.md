The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the incorrect handling of the `before` variable when there are multiple previous definitions with the same depth. The function calculates the `before` value as `1` if the depth is non-zero and `2` otherwise, leading to incorrect empty line insertion in some cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for determining the `before` value when there are multiple previous definitions with the same depth. We can update the `before` value based on the maximum allowed empty lines if the depth is non-zero, ensuring that it follows the correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue with incorrect empty line insertion when dealing with multiple previous definitions with the same depth.
