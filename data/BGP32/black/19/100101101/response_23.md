### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic used to handle when to insert empty lines based on various conditions. In some scenarios, the function incorrectly returns values that do not align with the expected behavior, leading to failing tests. The issue mainly arises from incorrect handling of the `before` variable and the conditions used to determine when to insert empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly determine the number of newlines to insert before the current line based on the conditions specified. This involves ensuring that the `before` variable is appropriately updated in all scenarios and that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the context of the current line.

### Corrected Version of `_maybe_empty_lines`
```python
# Corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to the logic within the function, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the current line and the conditions specified. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and align with the expected behavior of the function.
