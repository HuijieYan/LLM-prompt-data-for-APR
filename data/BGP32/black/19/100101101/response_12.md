## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function due to incorrect handling of empty lines when processing different line types. The function fails to properly identify when to insert empty lines before certain line types, leading to unexpected output.

### Issues:
1. Incorrect handling of line types such as decorators, `def`, and imports.
2. Misinterpretation of depth levels for determining the number of newlines to insert.
3. Not properly considering the previous line's properties for decision-making.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for inserting empty lines based on different line types and their relations to previous lines. Specifically, we need to check for conditions where empty lines should be inserted or skipped depending on the context of the current and previous lines.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 1, 0
```

By updating the logic in the function based on the corrected version above, the issues identified should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle different line types and their relationships for inserting empty lines.
