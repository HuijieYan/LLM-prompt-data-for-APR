The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing incorrect behavior in the test cases. The issue seems to be related to how empty lines are handled based on various conditions in the function. After analyzing the runtime values and expected values in multiple test cases, it appears that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.

The main potential error locations in the function are:
1. Incorrect handling of `before` variable: The `before` variable is being reassigned to a value without proper consideration of its usage and updating later in the function.
2. Inconsistent behavior based on line properties: The function checks for multiple conditions based on line properties but the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert is not consistent.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the current line and previous line properties.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the conditions for inserting empty lines before the current line based on the provided test cases and expectations.
