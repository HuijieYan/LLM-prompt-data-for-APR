## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable. In several cases, the `before` variable is assigned a value based on certain conditions. However, in subsequent conditional blocks, the value of `before` is being overwritten without taking into account the initial value assignments.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable retains its assigned value as per the initial conditions and is not overwritten in subsequent blocks unnecessarily. By maintaining the correct value of `before`, we can ensure that the function behaves as intended for all cases.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By retaining the initial value of `before` in each conditional block and avoiding unnecessary overwriting, the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now behave correctly for all cases and pass the failing tests.
