The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly handling the logic to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before a given line of code. In the failing test, the expected values are defined based on certain conditions and previous line information, which should be satisfied by the fixed function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function does not correctly handle the cases where empty lines should be inserted based on different line types (decorators, flow control statements, imports, yield statements, etc.).
2. The logic inside the function does not consistently consider `max_allowed` when determining the number of empty lines to insert.
3. The handling of `previous_defs` list is not accurate, leading to incorrect behavior in determining the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the conditional statements to properly check and determine the number of empty lines required based on different line types.
2. Ensure that `max_allowed` is considered consistently throughout the function for determining the count of empty lines.
3. Update the logic related to `previous_defs` list to accurately track the depth levels and required empty lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By following the bug explanation and fix strategy, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases by correctly handling the insertion of empty lines based on different conditions and line types.
