The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic concerning the insertion of empty lines before specific types of lines. The issue causes incorrect behavior leading to failing test cases.

The problematic part of the function can be identified where the number of newlines calculated, or decision criteria based on the current and previous lines is incorrect. This impacts the behavior of inserting empty lines based on different conditions like decorators, imports, or flow controls.

To fix the bug, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the conditions and logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth != 0:
            before = 1    

    if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth > 0:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in determining the number of empty lines to insert before different line types, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected output for the failing test cases.
