In the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the issue seems to be with the logic around updating the `before` variable when certain conditions are met. The `before` variable is not being updated correctly, leading to incorrect output and failing tests.

#### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is likely related to how the `before` variable is being updated within the function.
- In some cases, the `before` variable is being set to `1 if depth else 2`, which might not be the intended behavior.
- The `before` variable is not consistently updated based on the conditions within the function, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
- Ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on the conditions in the function.
- Review the code logic to determine the correct value of `before` in each scenario to align with the expected behavior.
- Update the logic to set the `before` variable correctly to fulfill the expected output.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for the `before` variable and ensuring it is correctly set based on the conditions in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values.
