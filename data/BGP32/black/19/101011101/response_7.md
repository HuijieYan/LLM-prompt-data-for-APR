### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before certain types of lines like decorators, definitions, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields. The function should correctly determine whether to insert empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to properly handle the cases where empty lines should or should not be inserted. We need to carefully consider the conditions for inserting empty lines before or after specific types of lines.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not self.is_import(current_line)
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the conditions for when to insert empty lines based on the type of the current line, the depth of the indentation, and the context with the previous line. By properly handling these conditions, the corrected function should provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test cases.
