The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic handling empty lines. Based on the provided information, we can see that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert based on different conditions in the code.

The specific issue seems to be with the calculation of `before` and `newlines` variables based on conditions related to decorators, imports, and yield statements.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle these conditions and calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on the context of the current and previous lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = max(2 - int(current_line.depth > 0), 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- The check for the number of empty lines before the first leaf was fixed.
- The handling of the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yield statements were adjusted for better calculation of empty lines.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
