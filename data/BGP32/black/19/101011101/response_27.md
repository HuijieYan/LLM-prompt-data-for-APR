The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly handling the logic for adding empty lines based on certain conditions. The function is supposed to return the number of empty lines to be added before the current line and after the previous line. It also handles different scenarios such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

The bug occurs in two places:

1. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect. Since `is_import` is a function and not a property of `Line`, this check always results in `False`. This condition should call the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument to correctly determine if the previous line is an import statement.
   
2. In the return statement within that conditional block, `(before or 1)` is incorrect. The intention here is to prioritize using `before` and default to `1` if `before` is falsy. However, the logical OR operator `or` does not work as expected in this context. It returns the first argument if it's a truthy value and the second argument otherwise. To fix this, an `if` statement should be used to handle the logic correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        if before == 0:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return before, 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    return before, 0
```

By fixing these issues, the function should accurately handle the conditions and return the correct number of empty lines before the current line and after the previous line.
