### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly checking whether `self.previous_line` is an import or yield statement. The function is supposed to handle different cases based on the current line's content, but it fails to correctly identify import and yield statements, resulting in incorrect handling of newlines.

1. In case 2, the function incorrectly identifies the previous line as an import statement when it is not, leading to the return of unnecessary empty lines.

2. In case 6, the function mistakenly treats the previous line as an import statement when it is not, causing extra empty lines to be inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies import and yield statements when deciding whether to insert empty lines. We should modify the conditions that check for imports and yields to align with the logic intended for those cases.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making sure that the `is_import` function correctly identifies import statements, we can fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This correction should address the issues seen in the failing test cases by handling the newline insertion logic correctly.
