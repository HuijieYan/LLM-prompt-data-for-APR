Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in certain conditions. The issue arises when determining the number of newlines to insert based on the current line's properties and the previous line's properties. The function should return the correct number of empty lines based on the context of the code.

The bug appears to be in the section where the function checks for decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, and imports. The line that specifically causes an issue is the check related to imports, resulting in incorrect empty line handling.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be added based on the different conditions. We should address the discrepancies in handling the imports and adjust the behavior according to the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not self.previous_line.is_import
        and current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of imports to align with the expected behavior and fixes the bug causing the failing tests. It provides a more accurate determination of the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the specific conditions in the code.
