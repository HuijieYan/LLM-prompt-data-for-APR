Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime and expected values, the bug arises from incorrect handling of newlines before certain types of lines. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for deciding how many empty lines should be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed in order to fix this function:

1. The condition for deciding the number of newlines to insert before a line is incorrect, leading to mismatched output compared to the expected values.

2. The logic for handling different types of lines such as decorators, classes, imports, and flow control statements is flawed and needs to be corrected.

3. The variable `newlines` is calculated incorrectly and needs to be adjusted.

4. The handling of special cases like the first line in the file and decorators needs to be revised for accurate output.

To address these issues and fix the buggy function, the following corrected version is provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified in the buggy function and should now provide the expected output values for the given test cases.
