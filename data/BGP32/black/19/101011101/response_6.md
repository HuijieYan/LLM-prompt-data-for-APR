### Bug Analysis:
The bug lies in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where the logic for handling empty lines is flawed. The function fails to correctly handle situations where empty lines should be inserted based on certain conditions. The issue appears to be related to the incorrect determination of the number of newlines to insert or skip in various scenarios.

#### Observations:
1. The variable `before`, which represents the number of lines before the current line, is sometimes incorrectly set based on certain conditions.
2. The insertion of empty lines is incorrectly handled for decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements.
3. The logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert is convoluted and leads to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revisit the conditions under which empty lines are inserted or skipped in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`. We should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on specific scenarios like decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements. The logic needs to be simplified to make the function more robust and accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.lstrip("\n")
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the specified conditions and scenarios.
