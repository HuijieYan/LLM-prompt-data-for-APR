The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect checks and assignments related to empty lines. The function incorrectly handles the count of empty lines based on the depth of the current line and the presence of certain types of lines. This inconsistency leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines in the generated output, causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted in different scenarios. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    insert_empty_lines = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        insert_empty_lines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return insert_empty_lines, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        insert_empty_lines = before or 1
        return insert_empty_lines, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        insert_empty_lines = before or 1
        return insert_empty_lines, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue with inserting empty lines correctly based on the conditions within the code. It ensures that the appropriate number of empty lines is inserted according to the specific context of each line.
