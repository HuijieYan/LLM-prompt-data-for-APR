## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the conditions related to handling decorators, imports, and yielding statements. The problematic scenarios include generating incorrect numbers of newlines and incorrect handling of empty lines before certain types of statements.

1. The `is_import` function is called incorrectly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function `is_import` should be called as `is_import(current_line)` instead of `current_line.is_import`. This leads to an error since `self.previous_line.is_import` is invalid when `self.previous_line` is None.

2. The handling of empty lines before certain types of statements (decorators, imports, yielding) appears to be incorrect. The logic doesn't consider all relevant cases, leading to unexpected results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the call to the `is_import` function to make a direct call with the `current_line` as a parameter.
2. Revise the logic related to handling empty lines before decorators, imports, and yielding statements to cover all edge cases and provide the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(current_line) and not is_import(self.previous_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import` function is called correctly, and the logic for handling empty lines before decorators, imports, and yielding statements has been updated to address all edge cases.
