### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the presence of decorators, definitions, classes, and imports when determining the number of empty lines to insert. The function should accurately account for these cases to ensure correct formatting.

1. The function should correctly handle the cases when the current line is a decorator or a definition, by appropriately adjusting the number of empty lines to insert.
2. The function should ensure that no additional empty lines are inserted between decorators and before the first line in the file.
3. The function should consider the depth of the current line and whether it is part of a flow control statement when deciding on empty lines.
4. The function should correctly handle cases where the previous line was an import or a yield statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the cases mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now be able to handle the different scenarios and provide the correct number of empty lines to insert. This should resolve the formatting issues seen in the failing test cases.
