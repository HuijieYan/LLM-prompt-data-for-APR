The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from not properly updating the `before` value in certain conditions. The function is supposed to handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted based on specific criteria, but it fails to do so correctly.

The function incorrectly resets the `before` value to a fixed value without considering the actual requirements. This leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines in the output, causing the failing test.

To fix this bug, the `before` value should be updated based on the conditions specified in the function. Specifically, the `before` value should be properly adjusted when deciding whether to insert empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic for updating the `before` value has been adjusted to handle different scenarios properly. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
