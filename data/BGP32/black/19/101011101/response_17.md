The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of empty lines before certain line types. Particularly, the logic in the function fails to account for all possible scenarios, resulting in incorrect insertion or omission of empty lines.

To address this bug, we need to revise the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly handle various scenarios based on the type of the current line and the previous line. We should ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted or omitted based on the context of the code.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if not self.previous_line:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before or 1, 0
```

This corrected version should address the incorrect handling of empty lines in various scenarios and resolve the failing tests. It ensures that the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted or omitted based on the context of the code, as expected.
