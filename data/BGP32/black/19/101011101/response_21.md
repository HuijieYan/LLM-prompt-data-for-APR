The buggy function has a logic issue concerning the handling of empty lines and adjusting the `before` value. Here are the key points identified:

1. In the first if statement, the condition `if current_line.depth == 0` updating `max_allowed` to 2 should be modified to `if current_line.depth >= 0` to ensure correct evaluation.
2. The while loop updating `before` inside should be revised to set `before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1`. This logic is required to maintain the correct number of empty lines to be added.
3. The handling of different cases such as decorators, imports, and yields seems fine based on the provided information.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth >= 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected function should now handle the cases mentioned and provide the expected output values for the failing tests.
