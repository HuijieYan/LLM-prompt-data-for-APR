The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of empty lines in certain conditions, leading to the generation of incorrect output. To fix this bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert should be refined according to the expected behavior of the function.

The incorrect output generated by the function results from inappropriate handling of cases where the previous line is an import statement or a yield statement. The function fails to properly consider these cases, leading to the incorrect insertion of empty lines. To rectify this issue, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle these scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly handles cases involving imports and yields. By updating the conditions for inserting empty lines based on these cases, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing tests.
