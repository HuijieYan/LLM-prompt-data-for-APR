The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` causes the incorrect handling of the number of newlines to be inserted before a specific line. This results in differences in the formatted output compared to the expected output, leading to failing tests.

The bug arises from incorrect conditional branches and the handling of `before` and `max_allowed` variables. The function is expected to determine the number of newlines to insert before a line based on various conditions, but it fails to compute the correct values in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic that computes the number of newlines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the handling of `before` and `max_allowed` aligns with the expected behavior for different types of lines and conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    same_depth_import = (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    )
    if same_depth_import:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    same_depth_yield = (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    )
    if same_depth_yield:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the number of newlines before each line is handled correctly according to the specified conditions, aligning with the expected behavior.
