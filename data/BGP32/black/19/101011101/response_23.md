The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it incorrectly handles the logic for adding empty lines based on specific conditions. The function fails to add empty lines in certain cases where it should and returns incorrect values for the number of empty lines. 

The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles conditions like decorators, class definitions, and imports. There are issues with how these conditions are checked and whether the correct number of empty lines should be inserted.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the correct conditions are checked for adding empty lines before different types of code structures like decorators, class definitions, and imports.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting the number of empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous line.
3. Update how the function handles scenarios where empty lines should be inserted or not inserted.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By checking the correct conditions and adjusting the insertion of empty lines accordingly, the corrected function is expected to address the issues and pass the failing tests.
