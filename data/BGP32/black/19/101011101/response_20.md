### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug seems to occur when handling newlines and prefixes in the `first_leaf` of a `current_line`. The issue might be related to incorrectly updating the `before` variable or handling the conditions for empty lines between different types of lines (decorators, imports, etc.). To fix the bug, we need to carefully adjust the logic for handling newlines, prefixes, and the conditions that determine when to insert empty lines.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Reset before counter for new line handling
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version enhances the logic for handling newlines and prefixes, ensures proper conditions for inserting empty lines between different types of lines, and adjusts the behavior based on different scenarios. This version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
