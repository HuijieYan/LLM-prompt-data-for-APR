### Code Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code based on various conditions. The function checks the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, function definition, class definition, import statement, flow control statement, or yield statement to decide the number of empty lines to insert.

#### Bugs:
1. The function is incorrectly handling the case when the previous line is an import statement (`current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`). The current logic is not checking if the previous line is an import statement correctly, causing unnecessary empty lines to be added.
2. The function is using `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function to check if the line is an import statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Modify the condition that checks for previous line import statements to use the `is_import` function instead of directly accessing the attribute.
2. Ensure that the logic correctly handles the case when there is an import statement to avoid adding unnecessary empty lines.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis and bug fix strategy:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    prev_line_is_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
    if prev_line_is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly handle the cases involving import statements and eliminate the unnecessary empty line insertions.
