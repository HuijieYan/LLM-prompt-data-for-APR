## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. This function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug is causing incorrect values to be returned based on the current line attributes.

## Potential Error Location:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line may not be handling all the conditions correctly.
2. The manipulation of `before` variable and its comparison with `max_allowed` seems to be causing issues.
3. The handling of special cases such as decorators, flow control lines, imports, and yields may not be accurate.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` likely stems from incorrect handling of `before` variable and its comparison with `max_allowed`. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different line attributes (decorators, flow control, imports, etc.) may not be implemented correctly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for updating and comparing the `before` variable with `max_allowed` is correct.
2. Review the conditions for decorators, flow control lines, imports, and yields to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with handling the `before` variable and ensures that the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different line attributes is accurate.
