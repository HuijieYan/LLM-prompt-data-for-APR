## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. Potential error locations:
   - The condition for checking if `current_line.depth == 0` might be causing incorrect values to be assigned to `max_allowed`.
   - The logic for updating the `before` variable inside the while loop.
   - The logic for returning the number of newlines before and after the current line.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the logic for determining the number of newlines and updating variables is correct.
   - Check conditions for different types of lines (e.g., decorators, flow control, imports) to return the correct number of empty lines.
   
## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the current function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The incorrect handling of the `depth` value and the conditions for different types of lines can lead to incorrect results when calculating the number of newlines.

## Fix:
```python
# Fixed version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    before = 0
    for leaf in current_line.leaves:
        before = min(leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the fixed version, I adjusted the logic to correctly calculate the `max_allowed` value, updated the `before` variable handling, and ensured the correct conditions are checked for different line types to return the appropriate number of empty lines.
