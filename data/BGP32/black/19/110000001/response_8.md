Based on the provided buggy function and the buggy class declaration, the potential error locations are:

1. The `current_line` parameter is used to access attributes like `current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, etc. This suggests that the `current_line` object should be an instance of a class that has these attributes defined. However, the class definition for `Line` is not provided in the code snippet, so the bug might be related to incorrect usage of the `current_line` object.

2. The function logic is quite complex and involves conditional branches based on different attributes of `current_line`. There might be issues in handling these conditions properly which could lead to incorrect behavior.

3. The bug appears to be related to how the function determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function should return a tuple of integers `(before, after)` representing the number of empty lines before and after the line. However, based on the code, there seem to be inconsistencies in how these values are calculated and returned.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to:
- Ensure that the `current_line` object passed to the function has all the necessary attributes (depth, leaves, is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, is_yield) defined correctly.
- Review and simplify the logic of the function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined based on the properties of the `current_line`.
- Make sure that the function consistently returns a tuple of integers `(before, after)` as described in its return type annotation.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly calculates and returns the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the attributes of the `current_line` object.
