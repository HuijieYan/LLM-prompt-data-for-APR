The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has some potential error locations that could lead to bugs:
1. The logic inside the `while` loop to update the `before` variable might not behave as intended.
2. The condition to return `0, 0` when `self.previous_line` is `None` may not cover all cases.
3. The condition to return `0, 0` when the previous line is a decorator might not be correctly handled.

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we can follow these strategies:
1. Update the logic inside the `while` loop to correctly update the `before` variable based on the depth of the current line.
2. Add a check to handle cases where `self.previous_line` is `None` before checking for decorators.
3. Modify the condition to return `0, 0` in cases where the previous line is a decorator to cover all scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if current_line.is_import or current_line.is_yield or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles the scenarios mentioned above and should behave as intended within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
