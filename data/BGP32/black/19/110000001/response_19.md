## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function contains conditional statements based on different properties of the `current_line` object.

## Identified Bugs:
1. The logic for updating the `before` variable inside the while loop seems incorrect. It always sets `before` to either 1 or 2, which might not be the intended behavior.
2. In the condition where `is_decorator` is True, the function prematurely returns values without checking other conditions.
3. In the condition where `current_line.is_flow_control` is True, the function returns 1 for the second value, which might not be the intended behavior.

## Cause of Bugs:
1. The bug in updating the `before` variable inside the while loop results in incorrect handling of empty lines.
2. The premature returns based on the `is_decorator` condition result in skipping other checks that may be necessary.
3. The incorrect return value in the `is_flow_control` condition might lead to unexpected formatting issues.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic inside the while loop to only update `before` when necessary.
2. Ensure that all relevant conditions are appropriately checked before returning values.
3. Adjust the return value for the `is_flow_control` condition to provide the correct number of empty lines.

## Corrected Version:
```python

    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
