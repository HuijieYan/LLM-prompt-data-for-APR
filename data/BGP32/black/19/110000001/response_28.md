## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class seems to be responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines that should be inserted before and after the currently processed line. The function takes a `Line` object as input and is expected to return a tuple `(int, int)` representing the number of empty lines before and after the line.

## Identified Issues:
1. The condition `if depth:` after `before = 1 if depth else 2` may not be correctly handling the depth value.
2. The logic for updating the `before` variable within the `while` loop might not be appropriate.
3. Inconsistent checks for `self.previous_line` and `current_line` properties might be causing incorrect line insertions.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function might be caused by incorrect handling of the depth variable and improper updates to the `before` variable within the loop. Additionally, the checks for `self.previous_line` and `current_line` properties may not always produce the desired output, leading to incorrect empty line insertions.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Check and correct the logic related to the `depth` variable to ensure proper handling.
2. Adjust the logic within the `while` loop to update the `before` variable appropriately.
3. Review the conditional statements involving `self.previous_line` and `current_line` to ensure consistent and accurate empty line insertions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
``` 

In this corrected version, I have adjusted the `depth` logic and updated the `before` variable within the loop to ensure consistency. I have also reviewed and revised the conditional statements for `self.previous_line` and `current_line` properties to address the potential bugs. These changes should help in fixing the buggy behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
