## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are multiple issues in the implementation that need to be corrected.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before the current line is incorrect.
2. Incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs` when consuming extra lines.
3. Incorrect condition checking for decorators and flow control statements.
4. Incorrect condition checking for imports and yields.

## Bug Cause:
1. The bug is primarily caused by incorrect handling of previous definitions, decorators, imports, and yield statements within the function. These incorrect conditions lead to erroneous determinations of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the context provided.
2. Ensure that conditions related to decorators, imports, flow control, and yield statements are properly checked to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    before = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max(before, 1), 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining the number of extra empty lines before and after the current line has been adjusted to address the identified issues. Additionally, the conditions for decorators, imports, flow control, and yield statements have been modified to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines.
