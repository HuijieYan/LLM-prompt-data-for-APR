## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. There are several conditional blocks in the function that check various properties of the `current_line` object and adjust the number of empty lines accordingly.
3. The bug in the function may stem from incorrect logic or conditions within the conditional blocks, potentially leading to incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed.
4. One potential strategy for fixing the bug could be to carefully review each conditional block and ensure that the logic aligns with the intended behavior as described in the class documentation.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with the logic of the function and ensures that the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is calculated correctly based on the specified conditions.
