### Analysis:
The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a `_maybe_empty_lines` function that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function determines the appropriate number of empty lines based on various conditions such as line depth, presence of leaves, decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The `max_allowed` variable declaration does not seem to have any impact on the logic of the function.
2. The logic inside the `while` loop with `self.previous_defs.pop()` seems to be resetting the `before` variable inappropriately.
3. The condition for determining the number of newlines for decorators is not correctly implemented.
4. There are inconsistencies in returning values for different conditions.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of variables such as `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines`. Conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields are not properly handled leading to incorrect return values.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Remove unnecessary usage of `max_allowed`.
2. Update the logic inside the `while` loop to handle the `before` variable correctly.
3. Refactor the conditions for decorators and correctly calculate the number of newlines.
4. Ensure consistent return values based on the conditions specified.

### Corrected Function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2 if depth else 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the identified bugs and provides a more accurate calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
