The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The variable `newlines` is assigned a value of 2 but later is decremented by 1. This could result in unexpected behavior.
2. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is a bit convoluted and may contain redundant checks and conditions.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is not implemented correctly. There are redundant conditions and variables that may result in incorrect calculations.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line and ensure that the calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        after = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return before, after
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    return before, after
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures that the number of empty lines before and after the current line is calculated correctly based on the conditions provided.
