## Analysis:
The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function performs various checks based on the current line's properties like depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if current_line.depth == 0` is used to adjust `max_allowed`, but the depth may not always be zero at the start of a new line.
2. The logic inside the `while` loop that pops from `self.previous_defs` may not be functioning correctly.
3. The checks for decorators, `is_def`, and `is_class` may not be consistent with when to insert empty lines.
4. The condition `if current_line.is_flow_control` inserts an extra empty line after the line, which may not be desired in all cases.
5. The logic for handling imports and yields may not be correctly determining the number of empty lines needed.

## Bug Causes:
1. Incorrect handling of the condition `current_line.depth == 0` and assuming it to be the start of the line.
2. Incorrect logic in the `while` loop that removes elements from `self.previous_defs`.
3. Inconsistent handling of decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `if` condition for `current_line.depth == 0` to handle cases where depth may not be zero initially.
2. Revisit the logic inside the `while` loop and ensure it correctly handles the previous definitions.
3. Review the conditions related to decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert.
4. Ensure the function considers all edge cases and correctly calculates the number of empty lines needed in each scenario.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth <= 0:  # Adjust for cases where depth may not be strictly zero
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 0  # Only return the potential empty lines before the line

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- Adjusted the check for `current_line.depth == 0` to handle cases where depth may not be strictly zero.
- Updated the logic inside the `while` loop for removing elements from `self.previous_defs`.
- Revised the conditions related to decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields for correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert.
