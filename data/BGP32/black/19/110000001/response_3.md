## Analysis:
The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a `_maybe_empty_lines` method that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are potential issues with the logic implemented in the method that might lead to incorrect results.

## Issues:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line seems convoluted and might not cover all edge cases.
2. The variable `depth` is being used without being defined within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
3. The condition `depth = current_line.depth` might not be correctly handling the depth comparison.
4. The logic for adjusting `before` when popping elements from `self.previous_defs` might lead to unexpected results.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` contains multiple conditional statements and variable assignments that are complex and might not accurately determine the number of empty lines required before and after the current line. This complexity might lead to incorrect calculations and unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Simplify the logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that all variables used in the method are properly defined and initialized.
3. Review the conditions for adjusting `before` when popping elements from `self.previous_defs`.
4. Refactor the method to improve readability and maintainability.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    after = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    else:
        return before, after
```

In the corrected version, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been simplified and refactored for clarity. The method now directly handles different cases based on the properties of the current line without unnecessary complexity. It ensures that the number of empty lines returned is correctly calculated based on the conditions specified.
