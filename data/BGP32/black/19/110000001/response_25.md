## Analysis:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a `_maybe_empty_lines` function that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function uses various conditions and attributes of the `current_line` object to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted.
- There are multiple `if` conditions that affect the calculation of the number of empty lines.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for `self.previous_line` being `None` might cause unexpected behavior.
2. The condition for not inserting empty lines before the first line in the file might need adjustment.
3. The condition for not inserting empty lines between decorators might need to be reviewed.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` lies in the conditions related to the insertion of empty lines before and after a line. There are scenarios where the expected number of empty lines to be inserted is not correctly calculated. This could lead to incorrect formatting of the code output.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the conditions for calculating the number of empty lines are correctly handled based on the properties and relationships between different lines.
2. Adjust the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after specific types of lines to align with the desired behavior of the function.


## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, adjustments have been made to handle the edge cases and ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions specified in the function.
