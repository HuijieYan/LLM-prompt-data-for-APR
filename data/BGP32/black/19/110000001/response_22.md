The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to add before and after the currently processed line. The issue arises from the incorrect calculation of the `newlines` variable and the usage of `before` variable in the return statements.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the conditions provided in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        if not self.previous_line or not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs = [depth for depth in self.previous_defs if depth < current_line.depth]

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if not self.previous_line:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating `newlines` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the provided code. Additionally, the handling of `self.previous_defs` has been improved for proper clearing of previous depth definitions.
