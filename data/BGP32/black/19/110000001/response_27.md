The potential error locations in the buggy function include:
- Not properly updating the `before` variable based on conditions.
- Incorrect logic for handling the previous definitions.
- Incorrect handling of cases for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug in the function lies in the incorrect handling of the `before` variable and the `self.previous_defs` list. The `before` variable is not being updated correctly based on various conditions, and the logic for popping elements from `self.previous_defs` list is not consistent with the logic. 

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for `before` variable while considering all relevant conditions and adjust the handling of `self.previous_defs`. Additionally, we need to review the conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the update of the `before` variable, adjusted the logic for handling `self.previous_defs`, and refined the conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure correct behavior in determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
