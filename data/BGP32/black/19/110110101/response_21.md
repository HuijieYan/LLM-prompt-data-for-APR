### Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. The variable `max_allowed` is initialized with a default value of `1` but should be `2` when `current_line.depth == 0`.
2. The logic inside the while loop that pops elements from `self.previous_defs` and assigns values to `before` is incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. However, due to incorrect variable initialization and misinterpretation of logic within the while loop, the function is not returning the correct values which lead to failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the initialization of `max_allowed` to `2` when `current_line.depth == 0`.
2. Update the logic inside the while loop to correctly handle the popping of elements from `self.previous_defs` and updating the value of `before`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        popped = self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if popped else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the initialization of `max_allowed` and fixing the logic inside the while loop, the function should now be able to correctly determine the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
