### Analysis
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The function's purpose is to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function seems to be incorrectly handling the logic for determining the number of empty lines.
- There are several conditional statements and calculations that need to be reviewed for potential issues.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test case, the output does not match the expected value.
- The error message indicates that there is an issue with extra newlines and decorators.
- The expected and actual output differ in the number of empty lines before and after the processed line.
- The buggy function seems to be incorrectly handling the logic for decorators and empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Review the logic related to handling decorators and extra newlines.
- Ensure that the calculations for determining the number of empty lines are accurate.
- Update the logic based on the expected behavior described in the test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

### The corrected function addresses the issues related to handling decorators and determining the correct number of empty lines before and after the processed line. The function should now produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
