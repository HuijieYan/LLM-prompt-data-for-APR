### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. Looking at the function, there are multiple branches and conditions that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on various properties of the current line and previous lines.
3. The failing test specifically mentions an assertion error related to the insertion of empty lines before and after certain lines. The error message indicates a discrepancy between expected and actual output.
4. The bug might be related to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after a decorator, def, class, etc.
5. To fix the bug, we need to carefully analyze the conditions for inserting empty lines and ensure that the logic handles all relevant scenarios correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to arise from the mishandling of empty lines before and after decorators. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` does not correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on the presence of decorators or other line types. This leads to incorrect output, causing the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should revise the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately determine the number of empty lines needed before and after each type of line. We need to consider all conditions and properly handle the cases of decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, yields, etc.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
``` 

By revising the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, this corrected version should now handle the calculation of empty lines correctly for different types of lines, including decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields. It aligns with the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
