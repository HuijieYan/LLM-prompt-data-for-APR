### Identification of the Bug
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, based on various conditions.
2. The bug appears to be related to how the `before` variable is being reassigned within the loop, causing incorrect values to be returned.

### Explanation of the Bug
1. When the loop condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth` is satisfied, the code pops elements from `self.previous_defs` and then assigns `before` to either 1 or 2 based on the depth.
2. However, `before` should have been calculated and assigned before the loop starts, rather than updating it within the loop body.
3. This incorrect reassignment of `before` inside the loop causes the subsequent return statement to return incorrect values.

### Fixing the Bug
1. Move the calculation and assignment of `before` outside the loop and update its value based on depth.
2. By ensuring that `before` is calculated correctly before the loop, the function should return the expected values based on different conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    before_updated = before  # Store original before value
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before_updated = 1 if depth else 2  # Update before_updated, not before
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before_updated, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before_updated or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before_updated or 1), 0

    return before_updated, 0
```

By making the above adjustments in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should now correctly calculate and return the expected values based on the provided test cases.
