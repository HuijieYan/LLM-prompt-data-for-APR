### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function tries to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The bug seems to be related to the logic of determining the number of empty lines to be inserted.
4. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual output.
5. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` does not seem to handle certain cases correctly based on the cause of the bug observed from the failing test.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which leads to the calculation of the number of empty lines required before and after a line not being accurate. The return values from the function are not consistent with the expected output for various cases, as evident from the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review the logic of the function and correct the conditions for determining the number of empty lines. We should ensure that the function handles different scenarios correctly to match the expected output in the failing test.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures that the function returns the appropriate number of empty lines based on the conditions provided.

By using this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` and produce the expected results for each case provided.
