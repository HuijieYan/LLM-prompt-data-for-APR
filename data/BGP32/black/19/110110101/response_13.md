### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. The bug seems to be related to the logic of handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` should correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the current line's properties.
2. In the failing test, the assertion is checking the formatted output of the source code. This indicates that the incorrect handling of empty lines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is leading to formatting issues in the output.
3. The function should consider all possible scenarios such as decorators, flow control statements, class definitions, import statements, etc., to determine the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After fixing the function, re-run the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to ensure that the corrected version passes and the expected input/output variable values are satisfied. If the test passes without any assertion errors, the bug has been successfully fixed.
