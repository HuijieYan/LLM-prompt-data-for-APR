### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function uses various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` to calculate the required empty lines.
3. The bug occurs in cases where the expected number of empty lines is not returned correctly, leading to a mismatch in the output of the test function `test_comment_in_decorator`.
4. The bug can be caused by incorrect assignment of values for `max_allowed` and `newlines` variables in the function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the conditions for assigning values to `max_allowed` and `newlines` based on the properties of the `current_line`.
2. Ensure that the correct logic is applied for handling cases such as decorators, imports, yield statements, flow control, etc., to return the expected number of empty lines.
3. Update the function to meet the expected values and types for the provided test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class or current_line.is_decorator:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

After applying the bug fix and updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should now correctly handle the different scenarios based on the properties of the `current_line` and return the expected number of empty lines as per the test cases.
