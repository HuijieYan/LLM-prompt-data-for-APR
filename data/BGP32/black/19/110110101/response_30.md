### Fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function

#### Bug identification:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when trying to handle the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The issue arises due to the incorrect updating of the `before` variable when processing the condition where `self.previous_defs` is not empty. The logic for calculating the number of empty lines seems to be incorrect in this condition.

#### Bug explanation:
When the `self.previous_defs` list is not empty and the depth is greater or equal to the last value in the list, the function incorrectly assigns values to the `before` variable, leading to an incorrect final value. This leads to incorrect behavior when deciding on the number of empty lines to be added before and after the line.

#### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic of updating the `before` variable when `self.previous_defs` is not empty. The correct behavior should be to set `before` to 1 if the depth is truthy (non-zero), and 2 if the depth is zero. This will ensure the correct number of empty lines are added before the line.

#### Corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    before = 1 if depth else 2  # Update before based on depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
