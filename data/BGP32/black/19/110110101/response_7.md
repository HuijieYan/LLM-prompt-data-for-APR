### Bug Analysis
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function tries to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of `before` value updates within the function.
- The function does not update the `before` value correctly in certain conditions leading to wrong results.
- The expected behavior of the function is to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed based on the type of line being processed (decorator, def, class, flow_control, import, yield).
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates a mismatch in the empty lines handling due to incorrect calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. **Update `before` Variable**: Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly throughout the function based on different conditions.
2. **Handle Different Line Types**: Modify the logic to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after based on the type of line being processed.
3. **Check for Previous Line**: Ensure to consider the state of the previous line in determining the number of empty lines needed.

### Corrected Version of `_maybe_empty_lines` Function

```python
# The corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring proper updates to the `before` variable in different conditions and correcting the conditional checks, the corrected version of the function should now handle the determination of empty lines before and after the current line accurately, passing all the expected test cases.
