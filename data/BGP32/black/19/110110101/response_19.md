### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have issues with correctly determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on specific conditions. The function considers various properties of the `current_line` object and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object to make decisions.

#### Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling decorators may not be correctly updating the state of `previous_defs`.
2. Incorrect return values based on certain conditions.
3. The handling of consecutive lines like imports, yields, and flow control may not be consistent.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from incorrect assignment and updating of variables within the function, leading to incorrect decision-making on the required empty lines between lines. This causes the generated output to be different from the expected output.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `max_allowed`, `before`, and other variables are correctly updated based on conditions.
2. Check the conditions for decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to ensure they handle the state transitions correctly.
3. Implement a systematic approach to set the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring the correct handling of variables and conditions within the function, the corrected version aims to generate the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the defined logic.
