## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function has multiple conditional statements to handle different scenarios based on the properties of the `current_line` object.
3. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the case of inserting empty lines before the first line in the file, and between decorators, resulting in incorrect output.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug would involve adjusting the conditional checks to correctly handle the scenarios where empty lines should not be inserted.
   
## Bug Fix
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: [Type[Line]]
    previous_after: int         # Missing required fields
    previous_defs: List[int]    # Missing required fields

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

With the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the scenarios related to inserting empty lines before the first line in the file and between decorators have been appropriately handled. The function should now provide the expected number of empty lines based on the properties of the `current_line`.
