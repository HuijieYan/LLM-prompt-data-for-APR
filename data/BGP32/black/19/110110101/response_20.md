### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The function contains logic to handle different situations based on the properties of the `current_line` being processed.
4. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates a failure in the formatting of comments within decorators.
5. The error message shows a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted output.
6. The expected input/output values for different scenarios are provided.

### Bug
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles comments inside decorators. The logic for inserting empty lines based on various conditions may not be working as expected.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, especially focusing on how it handles decorators and comments. We need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after the decorated content.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = current_line.prefix.count("\n")
    before = min(before, max_allowed)
    current_line.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version aims to address the issues related to comments within decorators and ensures the correct insertion of empty lines based on different conditions.
