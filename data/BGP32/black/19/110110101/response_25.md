### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function has multiple conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines based on various conditions like depth, presence of leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, etc.
3. The bug seems to be related to the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the line, which is causing the test case `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for calculating empty lines based on the different conditions is working correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in the function that determines the correct number of empty lines before and after the lines. This is leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs in the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of empty lines based on the conditions defined in the function.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the corrected logic, the function should now pass the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator`.
