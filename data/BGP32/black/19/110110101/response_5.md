### Bug in the Buggy Function
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function contains a bug where the logic for determining the number of potential extra empty lines is not correctly calculating the values based on the input `current_line` and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object. The bug leads to incorrect computation of `before` and `newlines` values, resulting in mismatched empty lines in the output code.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `before` and `newlines` values in the function. The function is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, due to the incorrect placement and assignment of values to `before` and `newlines`, the function is not computing the correct number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the logic for calculating the `before` and `newlines` values is correctly implemented based on the conditions specified in the function's docstring and requirements. We also need to ensure that the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object is updated appropriately based on the processed `current_line`.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth:
        if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
                self.previous_defs.pop()
                before = 1 if depth else 2
        else:
            before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing the corrected logic for calculating the `before` and `newlines` values based on the provided conditions, the function should now return the correct number of potential extra empty lines before and after the processed line.
