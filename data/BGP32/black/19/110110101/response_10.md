### Analysis
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function contains several conditional checks based on the properties of the `current_line`.
3. The function uses some instance attributes of the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
4. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` compares the expected output with the actual output and fails due to differences in empty lines in the generated code.
5. The main cause of the bug seems to be improper handling of empty lines before and after certain types of lines in the code generation process.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of empty lines before and after decorator lines. The function fails to determine the correct number of empty lines needed in specific scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Enhance the logic to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after certain types of lines such as decorators, flow control, imports, etc.
2. Ensure that the function handles various line scenarios accurately to generate the expected output.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issues related to incorrect empty line handling and generate the expected output for the given test cases.
