### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is meant to return the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The function has several conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines needed. The bug could be related to incorrect logic in these conditions.
4. The failing test is related to a discrepancy in the number of empty lines produced by the function.
5. The function should return a tuple `(newlines, 0)` or `(before, 1)` based on the conditions.
6. The function should handle different cases with different input values for `current_line` and other parameters to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

### Bug:
The bug is likely related to incorrect logic in the conditional statements of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, causing the function to produce an incorrect number of empty lines. This leads to failing test cases where the expected and actual output don't match.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to carefully evaluate each conditional statement and adjust the logic to determine the correct number of empty lines for different scenarios. By properly handling the cases based on the `current_line` properties and other parameters, we can ensure the function returns the expected number of empty lines.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
