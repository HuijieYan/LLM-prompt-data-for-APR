### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to handle the calculation of potential extra empty lines needed before and after each processed line.
2. The function has multiple conditional statements based on the properties of the `current_line` parameter to determine the number of empty lines needed.
3. The function seems to have a bug related to how it handles `self.previous_defs` and setting the `before` variable.
4. The failing test involves comparing the expected and actual formatted output, indicating that the bug in `_maybe_empty_lines` is affecting the formatting of the code.
5. The expected input/output values for the function are well-documented.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `before` variable is being set inside the while loop based on the depth conditions. The issue lies in the line:
```python
before = 1 if depth else 2
```
This code is setting `before` to 1 when `depth` is truthy (non-zero). It should actually be setting `before` to 1 when `depth != 0`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, update the line that sets the `before` variable inside the while loop so that it correctly handles the `depth` condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth != 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
