### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It checks various conditions like decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the number of empty lines.

#### Bugs:
1. The `before` variable is incorrectly updating in the while loop, causing the wrong number of empty lines.
2. The conditions for checking decorators and empty lines before the first line in the file are incorrect.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Fix the logic in the while loop to correctly update the `before` variable.
2. Correct the conditions for checking decorators and the first line in the file to ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth != 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
        
    return before, 0
```

By making the outlined corrections, the function now should correctly handle the various conditions and return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.
