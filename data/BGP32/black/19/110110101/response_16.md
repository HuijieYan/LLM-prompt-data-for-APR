### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and previous lines to decide the number of empty lines.

From the failing test and error message, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in some cases. The assertFormatEqual in the test is failing with a specific input related to comments and decorators.

### Bug Explanation
- The function `_maybe_empty_lines` incorrectly handles the case when there is a comment inside a decorator. It fails to account for extra empty lines required between comments and decorators, resulting in an incorrect number of empty lines being added.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle the case when there is a comment inside a decorator. We should ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Solution
```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    ...

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        # Adjusted condition to handle the case when there is a comment inside a decorator
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 2, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By updating the condition related to decorators and comments, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted when a comment is found inside a decorator. This fix should address the bug and make the function `_maybe_empty_lines` behave as expected across various cases, passing the failing test.
