### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that is designed to handle the logic for determining the number of potential empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of `self.previous_defs` and the logic for determining the number of newlines to return based on certain conditions.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing the expected and actual formatted code and is failing due to a difference in the number of empty lines inserted.
4. The bug appears to be related to the logic for adjusting the `before` and `newlines` values based on different conditions in the function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for handling `self.previous_defs` and the conditions for adjusting the `before` and `newlines` values are correctly implemented.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

Please test the corrected version with the failing test to ensure it now passes.
