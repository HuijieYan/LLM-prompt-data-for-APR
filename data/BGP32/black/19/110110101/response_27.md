### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for returning the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` parameter to determine the number of empty lines needed.
3. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the `before` variable and handling of `self.previous_defs`.
4. The bug causes the function to incorrectly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the `current_line` in certain cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `before` is correctly calculated based on the prefix of the first leaf and the previous definitions are handled properly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the calculation of `before` and handling `self.previous_defs` properly, this corrected version of the function should now return the correct number of empty lines before and after the `current_line` for all the provided test cases.
