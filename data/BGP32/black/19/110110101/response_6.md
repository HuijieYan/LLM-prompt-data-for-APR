### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The main issue in the buggy function seems to be with resetting the `before` variable in a loop condition. The loop condition is intended to cleanup previous definitions based on depth levels, but it unintentionally resets the `before` variable for the current line.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` has an assertion failure during the `assertFormatEqual` call. The output from the buggy function causes an extra newline to be added before the expected output in some specific cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to refactor the loop section that handles the previous definitions to not interfere with the `before` variable for the current line.
  
### Bug Fix
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    prev_defs_to_remove = []
    for prev_def_depth in self.previous_defs:
        if prev_def_depth >= depth:
            prev_defs_to_remove.append(prev_def_depth)

    for prev_def_depth in prev_defs_to_remove:
        self.previous_defs.remove(prev_def_depth)

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By refactoring the loop section that cleans up previous definitions, we prevent unintentional resetting of the `before` variable. The suggested fix should resolve the issue and pass all the expected cases provided.
