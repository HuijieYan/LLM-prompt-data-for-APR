### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks different conditions related to the current line, the previous line, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the number of empty lines needed.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted output, likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line.
5. We need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions met by the current line and the previous lines.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function logic for handling empty lines based on various conditions is not properly implemented, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to carefully adjust the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to ensure that the proper number of empty lines are inserted before and after the current line based on the conditions defined in the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Check for previous definitions popping
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic in the `maybe_empty_lines` function based on the conditions provided and ensuring correct handling of empty lines, the corrected version should now correctly handle the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
