### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is buggy and needs to be fixed.
2. The function takes a `current_line` parameter of type `Line` and calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the calculation of `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions provided.
4. The function checks various conditions related to the type of line (decorator, def, class, import, yield, flow control) and adjusts the empty lines accordingly.
5. The issues seem to arise from the logic of adjusting the `before` and `newlines` variables without considering the earlier state of the line and previous lines properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the situation where `is_decorator` is True and the conditions for adjusting `before` and `newlines` are not properly handled based on the previous line and line types.
- In the current logic, the function checks for the type of the current line but does not consider how the previous line type affects the calculation of empty lines.
- Incorrect handling of the conditions related to `is_decorator` results in wrong adjustments for `before` and `newlines`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly consider the previous line and its type when calculating the number of empty lines needed.
- Make sure to handle the conditions related to `is_decorator` correctly and adjust `before` and `newlines` based on the interaction with the previous line and its type.
- Consider edge cases where specific types of lines (decorators, imports, yields) affect the empty line adjustments.

### Updated Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Ensure to test the corrected function against the failing test cases to validate that the bug has been fixed and the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
