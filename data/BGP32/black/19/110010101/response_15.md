### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which provides stateful methods related to handling extra empty lines.
2. The function is intended to compute the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The cause of the bug might be related to how the `before` variable is being updated inside the function and how the logic handles different scenarios.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable behaves consistently and that the conditions and logic branches cover all possible cases correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug likely arises from the inconsistent updating of the `before` variable within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Depending on the conditions met by each current line, the `before` variable might not retain the correct values leading to incorrect empty line handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Evaluate and adjust how the `before` variable is updated and used throughout the function.
2. Make sure that all relevant cases are covered by the conditions to handle different types of lines appropriately.

### Updated corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed based on the input line and previous line conditions.
