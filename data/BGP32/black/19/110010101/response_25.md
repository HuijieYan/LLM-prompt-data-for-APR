The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in how the `before` variable is handled when updating its value. The function incorrectly assigns a new value to `before` inside the `while` loop, which results in `before` being overwritten on subsequent iterations of the loop.

To fix the bug, we need to introduce a separate variable to keep track of the initial value of `before` before entering the loop. Then, we can update `before` as needed within the loop without losing the original value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        initial_before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        initial_before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return initial_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (initial_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (initial_before or 1), 0

    return initial_before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` value is correctly maintained throughout the function, preventing it from being lost due to reassignment within the loop. It should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output values.
