### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic of determining the number of newlines before and after the current line, particularly when handling decorators and control structures.
3. The current implementation is not accurately handling the cases involving decorators, imports, and flow control structures.
4. We need to revise the logic for determining the number of newlines based on the input parameters and the previous line.
5. Adjust the conditions for handling decorators, imports, and control structures to correctly calculate the required number of blank lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, before

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return before, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, before

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By revising the conditions for handling decorators, control structures, and imports, the corrected version of the function should now accurately determine the number of newlines required before and after the current line in each specific case.
