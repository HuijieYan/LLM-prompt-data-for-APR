### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class that maintains state for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function seems to calculate the number of empty lines based on various conditions such as line depth, leaf information, previous line information, and line type.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates an assertion failure stating the difference between the expected and actual output of the function.
4. The function uses conditions, loops, and state variables to determine the number of empty lines, but there might be a logical error in the calculation which leads to incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation
- The function `_maybe_empty_lines` processes different types of lines based on conditions such as decorators, definitions, flow control, imports, and yields. It utilizes the `current_line` and `self` (EmptyLineTracker) internal state to make decisions.

- The bug might be causing incorrect decisions regarding the insertion of newlines before and after the lines, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

- Insufficient handling of the conditions related to line types, previous lines, and the depth level might be causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the conditions and logic for inserting newlines before and after each line type.
2. Check the handling of each conditional block to ensure the correct number of newlines is being returned.
3. Ensure that the state variables (`max_allowed`, `previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, etc.) are being updated correctly based on the line type and depth.
4. Test the function with different types of lines to verify the correct number of empty lines are being returned.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected function should address the logic issues in the original version and provide the expected output for different test cases. Make sure to validate the function with additional test cases to ensure correctness.
