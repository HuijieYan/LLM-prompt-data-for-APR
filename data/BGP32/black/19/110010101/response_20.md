### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class has issues related to determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function has multiple conditional branches that set the values of `before` and `newlines` based on various conditions related to the type of the current line and the previous line.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed. The failing test asserts that the actual output does not match the expected output, indicating a bug in the function's logic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which `before` and `newlines` are being set and adjust the logic to align with the expected behavior.
5. The expected output should be determined based on the type of the current line and the previous line, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are returned consistently.

### Bug Fix:
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the conditions specified in the cases described. This version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
