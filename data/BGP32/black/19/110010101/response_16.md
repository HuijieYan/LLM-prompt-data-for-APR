### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function aims to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The error message indicates a format mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.
4. The function contains multiple conditional branches based on the attributes of the `current_line`.
5. The error could be due to incorrect calculations or conditions in the function that are not producing the expected output.
   
### Bug Explanation:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after a line.
2. The buggy function might not correctly handle all cases leading to incorrect empty line calculations.
3. The error message suggests that the empty lines before and after the line (expected vs. actual) don't match. This mismatch could be attributed to the incorrect handling of various conditions.
   
### Bug Fix:
1. Ensure that all conditions in the function are correctly evaluated to handle each case properly and return the expected results.
2. Modify the function to consider all possible scenarios and adjust the empty line calculations accordingly.

### Correction:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring all cases are handled correctly based on the given input conditions, the corrected function should now return the expected values and pass the failing test cases.
