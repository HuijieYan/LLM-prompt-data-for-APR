### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a function `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function appears to have a logic issue where it is not accurately handling the cases for detecting empty lines based on the type of the current line.
3. The failing test provided with the assertion error shows that there are discrepancies in the expected vs. actual output, indicating that the function is not producing the correct number of empty lines.
4. The function seems to have an issue with not setting the number of newlines correctly depending on the line type and depth.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Adjust the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the line based on its type.
- Update the conditions inside the function to handle different cases correctly.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the corrected version should now be able to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on its type and other relevant factors.
