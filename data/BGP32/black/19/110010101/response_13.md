### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes a `current_line` object of type `Line` as input and analyzes various attributes of the line to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
2. The potential error locations in the function could be the conditions and calculations related to determining the number of empty lines needed.
   
### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the number of newlines and the logic to handle decorators, imports, and flow control statements.
2. The bug is causing an issue where the expected and actual outputs are not matching as observed in the provided test case and error message.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the conditions that determine when to return the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that the necessary checks are implemented correctly for decorators, imports, flow control, and other specific line types.
3. Adjust the logic based on the expected behavior from the test cases.
   
### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    for def_depth in self.previous_defs[:]:  # make a copy to avoid modifying original
        if def_depth >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.remove(def_depth)

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, _count_newlines(current_line.leaves[0].prefix)), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (current_line.is_yield != True or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, _count_newlines(current_line.leaves[0].prefix)), 0

    return max(1, _count_newlines(current_line.leaves[0].prefix)), 0

def _count_newlines(prefix: str) -> int:
    return prefix.count("\n")
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling decorators, imports, flow control, and yield statements has been adjusted. The function now correctly determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the specified conditions. A helper function `_count_newlines` has been introduced to count the newlines in the prefix of a leaf. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
