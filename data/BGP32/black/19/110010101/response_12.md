### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions based on the properties of the current line and previous lines to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

Based on the error message from the failing test, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in certain cases, leading to assertion errors. The expected input/output values given for different cases provide insights into the expected behavior of the function.

### Bug Identification:
1. The condition `if self.previous_line is None` returns `0, 0` which might be causing the function to not account for empty lines before the first line in the file.
2. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` also returns `0, 0`, which might be incorrect for handling empty lines between decorators.
3. In the case when the function should insert two empty lines, the return value is `(newlines - 1), 0` which might be causing discrepancies in handling specific scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles empty lines before the first line in the file by adjusting the condition `if self.previous_line is None`.
2. Modify the condition for inserting empty lines between decorators to return the correct values.
3. Adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in cases where two empty lines are required.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 1
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making these adjustments, the function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the different conditions described in the expected input/output values.
