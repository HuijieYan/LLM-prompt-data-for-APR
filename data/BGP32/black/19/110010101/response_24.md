### Analysis
The buggy `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class checks various conditions related to the properties of the `current_line` argument and updates some internal state variables like `self.previous_defs`. The function is intended to return a tuple representing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The bug in the current implementation might be related to how the function handles the `previous_defs` list and updates the `before` variable based on certain conditions.

### Bug Explanation
1. In cases where the condition to update `before` is met, the function should not be resetting `before` to `1` or `2`, but instead, it should increment `before`.
2. The logic that updates `before` inside the while loop related to `previous_defs` might be resetting the `before` value inappropriately.
3. Also, the logic under the case of checking imports and yield statements might need to consider the conditions more accurately.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `before` is updated correctly based on the conditions in the function.
2. Review the logic for updating `before` inside the `while` loop to ensure it increments properly.
3. Review and modify the conditions related to the import checks and yield statement checks to return the correct values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before += 1 if depth else 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions and ensures that the `previous_defs` list is managed appropriately during the operations of the function.
