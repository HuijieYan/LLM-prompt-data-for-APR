### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are issues in how the `before` variable is being updated and managed within the function, leading to incorrect results. 

### Bugs in the Function
1. The function incorrectly updates the `before` variable within the loop based on conditions while it should be keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.
2. There is an issue with setting the `before` value in certain conditions, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fixes
1. Store the maximum of the calculated `before` value and the current `max_allowed` value during each iteration of the loop.
2. Correctly set the `before` value based on the conditions within the function.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    max_before = before  # Store the max value encountered so far
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        max_before = max(max_before, 1 if depth else 2)  # Update max_before value
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (max_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (max_before or 1), 0

    return max_before, 0
```

By ensuring that the `before` value is correctly updated and setting the `max_before` variable within the loop, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected results for the given test cases.
