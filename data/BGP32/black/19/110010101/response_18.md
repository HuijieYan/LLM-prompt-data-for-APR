### Problem Identification
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the computation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function is making incorrect decisions based on the conditions provided, leading to incorrect results for the test cases. The logic to handle empty lines, decorators, flow control, imports, and previous line information needs to be fixed.

### Root Cause
The root cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of the conditions to determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The logic does not properly consider the different cases and thus results in discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the conditions for various scenarios like decorators, imports, flow control, and previous line information are correctly handled.
2. Use the information provided in the input parameters to determine the number of empty lines needed.
3. Make sure to update the values of variables like `before`, `max_allowed`, and `newlines` based on the correct conditions.

### Bug-fixed Version

```python
from typing import Tuple

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # Fixed version of the buggy function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        depth = current_line.depth
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        else:
            return before, 0
```

By using the correct conditions and utilizing the input parameters effectively, the fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values in various scenarios.
