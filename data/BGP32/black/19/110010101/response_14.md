### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function uses various conditions and checks related to the current line and the previous line to decide the number of empty lines to insert.
3. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to insert, leading to failing test cases where the expected and actual outputs don't match.
4. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of previous definitions tracked by `self.previous_defs`. The logic for popping previous definitions and setting the `before` value is not adjusting properly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for adjusting the `before` value based on previous definitions and depth level.

### Proposed Fix:
I will modify the logic related to popping previous definitions and adjusting the `before` value based on depth level. Specifically, after popping a previous definition, the `before` value should be set to 2 if the depth is non-zero, otherwise 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
