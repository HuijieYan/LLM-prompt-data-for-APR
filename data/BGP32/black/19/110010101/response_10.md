### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic related to `self.previous_defs`. It seems that the intention is to adjust the number of empty lines based on the depth of the current line and the previous definitions. However, the current implementation of removing elements from `self.previous_defs` and setting `before` based on `depth` is causing incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the while loop with `self.previous_defs`, when popping elements based on `self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth`, if `depth` is `0`, the loop always sets `before` to `2`, which doesn't align with the expected behavior.
2. The setting of `before = 1 if depth else 2` inside the loop can lead to incorrect `before` values when `depth` is `0`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to redesign the logic for adjusting the number of empty lines based on the current line's depth and the previous definitions. We should avoid directly manipulating `before` inside the while loop to ensure correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
``` 

The corrected version addresses the issues with `before` calculation and handling the `self.previous_defs` list to ensure correct counting of empty lines based on the current line's characteristics and previous definitions.
