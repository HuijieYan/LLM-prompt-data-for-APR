### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the nature of the current line (e.g., decorator, def, class) and the previous line to decide on the number of empty lines.

The bug seems to be related to the logic used to determine the number of empty lines in specific cases. The function's incorrect handling of certain conditions is leading to unexpected outputs, as indicated by the failing test case.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test case is related to comments inside decorators. The difference between the expected output and the actual output suggests that the function is not correctly handling the case of comments inside decorators. The incorrect handling of decorators and the number of newlines is most likely causing the discrepancy.

### Bug Location
The bug may be located in the logic that calculates the number of newlines to be inserted before and after a line, specifically in the part that deals with decorators and comments within decorators.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for handling decorators and comments inside decorators needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the condition that checks for decorators, the insertion of newlines before/after decorators, and the presence of comments within decorators should be reviewed and corrected.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

Make sure to test this corrected version against all the expected test cases to ensure that it behaves as expected and passes all the conditions.
