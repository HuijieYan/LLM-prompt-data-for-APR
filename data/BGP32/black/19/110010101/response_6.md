### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statements setting the `max_allowed` variable may not be working as intended.
2. The loop that checks `self.previous_defs` and updates the `before` variable might not be correctly handling depth values.
3. The conditions for returning newlines might not cover all required scenarios.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be causing incorrect handling of empty lines before and after lines in the code. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of empty lines needed based on the current line being processed. However, due to conditional errors and incorrect handling of depth values, the function is returning incorrect values for empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `max_allowed` variable is correctly set based on the depth of the current line.
2. Verify that the loop checking `self.previous_defs` is correctly updating the `before` variable based on depth values.
3. Review the conditions in the function for returning newlines and ensure that all scenarios are covered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, kind, value):
        self.kind = kind
        self.value = value

@dataclass
class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line=None, previous_after=0, previous_defs=None):
        if previous_defs is None:
            previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.value.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.value = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.leaves[0].kind == '@'
        if is_decorator or current_line.leaves[0].value == 'def' or current_line.leaves[0].value == 'class':
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.leaves[0].kind == '@':
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2 - (1 if current_line.depth else 0)
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.leaves[0].value in ['if', 'while', 'for', 'try', 'except', 'with']:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.leaves[0].value == 'import'
            and current_line.leaves[0].value != 'import'
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.leaves[0].value == 'yield'
            and (current_line.leaves[0].value != 'yield' or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function modifies the logic to ensure that `max_allowed` is correctly set based on the depth of the current line, and the `before` variable is updated accordingly. Additionally, the conditions for returning newlines have been adjusted to cover all the required scenarios.
