### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is defined inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class in the `black.py` file.
2. The function contains multiple condition checks based on the properties of `current_line` and previous lines that impact the calculation of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error message indicates a failure in the output format comparison between the expected format and the actual format after processing a source code snippet.
4. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of empty lines in specific scenarios within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug seems to be associated with the calculation of empty lines before and after the current line, especially in cases involving decorators, imports, and yields.
2. The function incorrectly handles scenarios related to imports and decorators, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.
3. The error message provides a comparison between the expected and actual formatted source code, highlighting the discrepancies in the handling of empty lines in certain situations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles scenarios involving decorators, imports, and yields to insert empty lines as needed.
2. Adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to align with the expected behavior based on the provided test case and error message.
3. Update the condition checks and calculations for empty lines to resolve the discrepancies observed in the comparison of formatted source code.

### Corrected Version:
```python

from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

# The function from the same file, but not the same class, called by the buggy function

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if not depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the issues related to empty line calculations based on different line properties and should pass the failing test.
