### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison involving `current_line.is_import` which is a function call, not a property reference.
3. The error message indicates that the empty lines before and after a line are not being handled correctly in certain cases, leading to incorrect formatting.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct conditions are being checked for when determining the number of empty lines before and after a line.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`, where `is_import` is a function and not a property of `previous_line`. This function call is not what the code intends to check. Therefore, the condition is never being met as intended.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `is_import` function to set a flag within `previous_line` to indicate whether it is an import line or not.
2. Modify the condition in `_maybe_empty_lines` to check this flag in `previous_line` instead of calling the `is_import` function directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Updated function to set 'is_import' flag in the leaf
    # Implementation of is_import function
    return leaf.is_import


@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
``` 

By making these changes, we ensure that the correct condition is being checked when determining the number of empty lines before and after each line, fixing the bug.
