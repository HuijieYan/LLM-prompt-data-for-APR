#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method within the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test.
3. The error message points out a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the test. It seems like the function is not handling empty lines correctly, resulting in the assertion failure.
4. The bug might be related to how the function handles empty lines before or after certain types of lines, like decorators or imports.
   
#### Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of empty lines before or after certain types of lines like decorators or imports in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to review and correct the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after different types of lines.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if previous line is an import
            and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if current line is not an import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version, I added a function call `is_import()` to correctly check whether a line is an import. This should fix the bug related to incorrect handling of empty lines before or after import statements. 

This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
