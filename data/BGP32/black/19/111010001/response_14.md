## Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class defines a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The buggy function compares `self.previous_line` with `current_line` to determine the required newline behavior. There is a specific condition that checks whether the previous line is an import or yield, but it incorrectly accesses `is_import` and `is_yield` as attributes of the Line objects, instead of calling the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions.
3. The error message indicates a failing test due to an incorrect number of empty lines being expected compared to the actual output.
4. To fix the bug, the conditions for checking import and yield statements should be corrected to use the function calls instead of attribute checks.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition where `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` are checked. Instead of directly accessing the attributes, call the functions `is_import` and `is_yield` to correctly determine if the previous line was an import or yield statement.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1 if before else 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_yield(self.previous_line) and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1 if before else 1, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the changes as suggested in the corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed and the function should now correctly handle the conditions related to import and yield statements. This should result in passing the failing test provided.
