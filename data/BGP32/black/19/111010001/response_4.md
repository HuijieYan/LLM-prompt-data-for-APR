## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is used to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after a currently processed line.
2. The function has several conditional checks based on properties of the `current_line` object and the previous lines. It adjusts the number of empty lines accordingly.
3. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the function, specifically related to the number of empty lines present or inserted before and after lines.
4. The bug seems to be related to the logic for determining when to insert empty lines based on the type of line (e.g., import, yield, or flow control) and the relationship with the previous line.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to be related to the conditions for inserting empty lines before or after certain types of lines, such as imports, yields, and flow control. The function checks if the previous line is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`, but there is no direct method `is_import` defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. Instead, the `is_import` function is defined outside the class. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access `is_import` as an attribute of the `previous_line`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for imports to use the `is_import` function from the same file rather than trying to access it as an attribute of the `previous_line` object. We can pass the necessary information to the `is_import` function to determine if the line is an import.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_import(self.previous_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with a function call `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import. This ensures that the function operates as intended and the bug causing the AttributeError is resolved.
