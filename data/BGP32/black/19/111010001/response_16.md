## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is checking for various conditions related to empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
3. The bug seems to be related to the condition where `current_line.is_import` is being checked. The `is_import` function is a global function, but it is expected to be accessed as `is_import(leaf)` instead of trying to access it as an attribute of `current_line`.
4. The bug can be fixed by calling `is_import` function with the leaf from `current_line` instead of trying to access it as an attribute.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition where `current_line.is_import` is being checked.
2. Instead of accessing it as an attribute, call the `is_import` function passing the leaf from `current_line`.
3. This will properly determine if the current line is an import.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.

            self.previous_line

        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

By making the change to properly call the `is_import` function with the leaf from `current_line`, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
