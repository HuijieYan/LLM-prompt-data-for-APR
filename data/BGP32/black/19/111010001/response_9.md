### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a `_maybe_empty_lines` method that is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The bug occurs when checking if the previous line is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`. The intention is to call the `is_import` function from the imported module, but the correct way to do it is by calling `is_import(self.previous_line)`.
3. The error message shows a comparison mismatch between the expected and actual outputs, which indicates that the bug in calculating empty lines is causing a misformatted output in the tested scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly check if the previous line is an import by calling the `is_import` function on the `self.previous_line`.
5. Update the `_maybe_empty_lines` method to correctly determine the number of empty lines required before and after the current line.

### Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the adjustment to call the `is_import` function correctly on the `self.previous_line`, the bug in determining the number of empty lines should be resolved. This fix aims to ensure that the logic correctly identifies import lines in the code and adjusts the formatting of empty lines accordingly.
