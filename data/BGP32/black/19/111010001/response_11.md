### Analysis:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` which is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The bug in the function seems to be related to how it handles cases where the current line is an import and the previous line is also an import.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the actual output has some extra newlines in certain places, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Identifying the Bug:
- The bug seems to be in the block of code that handles scenarios where both the previous line and the current line are imports.
- In the buggy function, `self.previous_line.is_import` is used to check if the previous line is an import. However, `is_import` is actually a function (`is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`) and not a property of `previous_line`.
- This leads to incorrect handling of import statements and extra newlines being added or removed incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to modify the code block that checks if both the current line and the previous line are imports.
- Instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should use `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import.
- This will ensure that the function handles import statements correctly and eliminates the issue of extra newlines in the output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if previous line is an import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the case where both the previous line and the current line are imports, eliminating the issue of extra newlines and ensuring the output matches the expected result.
