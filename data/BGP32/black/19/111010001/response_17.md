## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. The function is trying to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates an issue with the format of the output, specifically related to the handling of empty lines and comments within decorators.
4. The error suggests that the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before or after specific types of lines like imports, yields, etc.
5. The function is using properties like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to determine the type of the current line.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of conditions related to empty lines before and after specific types of lines. The conditions related to imports, yields, and decorators are not properly considered, leading to incorrect insertion or omission of empty lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the conditions related to imports, yields, and decorators are correctly evaluated to determine the number of empty lines needed before or after the current line.
2. Update the logic to handle the insertion of empty lines consistently based on the type of the current line.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
            and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if the current line is not an import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0

```

In the corrected version, the bug related to handling imports, yields, and decorators has been addressed by checking the type of the current line using the `is_import` function. This ensures that empty lines are inserted correctly based on the conditions specified.
