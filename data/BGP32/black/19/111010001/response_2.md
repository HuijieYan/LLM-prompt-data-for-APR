1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions based on the current line's properties and the properties of the previous line.

2. An error could potentially occur in the logic where the function decides whether to insert empty lines before or after the current line. Specifically, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is used without considering that `is_import` is a function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` and not a property of the `previous_line`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` incorrectly accesses `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming it is a property of the `previous_line` object within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. However, `is_import` is a separate function and not a property of the `previous_line`.

4. To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should only use properties and methods that are directly accessible from the `current_line`, `previous_line`, or other attributes of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. In this case, we should not directly access `is_import` when checking conditions related to `previous_line`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check whether the previous line is an import statement. This modification ensures that the function correctly identifies whether to insert empty lines based on the import status of the current and previous lines.
