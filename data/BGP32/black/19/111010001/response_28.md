### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` in the `assertFormatEqual` method which compares the expected and actual formatted output.
4. The issue seems to be related to the generation of empty lines before and after certain types of lines such as decorators, imports, and yield statements.
5. The buggy function is incorrectly handling the cases for decorators, imports, and yield statements, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Cause:
The error is likely caused by incorrect logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function when handling cases for decorators, imports, and yield statements. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines are not correctly implemented, leading to the incorrect formatting of these statements compared to the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the logic for handling decorators, imports, and yield statements in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified for each type of statement.
3. Update the logic to match the expected formatting output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)  # Fix: Call is_import function with current_line
        and not current_line.is_import(current_line)  # Fix: Call is_import function with current_line
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the conditions for decorators, imports, and yield statements have been fixed to return the correct number of empty lines based on the logic provided. Additionally, the `is_import` function is properly called with the `current_line` argument to check if the current line is an import statement.
