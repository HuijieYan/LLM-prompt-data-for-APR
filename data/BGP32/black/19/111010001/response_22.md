### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The method uses various conditions and checks related to the current line, previous line, depth, decorators, imports, yield statements, etc., to calculate the required number of empty lines.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates a failed assertion when comparing the expected output with the actual output. The discrepancy seems to be related to the presence of empty lines in the output.
4. One possible source of error could be the logic used to calculate and handle empty lines in different scenarios within the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to how the `_maybe_empty_lines` method handles empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The discrepancy in the number of empty lines between the expected and actual output suggests that the logic for determining empty lines is incorrect for certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the logic for handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line in the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
2. Ensure that the conditions related to decorators, imports, yield statements, depth, etc., are correctly handled to determine the correct number of empty lines.
3. Pay close attention to scenarios where the method decides whether to insert empty lines or not based on the previous line and the characteristics of the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version:
- I have updated the logic for handling empty lines considering various conditions and scenarios.
- Made adjustments to correctly calculate the required number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on different checks.
- Ensured that the return values align with the expected behavior as suggested by the logic for empty lines insertion in different situations.
