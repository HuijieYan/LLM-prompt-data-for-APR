1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The condition `if current_line.is_import` is checking for whether the `current_line` object has an `is_import` attribute, which should be a method. However, the proper way to check this is to call the `is_import` method from the global scope by providing the `current_line` object as an argument.
   - The condition for handling decorators might not be properly updating the state variables `previous_defs` and `previous_line`.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the improper check for `is_import` attribute and the incorrect handling of the decorator condition. The error message shows a difference in the number of newlines in the expected output and the actual output, which is likely due to incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Update the condition that checks for `current_line.is_import` to properly call the `is_import` method with the `current_line` object as an argument.
   - Review the logic for handling decorators to ensure that the `previous_defs` and `previous_line` state variables are updated correctly.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
        
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_import` method is called from the global scope to properly check if `previous_line` is an import statement.
- The logic for handling decorators has been kept the same but make sure to review the `is_decorator` condition to ensure correctness.
