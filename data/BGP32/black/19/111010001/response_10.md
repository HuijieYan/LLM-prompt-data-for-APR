## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function relies on properties of the `current_line` object.
3. The error occurs in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator` where the expected and actual outputs do not match. The error message shows that there is a difference in the number of empty lines inserted between comments and decorators in the formatted code.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to insert between certain types of lines. Specifically, the issue arises in the conditions for adding empty lines before and after a line. The function is not correctly handling the cases where there is a difference in depth or type of the current and previous line.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the type and depth of the current and previous lines. By correctly identifying the conditions that require empty lines and adjusting the calculations accordingly, we can ensure that the output matches the expected formatting.

## Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    # Handling logic for adding empty lines based on line types and depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        # Calculate the number of newlines to add
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Handle different line types and depths
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)   # Call the is_import function with the current_line
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- We ensure that the condition for checking if the previous line is an import uses the `is_import` function properly.
- Adjusted the logic for adding empty lines before and after specific types of lines based on their depth and type.
- Fixed the potential issues causing unexpected output for the test case.
