### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class within the `black.py` file.
2. The error message indicates an assertion failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method, which is likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after certain types of lines like decorators, imports, and flow control statements.
3. The bug may be related to how the function handles the presence of empty lines before and after certain types of lines, which might be causing unexpected differences in the formatting output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review and adjust the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure the correct number of empty lines are added according to the specified conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check and adjust how the function calculates and returns the number of empty lines before and after each line according to the given conditions.
2. Make sure that the presence of decorators, imports, flow control statements, etc., is correctly handled to determine the appropriate number of empty lines.
3. Address any inconsistencies in handling empty lines that might be causing the formatting differences observed in the test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import() and not current_line.is_import() and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield() and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the logic for handling empty lines based on the conditions specified in the function. Make sure to integrate this corrected version into your code to pass the failing test.
