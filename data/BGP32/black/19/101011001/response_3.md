### Bug Analysis
1. The `is_import` function is called inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function but is not explicitly imported in the buggy file.
2. The bug occurs when trying to access the property `is_import` on `self.previous_line`, which leads to a AttributeError as the Line object does not have an `is_import` attribute.

### Bug Explanation
1. In cases where `self.previous_line` is accessed and checked for `is_import`, an AttributeError is raised because the Line class (to which `self.previous_line` belongs) does not have a property named `is_import`.
2. This error arises because the code is assuming that `self.previous_line` will have an `is_import` property, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition involving `is_import` to handle cases where `self.previous_line` does not have this attribute. We can achieve this by modifying the condition to check if `self.previous_line` is not None before checking for `is_import`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the `if` conditions to check for the presence of `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes, we can handle the workaround for the missing properties in the Line class.
