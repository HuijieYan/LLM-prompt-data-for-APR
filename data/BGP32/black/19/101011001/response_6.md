### Analysis
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions.
- The function evaluates various conditions related to the current line's properties like depth, type, and whether it is a decorator, def, class, import, flow control, or yield.
- There are inconsistencies in handling the `max_allowed` variable and determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions.
- The test failure indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output, which suggests that the function is not correctly handling the logic for inserting empty lines.
- The runtime values provided for different cases indicate the problematic behavior of the function in determining the correct number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Cause
- The bug seems to stem from incorrect handling of the `max_allowed` variable and the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert.
- The function does not consistently apply the correct logic for different scenarios, leading to incorrect decisions.
- In particular, the handling of `max_allowed` based on the depth of the current line seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Revise the logic related to the `max_allowed` variable to ensure that it is set correctly and used consistently throughout the function.
- Verify the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the current line's properties and adjust the logic to make the correct decisions.
- Review the cases where the function returns the number of empty lines to insert and ensure that they align with the expected behavior for each scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing the corrections above, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should now handle the logic of inserting empty lines correctly based on different conditions, resolving the bug indicated by the failing test cases.
