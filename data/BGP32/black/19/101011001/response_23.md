### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of empty lines in specific cases. In the provided code, the function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. However, in some scenarios, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines is flawed, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Identification
1. In the first condition where it checks for decorators or "def" / "class" keywords, there is inconsistent handling of empty lines. This can cause incorrect spacing before these elements.
2. The condition to skip adding empty lines before the first line in the file is insufficient.
3. The logic for handling empty lines between decorators has a bug.
4. The condition to check for imports is incorrect as it tries to check if `self.previous_line.is_import`, but `is_import` is a function and not an attribute.
5. Incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs` list, leading to wrong results in determining the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure consistency in handling the number of empty lines for decorators and "def" / "class" keywords.
2. Improve the condition to skip adding empty lines before the first line in the file.
3. Correctly handle empty lines between decorators.
4. Update the condition to check for imports by calling the `is_import` function on `self.previous_line`.
5. Properly manage the `self.previous_defs` list to accurately determine the number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
