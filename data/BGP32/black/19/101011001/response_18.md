The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect handling of conditions that check whether the current line is an import or yield statement. The `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` conditions are causing the function to return unexpected results.

The issue arises because the function is trying to access the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes directly on the `self.previous_line` object, which is an instance of the `Line` class that doesn't have these attributes defined. Instead, it should be checking if the `self.previous_line` is an import or yield statement by calling the `is_import` function defined in the same file.  

To fix the bug, you need to modify the conditions that check for import and yield statements. You should replace:
- `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)`
- `self.previous_line.is_yield` with `not is_import(current_line) and is_import(self.previous_line)`

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_import(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function should now handle import and yield statements correctly and pass the failing test cases.
