### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. The bug arises from the comparison between the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` attributes. The function incorrectly checks if the previous line `self.previous_line` is an import using the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, the function does not have access to the `is_import` method directly. It should call the `is_import` function defined in the same file to check if a line is an import.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, replace the incorrect `self.previous_line.is_import` check with a call to the `is_import` function defined in the same file. This adjustment will ensure that the correct condition is checked when considering whether the previous line was an import.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line) # Call is_import function to check for imports
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected function properly checks if the previous line was an import by calling the `is_import` function, resolving the bug.
