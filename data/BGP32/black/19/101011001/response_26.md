### Potential Error Locations
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` based on `current_line.depth`.
2. Modification of `first_leaf.prefix` without considering the case where `current_line.leaves` is empty.
3. Incorrect logic in the while loop that updates `before` based on `self.previous_defs` and `depth`.
4. Incorrect condition to append `depth` to `self.previous_defs` for decorators, defs, and classes.
5. Missing return statements for certain conditions causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is causing incorrect behavior when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line. The function incorrectly handles the logic for different types of lines such as decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields. This leads to the incorrect insertion of empty lines, resulting in a failing test case.

The main issues are related to how `max_allowed` is updated, handling of `first_leaf` when `current_line.leaves` is empty, incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs`, and missing return statements for certain conditions leading to unexpected behavior and failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic to handle `max_allowed` consistently based on `current_line.depth`.
2. Check if `current_line.leaves` is empty before accessing `first_leaf` to avoid errors.
3. Correctly update `self.previous_defs` when encountering decorators, defs, or classes.
4. Ensure all conditions have appropriate return statements to handle different types of lines correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing these corrections, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before a given line, resolving the failing test case and improving the overall functionality.
