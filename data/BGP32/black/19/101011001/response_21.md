### Bug Analysis
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the handling of empty lines. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code, based on certain conditions. The function checks various properties of the current line and the previous line to make the decision.

After analyzing the runtime input/output values, it appears that the function may not be correctly handling the cases where it needs to insert empty lines before specific lines like decorators, imports, or flow control statements. The conditions for inserting empty lines are not being met properly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 2, for a line with a comment ('# TODO: X'), the expected behavior should insert empty lines before the line since it's a decorator. However, the function returns 0, 0, indicating no empty lines should be inserted.
2. In Case 5, for a line with a comment ('# TODO: Z'), the expected behavior should insert empty lines before the line since it's not an import or a decorator. However, the function returns newlines as 2, indicating two empty lines should be inserted, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revise the logic for determining when to insert empty lines correctly. Specifically, pay attention to the conditions related to decorators, imports, and flow control to ensure the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted based on the context.

### Corrected Version
Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0 and not current_line.is_decorator:
        max_allowed = 1
    else:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.is_import or current_line.is_yield:
        if not self.previous_line or not self.previous_line.is_import:
            return before, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditional checks and return statements, this corrected version should address the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test cases.
