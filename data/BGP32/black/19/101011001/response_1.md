### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert between lines of code based on certain conditions. The function interacts with the `Line` class and the `is_import` function to make decisions on the presence of empty lines. The main issues seem to be related to the handling of the `current_line` and `previous_line` attributes which are used to make comparisons and determine the number of empty lines.

### Issues
1. The `is_import` function is not directly called with the correct arguments. Instead of calling `is_import(current_line)`, the buggy version is incorrectly checking `current_line.is_import`, which always returns `False`.

2. The handling of the conditions and checks in determining the number of empty lines seems to be convoluted and might lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the comparison with `is_import(current_line)` instead of `current_line.is_import` to properly check if the current line is an import.
   
2. Simplify the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different conditions.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_current_line_import = is_import(current_line)

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_current_line_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function should properly handle the conditions and correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert between lines of code.
