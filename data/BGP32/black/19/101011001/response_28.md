### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have an issue with handling the logic related to empty lines in the code. The function determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on various conditions such as depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

However, the bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the insertion of empty lines in specific scenarios, leading to incorrect formatting and failing the tests.

1. The function determines the number of empty lines before the current line but fails to accurately handle the cases where decorators are present or between imports, resulting in incorrect formatting.
2. The function's logic related to the insertion of empty lines based on the current line's attributes like `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` seems to be flawed, leading to empty lines being incorrectly inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully review the conditions under which empty lines should be inserted and ensure that the logic accurately handles cases involving decorators, imports, and yields. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic to correctly determine the number of empty lines based on the specific scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the bug analysis, we can provide a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if not self.previous_defs:
        before = max(0, before - 1)
    else:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            before = max(0, before - 1)
            self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for inserting empty lines based on the specific conditions defined in the function, ensuring that the formatting is correctly handled in various scenarios.
