### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to determine the number of empty lines needed before a given line of code based on various conditions. The function checks for different scenarios such as decorators, imports, flow control statements, and previous line types to decide the number of empty lines. However, there seems to be a bug related to the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes, which may not be functioning correctly based on the provided source code and runtime values.

### Bug Explanation
The issue arises when checking for `self.previous_line.is_import` in the if condition. The function uses `self.previous_line.is_import` to determine if the previous line is an import line. However, the `is_import` method is defined in a separate function `is_import`, not as an attribute of `current_line` or `self.previous_line`. As a result, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` always evaluates to `False`, leading to incorrect behavior regarding imports.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to properly call the `is_import` method to check if the current line and the previous line are import lines. We should replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly identify import lines.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle import lines and yield statements, resolving the bug issue identified.
