### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect handling of empty lines based on specific conditions related to decorators, imports, yields, etc. It fails to account for some scenarios where empty lines should be inserted or not inserted based on the previous line's characteristics.

### Bug Location
The bug stems from the logic related to determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. Specifically, the conditions checking for decorators, imports, and yields, as well as the adjustment of `before` and `newlines`, are not handling all scenarios correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure correct handling of decorators based on the previous line.
2. Correctly account for imports and yielding functions.
3. Adjust the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to insert based on line types and previous line characteristics.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Correction Rationale
- Updated the logic for handling decorators to correctly determine the number of newlines.
- Adjusted the conditions for handling imports and yielding functions to insert empty lines where necessary.
- Fixed the calculation of `newlines` based on depth to ensure the correct number of newlines are inserted.

By applying these corrections, the function should now handle the insertion or omission of empty lines based on the characteristics of the current and previous lines accurately.
