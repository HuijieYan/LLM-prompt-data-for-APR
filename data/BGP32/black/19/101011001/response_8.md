### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to how the function handles empty lines before specific types of lines (decorators, defs, classes, flow control, etc.). The function determines the number of newlines to insert before the current line based on various conditions and flags.

1. The function correctly sets `max_allowed` based on the depth of the current line (Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, Case 4, Case 5, Case 6, Case 7, Case 8).
2. The function handles consuming extra newlines from the first leaf correctly (Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, Case 4, Case 5, Case 6, Case 7).
3. The function doesn't insert empty lines before the first line and between decorators correctly (Case 2, Case 3, Case 6).
4. The function correctly sets the number of newlines based on depth for specific line types (Case 3, Case 6).
5. The function compares the current and previous lines for imports and yields correctly (Case 4, Case 5, Case 6).

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the function incorrectly handling the logic for inserting empty lines for specific line types and the condition checks involving the `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` flags. The cases where the tests fail are related to the incorrect handling of empty lines before decorators and the number of newlines based on the depth of the line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and address the failing tests, the following actions need to be taken:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles the insertion of empty lines before the current line based on the line type and depth.
2. Fix the conditions for inserting empty lines before decorators, defs, and other specific line types.
3. Correctly compare the current and previous lines for imports and yields.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

After applying the corrections to the function and updating the logic, it should now pass the failing tests and handle empty lines insertion correctly based on different conditions and line types.
