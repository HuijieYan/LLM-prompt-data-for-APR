### Issue in the Buggy Code
The buggy code has an issue when determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions like whether the line is a decorator, class, def, flow control, import, or yield statement.

One key issue is that the function incorrectly assumes that `self.previous_line.is_import` correctly identifies if the previous line is an import statement. The `is_import` function is never called within `_maybe_empty_lines`, causing incorrect behavior based on the assumption that the `is_import` attribute of `previous_line` accurately reflects import statements.

Additionally, the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on different scenarios seems to be convoluted and suboptimal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the logic to correctly identify import statements by using the `is_import` function.
2. Simplify the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on various conditions for better clarity and correctness.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the `is_import` function's correct evaluation and simplifying the logic for determining newlines to insert, the corrected version should address the issues faced in the failing tests.
