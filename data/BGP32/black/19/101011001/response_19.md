The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to incorrectly handling the conditions for inserting empty lines in the code formatting process. The failing tests indicate issues with the handling of empty lines before decorators, between decorators, and based on specific line types like imports, yields, and flow control statements.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function incorrectly sets the `max_allowed` value based on the depth of the `current_line` but does not consistently apply it throughout the function.
2. The handling of empty lines before decorators and between decorators is flawed, causing discrepancies in the expected and actual formatted code.
3. Incorrect comparisons and conditions related to `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_flow_control` lead to incorrect decisions on inserting empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `max_allowed` value is correctly applied in all relevant conditions.
2. Adjust the logic for handling decorators to prevent unnecessary empty lines.
3. Fix comparisons and conditions related to line types like imports, yields, and flow control statements to insert empty lines appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        depth_newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return depth_newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying the corrected logic in the function, the issues with incorrect empty line placements based on decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements should be resolved. Test the corrected function to ensure that the failing tests pass successfully.
