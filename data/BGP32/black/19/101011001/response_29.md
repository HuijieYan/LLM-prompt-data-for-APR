### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current line and the previous line. The bug seems to be related to the logic checking whether the previous line is an import statement, which is not correctly identified due to an inconsistency in calling the `is_import()` function.

### Bug
The bug lies in the comparison of the `self.previous_line.is_import` condition. The function `is_import()` is being called correctly, but the return value is not being stored or utilized to determine if the previous line is an import statement.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly assign the result of the `is_import()` function call to a variable and use that variable properly in the logic flow of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_previous_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected line
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_previous_line_import  # Corrected line
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By correcting the way the `is_import()` function result is used within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the defined conditions.
