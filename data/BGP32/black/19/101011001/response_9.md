### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that should be added before a given line of code based on certain conditions. The function takes in the current line and some internal state variables.

There are several issues identified in the function that lead to failing tests:
1. The function does not consider the case where `current_line` is an import statement (`current_line.is_import`). However, it checks for `self.previous_line.is_import` in the logic, leading to incorrect results.
2. The function does not handle the scenario where the previous line is an import (`self.previous_line.is_import`) but the current line is not, causing incorrect decisions related to inserting empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the issues identified above:
1. Update the condition that checks if the previous line is an import to check for `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`.
2. Include a check in the logic where if the previous line is an import and the current line is not, then insert empty lines accordingly.

### Updated Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    # Check for import statement condition
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the line contexts, addressing the issues that caused the failing tests.
