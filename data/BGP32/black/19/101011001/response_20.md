### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to handle the number of empty lines to be inserted in a Python code file based on the current line's characteristics and the previous line's context. However, there are issues with the logic that lead to failing tests. The main concern arises from when determining the number of empty lines to be inserted in specific cases, such as before decorators or flow control statements.

1. The function checks if the current line is a decorator, def, or class, but the conditions inside these checks don't seem to handle all cases correctly. In particular, the return values for newlines appear to be incorrect in some scenarios.
2. The function doesn't account for the case when the previous line is an import or yield statement, which should influence the number of empty lines before the current line.
3. The logic related to maintaining and updating `previous_defs` seems to be flawed, possibly leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the issues mentioned in the bug analysis. Here's a strategy to correct the problems:
1. Review the conditions related to decorators, def, and class statements to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned.
2. Include checks for previous lines being an import or yield statement to handle the number of empty lines correctly.
3. Revisit the logic of updating `previous_defs` to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
Based on the bug analysis and fixing strategy, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Handle the case when there are leaves in the current line
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update the previous_defs based on the current depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line or between decorators
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the function with the corrected logic, it should now handle the cases more accurately and pass the failing tests.
