### Analysis:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- Inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` method, conditions check various properties of the `current_line` and the previous lines to determine the number of newlines to be inserted.
- There is a call to `self.previous_line.is_import` within one of the conditions, but `is_import` is not an attribute of `previous_line` itself.
- Instead, there is a function named `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` that should be used.

### Bug:
- The bug in the current code is that it checks `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming `previous_line` has an attribute `is_import`. However, `is_import` is actually a function that should be called with a `Leaf` as an argument.
- Due to this bug, the code tries to access an attribute that doesn't exist, resulting in an error during execution.

### Fix:
- Modify the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function with the correct leaf as an argument.
- Ensure that the function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` is correctly imported and accessible within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line.leaves[0])  # Call is_import function
        and not is_import(current_line.leaves[0])
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
