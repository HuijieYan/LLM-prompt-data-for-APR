### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.
2. The function checks conditions related to the current line, previous line, and some internal state variables like `previous_defs`.
3. The bug is due to the wrong implementation in the condition related to `is_import`. The function is incorrectly checking `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function defined outside the class.
4. To fix the bug, the function should call the `is_import` function to correctly check if the previous line is an import. Additionally, the previous line must be checked against `None` before using it in conditions.
5. The fix involves calling the `is_import` function correctly and using the correct conditions to determine the number of empty lines before and after the line.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line): # Call is_import function here
            # Don't insert empty lines between import lines.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line) # Call is_import function here
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the condition related to `is_import`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
