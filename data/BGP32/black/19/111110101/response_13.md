### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several conditional branches that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line.
2. The function uses various attributes of the `current_line` object to make decisions.
3. There is a condition that uses `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line is an import statement.
4. The `is_import` function is available in the same file and is referenced correctly, but it has not been passed the correct argument.
5. The failing test involves inserting comments within decorators, causing a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

### Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect comparison logic related to import statements. The function tries to access `self.previous_line.is_import` directly, but `self.previous_line` may not have the `is_import` attribute, leading to an attribute error and incorrect logic. This results in an incorrect number of empty lines being returned in some cases, causing the test failure.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly utilize the `is_import` function to determine if a line is an import statement. This involves calling the `is_import` function with the correct arguments each time we need to check for imports. We will also update the logic around import statements to handle them correctly based on the `is_import` function's return value.

### Updated Function
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.is_import(current_line):
            if (
                not self.is_import(self.previous_line)
                and depth == self.previous_line.depth
            ):
                return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not self.is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the updated function, we have introduced the `is_import` method calls to determine if a line is an import statement. This ensures that the code properly handles import-related logic and should address the bug in the original function.
