### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect usage of the `is_import` method. The function directly accesses `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line is an import statement, but it should be calling the `is_import` function instead.

Since `is_import` is a standalone function, the correct way to call it is by passing the `self.previous_line` as an argument to retrieve the boolean value representing whether the line is an import statement.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, modify the section of the code that checks if the previous line is an import statement. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with the correct function call `is_import(self.previous_line)`. This will ensure that the function checks the correct condition and behaves as intended.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between imports.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
