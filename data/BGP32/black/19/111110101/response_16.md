### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The function makes decisions about the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line based on certain conditions like `current_line.depth`, `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_import`, etc.
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of checking `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`.
- The failing test case shows a mismatch in the number of empty lines added in the output.
- The expected input/output variable values are provided for different scenarios that need to be satisfied.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when checking for import lines. The function incorrectly compares `self.previous_line.is_import` which is resulting in the wrong number of empty lines being inserted based on import conditions.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, ensure the correct comparison between `self.previous_line` and the relevant attributes is done. Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the correct comparison between `self.previous_line`'s `is_import` status and `current_line.is_import`, the function should now handle import-related conditions accurately. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in different scenarios.
