The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be corrected. Here is a breakdown of the causes of the bugs and a strategy to fix them:

1. The function does not correctly handle the condition for checking if the current line is an import statement. It tries to call `current_line.is_import` which is an attribute rather than a function. This leads to a runtime error.
2. The function does not correctly update the state of `previous_defs` when handling different types of statements. This results in incorrect behavior when determining the number of empty lines needed.

To fix the above issues, we need to make the following changes:
1. Update the condition for checking the import statement correctly by calling the `is_import` function defined in the same file.
2. Update the function logic to handle different statement types properly and update the `previous_defs` list accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the necessary fixes:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
