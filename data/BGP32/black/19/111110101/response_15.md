### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic around handling empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the current line, such as if it is a decorator, definition, flow control, import, or yield statement, and then decides the number of empty lines needed.

There are a few potential issues in the function:
1. The logic for reassigning the `before` variable within the `while` loop might not be correctly applied.
2. The check for `self.previous_line.is_import` is calling the method `is_import` instead of checking the attribute directly.
3. The handling of `before` values in different conditions seems to be inconsistent and may need to be revised.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Fix the reassignment of `before` within the `while` loop to ensure it behaves as intended.
2. Correct the check for `self.previous_line.is_import` by directly accessing the attribute.
3. Ensure consistency in handling `before` values based on different conditions and adjust if necessary.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these adjustments, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.
