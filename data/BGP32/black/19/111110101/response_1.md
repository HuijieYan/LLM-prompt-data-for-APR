### Bug analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is supposed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. 
2. The bug arises because `self.previous_line.is_import` is attempting to access the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line`, which should be a boolean value but it is not.
3. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function tries to handle various scenarios like decorators, definitions, imports, flow control, etc., to decide the number of empty lines needed.
4. One of the conditions, specifically related to import comparisons, attempts to access the `is_import` attribute from `self.previous_line` when it should check for boolean values directly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to refactor the part of the function where it compares `is_import` attributes.

### Bug fix
Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import', False)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using `getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import', False)` we ensure that the code does not throw an attribute error in case `is_import` attribute does not exist in `self.previous_line`. This helps avoid the bug and ensures the function works correctly in all scenarios, as expected.
