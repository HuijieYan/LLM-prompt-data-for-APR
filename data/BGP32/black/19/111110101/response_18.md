### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function due to the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import`, which leads to an AttributeError as there is no attribute `is_import` in the `Line` class. The error message indicates a comparison involving `self.previous_line.is_import`, which does not exist in the `Line` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Focus on the problematic comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` and adjust the logic to handle conditions where there is no `is_import` attribute in the `Line` class.
2. The issue could be resolved by utilizing the `is_import` function from the same file to determine if the current line is an import line.
3. Update the logic to properly handle situations where the `is_import` attribute is not available in the `Line` class.

### The Corrected Implementation:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, "is_import")
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By utilizing the `hasattr` function and checking for the existence of the attribute `is_import` in the `previous_line` object, we can safely handle cases where the attribute is not present directly in the `Line` class. This correction should resolve the AttributeError and ensure the function behaves correctly according to the expected input/output values specified.
