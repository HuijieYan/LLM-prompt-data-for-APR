### Analysis
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function seems to have issues with setting the appropriate number of empty lines based on different conditions such as decorators, imports, flow control, etc.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates a discrepancy in the expected and actual outputs when handling comments inside decorators.

### Bug
The bug in the function seems to be related to the handling of newlines before and after lines. Specifically, the conditions and calculations related to previous lines, decorators, imports, and yields seem to be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Correct the logic for empty line calculations based on the conditions provided.
2. Ensure that the appropriate number of empty lines are returned based on the context of the current line and previous lines.
3. Update the handling of decorators, imports, flow control, and yields to return the correct number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class
    
    if (is_decorator or is_def or is_class) and self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic and ensuring that the conditions for calculating empty lines are met, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases.
