### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The function has several conditions that determine the behavior based on the properties of the `current_line`, previous lines, and certain flags.
- There are multiple if-else blocks to handle different cases including decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.
- The bug arises from the condition where it compares `self.previous_line.is_import`, which should actually call the `is_import` function from the external file, but mistakenly compares it directly which leads to the failing test.

### Bug:
The bug is in the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` which should be calling the `is_import` function instead.

### Fix:
Modify the line `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function instead.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change, the corrected function will correctly call the `is_import` function to determine if the previous line is an import statement, fixing the buggy behavior and passing the failing test cases.
