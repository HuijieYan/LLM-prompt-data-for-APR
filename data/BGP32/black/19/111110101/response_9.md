### Buggy Function Analysis:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
- The function has multiple conditional blocks to determine the number of empty lines based on the properties of the input `current_line`.
- There is an issue with the comparison of properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line` causing incorrect behavior.
- The function modifies `current_line` leaves which can potentially lead to incorrect results in further processing.

### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug occurs when determining the number of before and after empty lines based on the properties of the current and previous lines. Specifically:
1. When checking if the previous line is an import statement, the function incorrectly uses `self.previous_line.is_import` directly. This results in unexpected behavior as the `is_import` function is not being called to check if the line is an import.
2. Modification of the `first_leaf.prefix` variable potentially alters the subsequent processing of the leaves of the current line.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Since the `is_import` function is available, it should be utilized to correctly check if the line is an import.
2. Avoid directly modifying the `prefix` of leaves in the current line to prevent unintended consequences during further processing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        # Remove modification of prefix to avoid unintended consequences
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Utilize the is_import function to correctly check if the line is an import
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### The corrected function addresses the issues with checking the import statement and modifying the leaves' prefix to ensure correct determination of empty lines.
