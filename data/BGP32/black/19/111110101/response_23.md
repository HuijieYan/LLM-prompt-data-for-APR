### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is incorrectly handling the conditions for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function is not correctly updating the `before` value based on certain conditions related to `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`.
- The issue arises in the calculation of the `before` value during the process of determining the number of empty lines.
- The buggy function is not properly handling the cases where `self.previous_line` is an import or a yield statement.
- The incorrect handling of these conditions leads to the wrong number of empty lines being returned by the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the `before` value is properly updated based on the conditions related to `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`.
- Correctly handle the cases where `self.previous_line` is an import or a yield statement to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import(Leaf()):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line in different scenarios, passing all the provided test cases.
