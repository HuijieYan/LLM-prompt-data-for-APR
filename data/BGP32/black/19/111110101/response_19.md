### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function calculates various conditions based on the input `current_line` and some internal state variables like `previous_defs`, `previous_line`.
3. The issue causing the bug is that the function incorrectly checks `self.previous_line` for some conditions like `is_import` and `is_yield`, but those attributes are not direct properties of the `current_line`.
4. To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly check the `current_line` properties for the specific conditions instead of relying on `self.previous_line`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth > 0:
        self.previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:depth - 1]

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_import_line = any(is_import(leaf) for leaf in current_line.leaves)
    is_yield_line = any(leaf.kind == YIELD for leaf in current_line.leaves)

    if self.previous_line and not is_import_line and not is_yield_line and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle the conditions based on the `current_line` properties and address the bug identified in the failing test case.
