### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` data class.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the input `current_line` to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The buggy function has several conditional checks based on different properties of `current_line` such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, etc.
4. The bug seems to be related to the condition where it checks for `current_line.is_import` which should be using the function `is_import` instead of the property `is_import`.
5. The failing test case involves comparing the actual and expected output when a comment is encountered within a decorator.

### Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect check for `current_line.is_import` when it should be calling the `is_import` function. This incorrect check causes the function to return different values than expected based on the test cases provided.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to replace the `current_line.is_import` check with `is_import(current_line)` to correctly determine if the line is an import. This change will ensure the function behaves as expected based on the test cases.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the condition checking related to imports, and the failing test case should pass as expected.
