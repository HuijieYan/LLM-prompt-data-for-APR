### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the logic to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are issues with the conditions and assignments within the function that are leading to incorrect results.

1. The function sets `max_allowed` to 1 initially, but it incorrectly sets it to 2 when `current_line.depth == 0`. This adjustment seems to be causing issues in determining the correct number of empty lines.
2. There are conditions related to the types of lines (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_import`, etc.) that are not being properly checked and handled, resulting in incorrect calculations of empty lines.
3. The management of `depth` and `previous_defs` to keep track of previous line types and depths seems to be inconsistent and may lead to incorrect decisions regarding empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Here are some steps for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the `max_allowed` value is set correctly based on the `depth`.
2. Review the conditions related to line types (`is_decorator`, `is_import`, etc.) and ensure that the logic for determining empty lines is correct for each case.
3. Verify the management of `depth` and `previous_defs` to accurately track and handle different line types.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1

        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        before = 0

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        depth = current_line.depth

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions and the handling of `max_allowed`, we aim to ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the specifics of the code structure.
