### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has multiple issues that need to be addressed:
1. The function is trying to access the attribute `is_import` directly on the `current_line` object, which results in an AttributeError since there is no `is_import` attribute defined for the `Line` class.
2. There are inconsistencies in the logic of checking for conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`, which leads to incorrect behavior.
3. The use of `self.previous_defs` to handle the depth levels is flawed as it does not correctly update the previous depth and handle cases where it should append a depth value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix these issues, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the function to utilize the `is_import` function defined outside the class to determine if the current line is an import.
2. Revise the logic surrounding the conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to ensure correct handling of empty lines.
3. Adjust the handling of depth levels using `self.previous_defs` to maintain the correct history of depth values and updates.

### Bug-free Version:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < depth]
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_current_line_import = is_import(current_line)
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_current_line_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the logic correctly and pass the failing test cases.
