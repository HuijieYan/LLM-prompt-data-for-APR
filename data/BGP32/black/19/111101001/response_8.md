### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after a given line based on specific conditions. 

One of the primary issues causing the bug is related to how the function operates when determining whether to insert empty lines before and after a line. The logic for checking certain conditions and updating variables like `before`, `newlines`, and `is_decorator` is flawed. 

Additionally, there is an incorrect comparison in the condition `if depth == self.previous_line.depth` when checking for imports. This comparison is flawed and leads to incorrect results when processing import statements.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function by addressing the following issues:
1. Update the way `before`, `newlines`, and `is_decorator` are calculated to accurately determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
2. Correct the comparison in the import condition to ensure that the depth comparison between the current line and the previous line is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
            and not current_line.is_import
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the defined conditions. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
