### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when checking whether the `current_line` is an import. The function checks if the `self.previous_line` is an import and the `current_line` is not an import and if the depth of both lines is the same. However, the comparison of `self.previous_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_import` is incorrect. The function mistakenly accesses the `is_import` attribute directly on the `self.previous_line` object without calling the `is_import` function defined outside the class. This leads to incorrect behavior and causes the failing test cases.

Additionally, the logic of handling newlines in different cases is not consistent, which may lead to incorrect newline adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import.
2. Adjust the logic for handling newlines consistently to ensure proper calculation and insertion of newlines based on the surrounding context.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the suggested corrections and ensuring a consistent handling of newlines, the corrected function should pass the failing tests.
