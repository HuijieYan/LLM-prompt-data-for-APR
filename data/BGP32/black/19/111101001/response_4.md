### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect comparison of `current_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function to check if the current line is an import statement in the code. This leads to incorrect logic in determining whether to insert empty lines based on the previous line and the current line's characteristics.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from directly accessing the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` object instead of calling the `is_import` function. This results in incorrect comparisons for determining whether to insert empty lines in certain conditions, leading to failed test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if the previous line is an import statement by calling the `is_import` function on both the current and previous lines. Additionally, we should remove the unnecessary direct check for `is_import` attribute in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By calling the `is_import` function in the correct locations and removing unnecessary attribute checks, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
