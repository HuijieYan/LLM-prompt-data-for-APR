### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the comparison `and self.previous_line.is_import` where we are checking the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line`. 

From the provided runtime values and types for Case 2, we can see that `self.previous_line` is an instance of `Line` which does not have an attribute `is_import`. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `is_import` on `self.previous_line`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to refactor the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` to instead check if the previous line is an import. This way, we can avoid accessing an attribute that doesn't exist on the `Line` object.

### Corrected Function
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and any(lline.is_import for lline in self.previous_line.leaves)
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and any(lline.is_yield for lline in self.previous_line.leaves)
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

By updating the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` to instead check if any leaves in `self.previous_line` are imports, we can avoid the AttributeError and fix the bug.
