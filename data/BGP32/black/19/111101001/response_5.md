### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition block where it checks if the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` is True. The bug arises from comparing `self.previous_line.is_import` against `current_line.is_import`, with an assumption that `previous_line` in all cases will have an `is_import` attribute. However, in one of the test cases provided, the `previous_line` does not have an `is_import` attribute, resulting in a runtime error and causing the test case to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check that involves the `is_import` attribute comparison. We should check if `self.previous_line` exists before comparing the `is_import` attribute. If `self.previous_line` exists and it has an `is_import` attribute, we can proceed with the comparison. Otherwise, we can handle this case separately to prevent runtime errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_decorator') and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditional checks with appropriate attribute existence checks, we can avoid runtime errors related to non-existent attributes and ensure that the function works correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing tests.
