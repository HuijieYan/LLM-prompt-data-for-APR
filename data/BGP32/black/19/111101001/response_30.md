#### Potential issues in the buggy function:
1. Inconsistent handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.
2. Incorrect modification of `before` variable which should represent the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the current line.

#### Bug Explanation:
The `before` variable in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is being modified in multiple places within the function based on different conditions. This leads to incorrect calculation and handling of the number of potential empty lines needed before the current line. Inconsistent handling of this variable results in incorrect empty line placement based on the various conditions in the function.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of the `before` variable to accurately calculate the number of empty lines needed before the current line. We should also ensure that the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the current line are correctly evaluated.

#### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 1, 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return 1, 0

    if current_line.depth:
        newlines = 1
    else:
        newlines = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        elif not self.previous_line:  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line
            return 0, 0
        else:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    return before, newlines
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of the `before` variable, evaluates conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the current line accurately, and simplifies the logic for better readability and reliability. This should address the issues identified and pass the failing test cases.
