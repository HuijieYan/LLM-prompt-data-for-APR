### Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic that checks the type of the previous line and determines whether to insert empty lines. The bug causes incorrect handling of scenarios where the current line is not an import, but the previous line is an import. The function incorrectly inserts empty lines in such cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic that checks the type of the previous line and whether the current line is an import to correctly determine when to insert empty lines.
2. Ensure that appropriate conditions are met before inserting empty lines.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the bug and pass the failing test scenarios provided. It correctly handles scenarios where the previous line is an import and ensures that empty lines are inserted based on the correct conditions.
