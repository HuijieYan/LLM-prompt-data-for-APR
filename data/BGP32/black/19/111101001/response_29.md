### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from an incorrect condition check on line 54 that checks if `self.previous_line` is an import. The buggy line is:
```python
and self.previous_line.is_import
```
However, the `self.previous_line` is actually an instance of the `Line` class and not directly an import, hence causing the condition to fail and the function not returning the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition on line 54 to check if the `self.previous_line` has an import leaf within its leaves rather than directly checking if it's an import. This modification will ensure that the correct condition is being checked based on the structure of the Line objects being used.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and any(leaf.type == Name and leaf.value == "import" for leaf in self.previous_line.leaves)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change and modifying the condition on line 54 to check for an import leaf within the leaves of `self.previous_line`, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
