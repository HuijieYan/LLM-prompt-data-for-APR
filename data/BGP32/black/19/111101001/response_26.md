### Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition checking for `current_line.is_import`. The function is trying to check if the previous line was an import (by calling `self.previous_line.is_import`) and the current line is not an import, but the condition in the if statement is incorrect. The function is trying to access the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line`, but since `is_import` is a separate function (and not an attribute), it leads to an AttributeError and causes the function to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function that was defined in the same file to correctly check if the previous line was an import.
2. Update the condition to correctly compare whether the previous line was an import and the current line is not an import.
3. Make sure to handle the case where `self.previous_line` might be `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(current_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the condition checking for `is_import`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
