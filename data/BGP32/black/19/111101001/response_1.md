### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from a logical flaw in handling empty lines before and after certain types of lines in the input code. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line being processed. 

The function is designed to handle different cases based on the type of the current line, such as decorators, function definitions, flow control statements, imports, and yields. The issue lies in the incorrect handling of line types, specifically with decorators, imports, and yields, leading to improper calculation of the number of empty lines needed.

### Bug Location
The bug originates in the logic for determining the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line based on its type. The conditional checks that differentiate between various line types (decorators, imports, yields) are not accurately implemented, leading to incorrect computations of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the conditional checks that handle different line types and ensure that the logic accurately reflects the requirements for determining the number of empty lines. Specifically, we need to adjust the conditions for decorators, imports, and yields to calculate the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield(current_line, depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- We adjusted the conditions for handling decorators, imports, and yields to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the type of the current line.
- The function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line, resolving the bug that caused the failing tests. 

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
