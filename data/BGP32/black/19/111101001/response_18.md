### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation depth for previous lines, especially when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. This leads to incorrect calculations and results in failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `before` variable and handling the `depth` of previous lines needs to be revised. The function should accurately determine the appropriate number of empty lines based on the current line properties and the relationship with the previous line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version improves the logic for determining the number of empty lines required before and after the current line based on its properties and the relationship with the previous line. It handles the indentation depth and updates the `before` variable appropriately.

By using this corrected version, the function should now pass the failing tests.
