### Bug Explanation
The main issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the conditions for returning the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. One particular problematic condition is the check for `self.previous_line.is_import` which directly calls the `is_import` method of the `Line` class, when it should actually check `self.previous_line.is_import()` to call the `is_import` function defined outside the class.

Additionally, there are some logic errors in the function that lead to incorrect values being returned based on the condition checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the check `self.previous_line.is_import` to `self.previous_line.is_import()`.
2. Fix the logic related to determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
3. Make sure that the function behaves correctly based on the input parameters and the surrounding conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import()` function is properly used to check if the previous line is an import statement. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been adjusted to provide correct results based on the input parameters and the conditions.
