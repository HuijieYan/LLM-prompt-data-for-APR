The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional statement checking whether `self.previous_line` is an import. The issue arises from attempting to access the `is_import` attribute directly on the `previous_line` object, which is incorrect. Instead, we need to call the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as the parameter to properly determine if the previous line is an import.

To fix this bug, we need to update the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly utilize the `is_import` function. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version correctly calls the `is_import` function to check if the previous line is an import, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
