The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect condition checks and variable updates. The function is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions such as decorators, imports, flow control, and more.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The variable `newlines` is set to `2`, possibly indicating two newlines to be inserted before the current line in certain conditions.
2. However, in the case where `current_line.is_decorator` is `False`, the function appends `depth` to `self.previous_defs`. If this condition is met, the expected behavior is to return `0, 0` and not `2, 0`.
3. Additionally, the condition `if not is_decorator` should be handled differently for the correct behavior of detecting decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the condition for setting `newlines` to handle decorators correctly.
2. Ensure that the appropriate values are returned based on the corrected conditions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not (current_line.is_yield and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function returns the expected number of newlines based on the input conditions and handles decorators and other cases appropriately.
