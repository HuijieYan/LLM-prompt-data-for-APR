The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to incorrect handling of conditions related to newlines and depth, leading to unexpected return values. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly compute the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    # Handle cases based on line type
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. It avoids the inconsistencies that led to the bug, ensuring that the expected return values are generated based on the given inputs and conditions.
