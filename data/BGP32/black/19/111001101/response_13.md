### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the comparison of the value of the `is_import` attribute. The function compares `self.previous_line.is_import` with `current_line.is_import` to determine whether to return empty lines. However, `self.previous_line.is_import` is intended to call the `is_import` function, but instead, it is erroneously comparing it as an attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function correctly on `self.previous_line` and `current_line` instead of directly comparing them. By invoking the `is_import` function, we ensure that the correct value is retrieved for the comparison.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker(): 
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
