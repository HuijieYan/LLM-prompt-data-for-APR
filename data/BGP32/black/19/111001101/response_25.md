The bug in the provided function is due to a logical condition that incorrectly checks if the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object in the `self` instance is a method, rather than checking if a specific function `is_import` is called with the `previous_line` object as an argument.

To fix the bug, the logical condition that checks for the `current_line.is_import` attribute should be modified to check if the `is_import` function is called with the `current_line` object as an argument.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: black_corrected.py

def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the logical condition related to the `is_import` function, ensuring that the correct behavior is maintained based on the input values and type expectations specified in the test cases.
