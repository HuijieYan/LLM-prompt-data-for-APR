## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the incorrect check for `is_import` within the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`. There is an attempt to call `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming it is a function to check if a line is an import. However, `self.previous_line` is just a variable referencing the previous line, and it does not have an `is_import` method. This causes the function to fail when trying to access a non-existing attribute/method.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly check whether the `current_line` is an import line, instead of trying to access a non-existing method on `self.previous_line`.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.is_import:
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected function, we replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with `current_line.is_import` to properly check if the current line is an import statement. This change ensures that the function correctly identifies import lines and can proceed without throwing an error.
