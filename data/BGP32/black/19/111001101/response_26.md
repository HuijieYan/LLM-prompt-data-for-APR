## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition where it checks `current_line.is_import`. The issue arises because `current_line.is_import` is incorrectly used as an attribute directly on the `current_line` object. However, the `is_import` function is defined separately outside of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, and it needs to be called to check if `current_line` is an import line. 

Therefore, the error occurs because `current_line.is_import` is considered a direct attribute of `current_line`, but in reality, it should be checked using the `is_import` function.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function to properly check if the current line is an import line. We can modify the corresponding line in the code to use the `is_import` function correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the `is_import` function is properly used to check if the current line is an import line, fixing the bug in the original function.
