## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of additional empty lines necessary before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. The function uses multiple conditions to determine the number of empty lines required, considering attributes of the `current_line` and the previous line.

### Identified Issues
1. The function incorrectly checks for `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` by directly calling the `is_import` method on the `Line` instances. However, the actual check should involve calling the `is_import` function defined outside the class and passing the respective `Leaf` instances to determine if the line is an import line.
2. The logic for managing the `previous_defs` attribute to keep track of indentation levels seems incomplete. The function pops the last item off `previous_defs` when the current line's depth is less than or equal to the last item. This operation might not properly restore the previous state in all cases.

### Bug Causes
1. The direct usage of `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect due to referencing attributes that should be determined by a distinct function.
2. Inefficient handling of `previous_defs` for tracking indentation levels can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the import check to use the `is_import` function correctly by passing the required `Leaf` instances.
2. Enhance the logic for managing the `previous_defs` attribute for robust tracking of indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(current_line)  # Corrected the check using 'is_import' function
            and not is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected the check using 'is_import' function
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines based on the provided conditions, addressing the issues identified during the analysis.
