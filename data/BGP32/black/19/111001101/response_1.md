The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly setting the value of `before` within the `while` loop. The bug is causing unexpected behavior when `self.previous_line` is an import or yield statement.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value doesn't get overwritten when updating it within the loop. We should update it only if it hasn't been set previously.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    initial_before = before  # Store the initial value of before

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return initial_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (initial_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (initial_before or 1), 0

    return initial_before, 0
```

In the corrected code, we introduced `initial_before` to store the initial value of `before`, preventing it from being overwritten within the loop. This ensures that we retain the correct value of `before` for subsequent comparisons.

Now, the function should handle the cases correctly and return the expected values for the given inputs.
