## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line. The issue arises when handling previous definitions and determining the number of empty lines based on the current line type.

- In Case 1, the test is failing because the function incorrectly returns `(newlines, 0)` when it should be returning `(0, 0)`. The issue lies in the logic for decorators, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the number of newlines.
- In Case 2, the function returns `(newlines, 0)` instead of the expected `(0, 0)`. Again, the logic for handling decorators is incorrect.
- In Cases 3, 4, and 6, similar issues occur with incorrect calculations in the decorator handling logic.
- Case 7 fails due to an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted based on the type of the current line.
- In Case 8, the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the current line's depth.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic related to decorators and other line types to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted before and after each line, as expected by the test cases.

## Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 0 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now provide the expected number of empty lines before and after each line, fixing the issues identified in the failing test cases.
