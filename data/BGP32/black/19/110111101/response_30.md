### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is occurring because the `before` variable is being overwritten in a certain condition where it should not be. The issue lies in the following block of code:

```python
while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
```

In this block, for each `depth` value encountered where `self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth`, the `before` variable is being set to either `1` if `depth` is truthy, or `2` if `depth` is falsy, which effectively resets the `before` value incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, update the block of code to ensure that the `before` variable is only changed when it is necessary. We can achieve this by introducing a new variable to keep track of the updated `before` value without overwriting it. This adjustment will maintain the correct `before` value in scenarios where it should not be altered.

### The Corrected Function:

```python
# The corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    new_before = before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        new_before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    before = new_before

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the `before` variable only when necessary and storing the new value separately, we ensure that the correct logic is followed and the function should now work as expected for the failing tests.
