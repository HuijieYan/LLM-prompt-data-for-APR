### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to incorrectly handling the calculation of the number of empty lines that should be added or removed based on certain conditions. The function is designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The function's logic seems to be correct in most cases, but the issue is with how it handles certain scenarios, such as decorators and flow control statements. The incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines results in a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully analyze the conditions and adjust the logic to accurately determine the number of empty lines required. Specifically, we need to focus on the conditions related to decorators, flow control statements, and imports, as they seem to be the primary sources of the issue.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            newlines = 2

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By addressing the specific conditions causing the incorrect number of empty lines, this corrected version of the function is expected to pass the failing test cases and provide the correct output based on the input parameters.
