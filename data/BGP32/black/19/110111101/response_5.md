The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of empty lines before and after certain types of lines in the code. The function is not efficiently determining the number of empty lines needed based on the current line properties, which leads to incorrect formatting in the output.

### Issues:
1. The function is not properly updating the `before` variable in all cases.
2. In some cases, the function returns incorrect numbers of newlines.

### Bug Explanation:
When analyzing the failing test results, it's evident that the function is returning incorrect results which lead to formatting mismatches in the output. This is likely due to not updating the `before` variable properly and returning incorrect newline counts in certain scenarios.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly in all branches.
2. Verify the logic for determining newlines to be inserted based on the current line's properties.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the function as mentioned above, the incorrect formatting issues observed in the failing tests should be resolved, and the corrected version should match the expected output.
