### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in how it handles the `before` variable when considering previous definitions. In the while loop where it checks and possibly pops previous definitions, it always sets `before` to either `1` or `2` if the condition holds true. This overwrites the `before` value calculated earlier in the function, causing incorrect behavior when deciding on the number of empty lines to return.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to preserve the `before` value calculated based on the number of newlines in the `prefix` of the first leaf, and not overwrite it in the while loop. We should only update `before` with `1` or `2` when necessary based on the conditions in the function.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring that we preserve the calculated `before` value for the potential extra empty lines and only update it when necessary, the fixed function should now correctly return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.
