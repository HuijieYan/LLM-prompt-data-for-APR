### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the code decides to return early and not calculate the needed empty lines before and after the current line based on certain conditions. These conditions lead to incorrect handling of empty lines, resulting in differences between the expected and actual output of the test cases.

1. The function is not correctly updating the `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` attributes in all scenarios, leading to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly updates the `self.previous_line` and `self.previous_defs` attributes in all relevant scenarios. Additionally, the function should correctly calculate and return the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the given conditions.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that the failing test cases will pass as expected.
