## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the inconsistent handling of `before` variable. The function is supposed to return the number of extra empty lines needed both before and after the currently processed line. However, there are scenarios where the value of `before` is being incorrectly set to `1` or `2`, causing the discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs.

In the provided cases, when the conditions for `current_line.is_decorator` or `current_line.is_flow_control` are satisfied, the function should return the appropriate values for `newlines` and `before`. However, due to the incorrect handling of `before` in certain cases, the function is not returning the expected number of empty lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the specific conditions within the function. We should carefully evaluate each conditional block where `before` is assigned a value and verify that it aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly calculate the necessary number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, passing the failing test cases and aligning with the expected behavior.
