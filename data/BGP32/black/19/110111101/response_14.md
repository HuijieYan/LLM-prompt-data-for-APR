### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the computation of the `before` variable when handling cases where a line is a decorator or a flow control block. The incorrect calculation leads to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after certain lines, resulting in the failing test cases.

1. The function incorrectly assigns values to `before` in different conditional branches, leading to inconsistencies in the number of empty lines expected before the current line.
2. The conditionals for setting the number of newlines before and after the current line are not correctly handling decorator, flow control, import, and yield cases, resulting in unexpected outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the line properties such as being a decorator, flow control block, import statement, or yield statement. We should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted as expected by the failing test cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
from collections import deque
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    previous_line: Optional[Line]
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorporates the necessary adjustments to handle the different cases of line properties accurately, ensuring the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions. This correction should now pass the failing test cases provided.
