### Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions related to the structure of the code. However, the function appears to have several issues causing it to produce incorrect results, leading to failing test cases. Here are some key points contributing to the bugs:

1. The function assigns `max_allowed = 1` at the beginning but later reassigns `max_allowed = 2` based on a condition without considering the previous assigned value. This can lead to incorrect calculations.

2. The function modifies the `prefix` attribute of the `first_leaf`, which affects the input line object, potentially disrupting the data integrity.

3. There are multiple conditional statements handling different scenarios to determine the number of empty lines required before and after the current line. However, depending on the specific conditions, the logic may not cover all edge cases correctly.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the issues in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and address the failing test cases, we need to follow these strategies:

1. Ensure that the `max_allowed` variable is correctly handled and updated based on conditions without losing its original value.

2. Avoid modifying the input line object `prefix` attribute but instead work with temporary variables to calculate the required number of empty lines.

3. Refactor the conditional logic to cover all possible scenarios and make sure that the function correctly handles different types of code structures.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Calculate the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf
        before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth > 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying the fixes mentioned above and adjusting the logic in the function, the corrected version should be able to handle various scenarios and pass the failing test cases successfully.
