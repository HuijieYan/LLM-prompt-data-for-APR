### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation and determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line. In multiple cases, the function is incorrectly setting the values for `before` and `newlines`, leading to incorrect results and causing the failing tests.

In Case 1, the function is failing for the identifier `@property` where it correctly sets `max_allowed` based on the `depth`. However, in some other cases like Case 3, Case 5, and Case 6, the current implementation does not reset `before` to 0 properly, which causes incorrect calculations for empty lines. Additionally, the management of `newlines` and the conditionals may also need adjustments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that `before` is correctly set based on the conditions and then use it appropriately when calculating the number of empty lines to insert before a line. The flow control statements and conditionals need to be reviewed to align with the expected behavior described in the test cases.

### Updated Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield and depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Conclusion
The updated `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the calculation of empty lines before and after a line based on the given conditions and edge cases identified in the failing test cases. The adjustments made in the function should align with the expected output and resolve the bug.
