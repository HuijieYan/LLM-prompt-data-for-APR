### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines based on the conditions provided. The function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, the conditions inside the function are not being checked in the correct logical order and some specific conditions are causing the function to return incorrect values.

Here are some key issues causing the bug:
1. The conditions related to decorators, classes, and definitions are not being checked in the correct logical sequence, leading to incorrect newlines being returned.
2. The logic for handling specific cases like decorators, imports, and yields is not accounting for all possible scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs to be revised to correctly handle the conditions and return the appropriate number of empty lines before and after the current line. Here are some steps to address the issues:
1. Rearrange the order of conditions to ensure that the correct logic is applied for different scenarios.
2. Add necessary checks for cases like decorators, imports, and yields to handle them correctly.
3. Simplify the logic to make it more straightforward and easier to follow.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the identified issues and ensures that the function returns the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    newlines_before = 0
    newlines_after = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines_before = 0
        else:
            newlines_before = 2
    elif current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines_before = 1
    elif current_line.is_import:
        if not self.previous_line.is_import or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            newlines_before = 1
    elif current_line.is_yield:
        if not self.previous_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            newlines_before = 1
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines_before = 0
        newlines_after = 1
    else:
        newlines_before = 0

    return newlines_before, newlines_after
```

With the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the issues identified in the failing test cases should be resolved, and the function should now return the correct number of empty lines before and after the processed line based on the conditions provided.
