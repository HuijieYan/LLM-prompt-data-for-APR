### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The issue lies in how the function handles updating the `before` variable and determining the newlines to be inserted. In some cases, the logic for updating `before` and `newlines` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully analyze the logic used to update `before` and calculate the number of newlines to insert. We should ensure that the conditions and checks in the function are correctly handling different scenarios to provide the expected output.

### Updated and Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update the logic to correctly handle updating 'before' based on previous definitions
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - depth
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By carefully adjusting the logic for updating `before` and calculating the newlines to insert based on different conditions, the corrected function should now provide the expected output and pass the failing tests.
