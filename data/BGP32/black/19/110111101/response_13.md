### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. In the failing test, the function fails to provide the expected output, resulting in a test assertion error.

Here are the identified issues:
1. In Case 1, the function should return `(0, 0)` when the conditions for decorators are met. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of newlines and returns `(2, 0)` instead.
2. In Case 2, the function should return `(0, 0)` when the conditions for decorators are met. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of newlines and returns `(2, 0)` instead.
3. In Case 5, the function should return `(0, 0)` when the conditions for decorators are met. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of newlines and returns `(2, 0)` instead.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to correctly determine the number of newlines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the specified conditions. Specifically, the function should handle cases involving decorators properly and return the expected output `(0, 0)`.

### Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

By correcting the logic within the function, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected number of newlines both before and after the current line based on the specified conditions.
