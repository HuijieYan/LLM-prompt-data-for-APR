### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from incorrect handling of the `before` value. When computing `before`, the function sometimes resets the value to `1` when it should remain `0`. This reset happens in the while loop where it should only be set if `depth` is not zero.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic that sets the `before` value. We need to ensure that the `before` value is updated correctly based on the conditions provided in the function.

### Updated Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:  # Only reset 'before' if depth is 0
            before = 2 if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_def else 1
    
    # Handle different scenarios based on the line type
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By modifying the reset condition for the `before` variable inside the while loop, we ensure that it only gets reset to `2` when `depth` is not zero. This correction should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in all scenarios.
