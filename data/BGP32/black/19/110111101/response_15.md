### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines before and after a line of code in certain scenarios. This results in a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output, causing the failing test.

1. In cases where `current_line` is a decorator, a definition, or a class, incorrect logic in the function leads to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines before the current line. This can lead to a misinterpretation of the formatting rules, causing mismatches in test outputs.

2. Another issue arises when handling flow control lines, import lines, and yield lines, impacting the calculation of the number of empty lines before or after the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review and adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure correct calculations for the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on different conditions. We should validate each conditional block to address the cases mentioned above that lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that should address the issues outlined above:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            if current_line.depth not in self.previous_defs:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    return before, 0
```

By replacing the existing `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class with this corrected version, the function should now compute the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specified conditions, resolving the bug and allowing the failing tests to pass.
