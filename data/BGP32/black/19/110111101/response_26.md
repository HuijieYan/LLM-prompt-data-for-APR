## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable and the conditions where the number of extra newlines is calculated. The expected behavior is to adjust the number of potential extra newlines required before and after the currently processed line based on specific conditions like decorators, class definitions, flow control statements, etc. However, due to the incorrect logic, the function fails to determine the correct number of newlines needed, leading to failing tests and assertion errors.

### Identified Issues:
1. Incorrect manipulation of the `before` variable: The `before` variable is calculated initially based on the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf. However, subsequent modifications and conditions do not properly adjust this value, leading to inconsistencies.
2. Inconsistent handling of required newlines based on statement types: The logic for determining the number of newlines before and after the line has several cases and conditions but fails to correctly follow through with the expected outcomes.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function needs adjustment to properly handle the calculation of the number of potential extra newlines required before and after the line based on the specific conditions provided in the function. It is important to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly and that the function follows the expected behavior for different types of statements.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the manipulation of the `before` variable and ensuring the correct conditions for adjusting the number of newlines are met, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing tests.
