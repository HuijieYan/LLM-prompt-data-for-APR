### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line based on certain conditions. The bug causes incorrect empty line counts to be returned, leading to a failed test due to incorrect formatting of the code.

1. When `current_line.is_decorator` is True, the expected behavior is to handle decorators and set the correct number of empty lines. However, the logic for handling decorators and empty lines is flawed, leading to incorrect output.
2. There are issues in updating `before` and `newlines` variables based on the conditions specified in the function, causing discrepancies in the expected empty lines count.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling decorators and determining empty line counts needs to be revised. Specifically, the correct conditions for setting `before` and `newlines` need to be clearly defined and implemented to ensure the function returns the expected empty line counts.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves and current_line.leaves[0].prefix:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        before = min(current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        current_line.leaves[0].prefix = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.lstrip()
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

Please replace the existing `_maybe_empty_lines` function in your code with this corrected version to ensure the correct behavior and pass the failing test.
