### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the improper handling of the `before` variable when calculating the number of indentation lines expected before the current line. In some conditions, the `before` value is updated without considering the maximum allowed value. This leads to incorrect adjustments and ultimately results in the output not matching the expected values.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in the logic around assigning the `before` variable. Particularly, the `before` value should be constrained by the `max_allowed` value to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed lines. However, in the current implementation, the `before` value is being updated even when it exceeds the `max_allowed` value, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the `max_allowed` value. When setting the `before` value, we should use the minimum of the calculated `before` value and the `max_allowed` value. This adjustment will prevent the `before` value from exceeding the maximum allowed lines.

### Updated Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return min(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return min(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying this fix, the `before` variable is correctly constrained by the `max_allowed` value, ensuring the output aligns with the expected results.
