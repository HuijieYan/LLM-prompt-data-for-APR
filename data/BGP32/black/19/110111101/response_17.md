### Bug Analysis:
After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not handling the scenarios related to decorators and empty lines correctly. The function is not updating the stateful tracker `EmptyLineTracker` properly based on the conditions specified.

1. In the failing test case, there are issues with the expected and actual output related to empty lines before and after the line with comments. The function is not adding the correct number of empty lines as expected before and after decorators and comments.

2. The function is missing proper state updates related to `EmptyLineTracker` before returning the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and make the function `_maybe_empty_lines` work correctly, we need to ensure the following:
- Update the `EmptyLineTracker` state based on the conditions and line types encountered.
- Handle decorators, comments, class and function definitions, and flow control blocks properly to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Check if the line has leaves
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the extra newlines from the first leaf's prefix
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update previous definitions and empty line count based on conditions
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating and correcting the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis and bug fix strategy, the corrected function should now handle the scenarios related to decorators, comments, functions, and other line types correctly and provide the expected number of empty lines before and after the lines as required.
