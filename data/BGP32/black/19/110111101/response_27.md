### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable when `depth` is 0. When the function encounters a decorator or a `def` or `class` keyword, it checks if the `depth` is 0 and sets `before = 2` in those cases. However, in subsequent logic, when handling certain conditions, the code incorrectly resets `before = 1 if depth else 2`, effectively ignoring the initial setting of `before` based on the `depth` value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the value of `before` set based on the `depth` at the start of the function is retained and used correctly in all subsequent conditions. We can achieve this by adjusting the logic that updates `before` to consider the initial value if `depth` is not 0.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    # Check for decorators, def, and class
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def = current_line.is_def
    is_class = current_line.is_class

    if is_decorator or is_def or is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditional logic that modifies the `before` variable based on the `depth`, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test scenarios.
