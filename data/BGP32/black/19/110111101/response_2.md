## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of the `depth` and `max_allowed` variables. When determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line, the function does not correctly update these variables based on the conditions and specific line types. This leads to incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines in certain situations, causing the failing test cases.

### Issues in the Buggy Function
1. The `max_allowed` value is set based on `depth` only when `current_line.depth == 0`, but it should be updated based on certain line types as well.
2. The handling of `before` and `newlines` variables is not consistent across different conditions, leading to incorrect results.
3. The logic for updating `depth` and `before` in the while loop is causing unexpected behavior and may not be correctly updating the values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Ensure that `max_allowed` is properly updated in all relevant conditions.
2. Revise the logic related to `before` and `newlines` to be consistent and accurate.
3. Correct the behavior in the while loop to update `before` correctly when removing items from `previous_defs`.

## Bug-free Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0 or current_line.is_decorator:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines += 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the function as presented above, it should now correctly handle the various conditions and return the expected number of empty lines both before and after the current line. This corrected version should resolve the issues causing the failing test cases.
