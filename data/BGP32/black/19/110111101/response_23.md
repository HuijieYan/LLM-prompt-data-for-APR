Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug seems to be related to the logic around handling the empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert in certain cases, leading to incorrect formatting.

The bug may lie in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. There are multiple conditions and checks in the function that influence this decision, and it appears that the handling of these conditions is not producing the expected results.

To address this bug, we can adjust the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly account for the different cases and conditions that affect the number of empty lines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.depth > self.previous_line.depth:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and handles the conditions more effectively to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert. By making these adjustments, the function should now produce the expected output for the given test cases.
