## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions such as the line's depth, specific types of lines (e.g., decorator, def, class), and the previous line's properties.

### Issues
1. Inconsistent handling: The conditions to determine the number of empty lines before and after the line are not being consistently applied.
2. Incorrect reassignment: The reassignment of `before` variable within the loop is causing incorrect behavior.
3. Missing updates: The handling of line types like def is not updating the tracker properly.

### Bug Cause
The key cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistent application of logic based on different line types and incorrect reassignment of the `before` variable leading to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure consistent handling of different line types and conditions.
2. Properly update the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` and its variables to reflect the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the line.

## Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    # Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import \
            and not current_line.is_import \
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line \
            and self.previous_line.is_yield \
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By fixing the inconsistent application of logic and ensuring proper variable updates, this corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected number of empty lines before and after the processed line based on the specified conditions.
