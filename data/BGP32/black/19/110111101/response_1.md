### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class seems to be related to how newlines are handled before and after lines. The function manages where extra empty lines should be inserted based on various conditions related to the current line and the previous lines. However, in the failing test cases, the function is not producing the expected output for handling comments or decorators, resulting in assertion errors.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to stem from the logic related to handling decorators, comments, and line types like imports, yields, and flow control statements. The conditions where newlines should be inserted are not being calculated correctly in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the failing test case, there are scenarios where comments and decorators are present, and the function is failing to compute the correct number of newlines before or after those lines.
2. The function is not correctly handling scenarios where empty lines should be skipped between decorators or before the first line in the file.
3. Incorrect handling of cases like imports, yields, and flow control statements is causing the function to deviate from the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic for handling decorators, comments, imports, yields, and flow control statements is correctly implemented to compute the required empty lines before and after each line.
2. Update the conditions and calculations for determining when to insert newlines based on the current line's properties to match the expected behavior.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed_before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed_before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating and correcting the logic in the function as outlined above, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now behave correctly and pass the failing tests when handling decorators, comments, and other line types.
