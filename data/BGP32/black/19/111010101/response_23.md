#### Analysis
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The function checks different conditions based on the attributes of the `current_line` parameter and some attributes of the class instance (`self`).
- The buggy function has various conditional branches that determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
- The function has several references to other attributes and methods of the class, such as `previous_defs`, `previous_line`, and others.

#### Bug
The bug in the function is related to the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` during the execution. The function tries to access the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line`, assuming it's a callable function, but it's actually an attribute of the `Line` object. This leads to the error message related to comparison issues in the failing test cases.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly check whether `self.previous_line` represents an import line by accessing its attributes directly, rather than treating it as a function call. We should check the `is_import` attribute directly rather than calling it like a function.

#### Corrected Implementation
```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # Fixed version of the function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and hasattr(self.previous_line, "is_import")
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and hasattr(self.previous_line, "is_yield")
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly compare the attributes of `self.previous_line` without causing attribute errors. It addresses the bug related to incorrectly treating `is_import` as a function. The function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
