### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after a given line.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted.
3. The bug lies in the condition checking block related to imports. The function is trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` directly, but `is_import` is a function, not a property of `Line`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the previous line is an import by calling the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument instead of directly checking the `is_import` property.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Replace the problematic `self.previous_line.is_import` check with a call to the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as an argument.
2. Verify the conditions properly to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the logic of the function.

### Revised Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the bug as described above, the function should now correctly handle the case where the previous line is an import. The function should now pass all the test cases provided with the expected input and output values.
