### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function checks various conditions based on the `current_line` parameter and modifies several variables accordingly.
3. The bug occurs when trying to access the `is_import` property of `current_line` using `self.previous_line.is_import`, as `is_import` is a function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` and not a property of the `Line` class.
4. This incorrect usage leads to incorrect behavior in the function and causes the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the condition that checks `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly use the `is_import` function with the appropriate parameters.
2. Ensure that the `is_import` function is called with the correct `leaf` parameter to determine if the condition should be met.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function will correctly call the `is_import` function and avoid the bug related to incorrect property access.
