### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug in the conditional check related to the `is_import` attribute of `current_line` and `previous_line`. The error message indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs when dealing with comments within decorators.

The bug arises from incorrectly accessing the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` instance. The buggy function attempts to check `self.previous_line.is_import` without considering that `self.previous_line` might be `None`. This leads to a runtime error when trying to access the attribute of a `None` object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` attribute is accessed correctly even when `self.previous_line` is `None`. We can achieve this by explicitly checking if `self.previous_line` is not `None` before attempting to access its attributes.

### The corrected version of the buggy code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import', False)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using `getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import', False)` in the conditional check, we safely handle the case where `self.previous_line` might be `None` without triggering an error. This correction ensures that the function behaves as expected and correctly checks the `is_import` attribute when comparing lines.
