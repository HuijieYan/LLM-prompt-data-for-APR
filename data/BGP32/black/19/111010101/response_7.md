## Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function should return a tuple containing the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
3. The buggy function has several issues:
    - It does not correctly update the `before` variable in certain conditions.
    - The condition for checking if a line is an import (`current_line.is_import`) is incorrect as this should be checked using the `is_import` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly in all conditions. The condition for checking if a line is an import should be fixed to use the `is_import` function.
5. Let's correct the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

# Define the Leaf and Line classes for illustration
class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type_, value):
        self.type = type_
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.is_decorator = False
        self.is_def = False
        self.is_class = False
        self.is_flow_control = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.is_yield = False

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import()
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By updating the conditions and calling the `is_import` function to check if a line is an import, we can fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
