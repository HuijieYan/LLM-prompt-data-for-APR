### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function contains a bug where it incorrectly handles the cases related to inserting empty lines depending on certain conditions. 

### Issues
1. The function incorrectly handles the scenario for adding empty lines before the first line in the file.
2. It does not adequately handle the case where empty lines should not be inserted between decorators.
3. Incorrect logic for determining newlines to be inserted based on conditions related to the current line and the previous line.

### Bug Causes
The main issue stems from the incorrect handling of various conditions for inserting empty lines. This results in the function not returning the expected number of empty lines in different scenarios, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in different scenarios needs to be corrected. Ensuring that the function adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the test cases will resolve the bug.

### Updated Code
Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified and should now return the expected number of empty lines in different scenarios as per the test cases.
