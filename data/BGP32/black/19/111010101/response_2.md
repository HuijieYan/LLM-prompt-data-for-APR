### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class expects a `Line` object as input and calculates the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function manipulates the prefix attribute of the first leaf in the current line and uses several conditions to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect comparison conditions for determining whether to insert empty lines or not based on the type of the current line and the previous line. The issue is specifically with how the conditions involving `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `depth` are handled.
4. To fix the bug, the comparison conditions need to be adjusted to correctly evaluate the type of the current line and the previous line.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the comparison condition for checking if the current line is an import statement by accessing the `is_import` function from the imported module.
2. Adjust the conditions related to `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` so that the correct number of empty lines is returned.
3. Make sure to update the function based on the expected behavior described in the test cases.

### Code Fix:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
