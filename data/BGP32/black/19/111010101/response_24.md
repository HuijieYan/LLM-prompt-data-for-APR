### Analysis:
- The `max_allowed` variable is used to determine the maximum number of possible empty lines before the current line.
- The function tries to adjust the number of empty lines based on different conditions like whether the current line is a decorator, def, class, flow control, import, or yield.
- There are conditions to handle different scenarios for adding empty lines before and after the current line.
- The issue seems to be with how the variable `before` is updated and used during the execution of the function, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Causes of the Bug:
- The bug seems to be in the updating of the `before` variable where it is set to `1` or `2` based on conditions in the function. This causes the function to possibly return incorrect values for empty lines.
- The function has complex condition checks that might not be properly updating the variables `before` and `newlines` leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
- Review the conditions updating the `before` variable to ensure that it correctly adjusts the number of empty lines needed before the current line.
- Check the condition checks and their corresponding actions to determine if they are correctly handling the scenarios for empty lines.
- Ensure that the function returns the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions specified.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring the correct update of the `before` variable and correctly handling the conditions for the number of empty lines, the corrected function should now return the expected values for the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
