### Analysis
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function uses various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` object and some attributes of the class instance to determine the number of empty lines.
- The bug arises from the usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` in an incorrect way. The function is trying to access a method `is_import` on the `previous_line` object but does not account for the fact that the method is defined in a different function. This leads to the comparison failing and returning an incorrect number of empty lines.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of `self.previous_line.is_import` in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where `is_import` is not a direct property of `previous_line` but is a function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` defined in the same `black.py` file.
- Since `is_import` is not an attribute of `Line`, it is not directly accessible from the `previous_line` object, leading to a comparison error and incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy
- We should utilize the `is_import` function defined in the same file to check if a line represents an import statement instead of directly accessing `self.previous_line.is_import`.
- By using the `is_import` function properly, we can determine if a line is an import without relying on incorrect attribute access.

### Updated Function with Fix
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(current_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By utilizing the `is_import` function for proper comparison, we have fixed the bug causing incorrect behavior in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This updated version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected number of empty lines based on the input line.
