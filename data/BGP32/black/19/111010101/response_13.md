### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method defined in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function tries to determine the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions and the history of previous lines.
3. The function contains several conditionals based on properties of the `current_line` and `previous_line`.
4. The error occurs because the function attempts to access `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield`, which are not attributes of the `Line` class. Instead, there is a function `is_import` in the same file that should be called.
5. To fix the bug, we need to replace the incorrect attribute accesses with the function call `is_import`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Replace the incorrect attribute accesses `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` with a function call `is_import`.
2. Update the conditional checks accordingly to utilize the correct function call to check if `current_line` or `previous_line` is an import or a yield.
3. Handle the cases involving imports and yields correctly to determine the number of empty lines needed appropriately.

### Bug Fix
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By replacing the incorrect attribute accesses with the `is_import` function call, the function should now handle the cases involving imports and yields correctly and pass the failing test cases.
