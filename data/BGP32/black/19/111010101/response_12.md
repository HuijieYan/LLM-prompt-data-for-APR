### Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function utilizes various conditions based on the properties of the `Line` object passed as a parameter.

The error message indicates a failing test related to the formatting of comments within decorators. The test expects a certain format of empty lines before and after the comments in decorators but receives a different format.

### Identified Bugs
1. The function checks for `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function defined in the same file.
2. The function incorrectly sets the number of empty lines before returning in certain conditions leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the comparison with `self.previous_line.is_import` by using the `is_import` function.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly calculate the number of empty lines before returning based on the conditions.

### Updated Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the comparison with `self.previous_line.is_import` and adjusting the logic for determining empty lines, the function should now provide the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
