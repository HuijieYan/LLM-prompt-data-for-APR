### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. The function checks various properties of the `current_line` object and previous lines to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

There are several issues in the function:
1. Incorrect checking of the condition for decorators, definitions, and classes to determine the number of empty lines.
2. Incorrect reference to the `is_import` attribute of `current_line` directly, should use the `is_import` function instead.
3. The logic in the function does not match the expected behavior based on the provided test cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from incorrect condition evaluations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, leading to incorrect computation of the number of empty lines required in specific scenarios. Additionally, directly checking the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` object instead of using the `is_import` function can cause unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug:
1. Correct the condition evaluations for decorators, definitions, classes, flow controls, imports, and yields to accurately determine the number of empty lines.
2. Replace the direct reference to `current_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function.
3. Ensure that the flow of the function aligns with the expected behavior based on the provided test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the condition evaluations based on the expected behavior and uses the `is_import` function appropriately. It should now pass the failing test cases and correctly compute the number of empty lines needed.
