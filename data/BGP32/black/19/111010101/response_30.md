### Analysis
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function uses various conditions based on the attributes of the `current_line` object to determine the number of empty lines.
- There is a condition that checks if the `current_line` object is an import by calling the `is_import` function. However, the `is_import` function doesn't exist in the provided code, which causes an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `is_import` attribute on `self.previous_line`.
- The error message indicates an issue where empty lines are not correctly handled in the function, leading to a failed test case related to comments within decorators.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs because the `is_import` function is missing, causing an error when trying to access it as an attribute in the condition checking for imports.
- The absence of the `is_import` function leads to incorrect logic in handling the flow control, imports, and yields conditions within the function, causing incorrect output in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Implement the `is_import` function that can properly determine if a line is an import or not.
- Ensure the conditions within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function are properly aligned with the expected logic for handling different types of lines and scenarios based on the `current_line` attributes.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# Assume the implementation of Leaf and Line classes here

# Define the is_import function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Implement the logic to determine if a leaf is an import
    pass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line = None
    previous_after = 0
    previous_defs = []

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By implementing the `is_import` function and adjusting the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to include this check and align with the expected behavior for handling different types of lines, the bug should be fixed, and the function should return the correct number of empty lines based on the specified conditions.
