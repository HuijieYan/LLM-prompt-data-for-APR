### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions such as line properties, previous line properties, etc. 

The bug occurs when checking if the `current_line` is an import statement (`current_line.is_import`). The function wrongly tries to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `current_line`, but in the context of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, this attribute is not present directly on `current_line`. Instead, the intention is to use the function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`, provided separately, to determine this property.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function attempts to access the `is_import` attribute on the `current_line` object, but this attribute is not defined in the `Line` class itself. The code should be using the `is_import` function defined outside the class.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the section where `current_line.is_import` is used to call the `is_import` external function.
2. Update the parameters passed to `is_import` to match the expected values.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using the `is_import` function correctly when checking for import statements, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
