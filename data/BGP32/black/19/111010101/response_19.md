### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions related to the input `current_line` and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object. The bug arises from the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` within the function. 

The error messages indicate that the expected and actual outputs don't match because the function is not handling the situation correctly when determining the number of empty lines before and after a line that is not considered an import but is following a line that was considered an import.

### Bug Location
The buggy condition in the function causing the issue is:

```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0
```

The problem arises when `self.previous_line` is considered an import, but `current_line` is not an import. This condition is leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted.

### Bug Cause
The bug is mainly caused by the misinterpretation of the condition that checks if there was an import in the `self.previous_line`. The function incorrectly inserts empty lines based on this condition when transitioning from import lines to non-import lines.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how empty lines are determined based on the presence of import lines in the `self.previous_line` and the current line. We need to refactor the condition that compares the import status of the previous line to correctly handle the case when the previous line was an import, but the current line is not.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This correction will properly handle the case where the previous line was considered an import, but the current line is not, ensuring the correct number of empty lines are inserted in the returned tuple.
