### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison between `self.previous_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_import`.
4. The function uses instance variables like `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line` to determine the number of empty lines needed.
5. The failing test shows a mismatch in the output expected and actual values, hinting at a bug in the logic of the function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when checking for the presence of `self.previous_line.is_import`. The function tries to access the attribute `is_import` directly on `self.previous_line`, assuming it's a function attribute. However, `is_import` is actually a function defined in the same file and not an attribute of the `Line` class. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function with the appropriate argument.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the fix applied:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call the is_import function
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)`, we ensure that the correct function is called to check for the condition. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
