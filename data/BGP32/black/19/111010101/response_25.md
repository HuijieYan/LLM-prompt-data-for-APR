### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that determines the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on specific conditions related to indentation, line types, and previous lines.
2. The buggy function is trying to handle these conditions but is encountering an error due to incorrect checks and assignments.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between an expected string with additional empty lines and the actual output, suggesting that the function is not correctly handling empty lines.
4. To fix the bug, we need to carefully evaluate the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure it correctly handles all the conditions described in the `Expected case` scenarios.
5. Based on the scenarios, the bug primarily lies in how the function handles preceding and following empty lines with respect to different line types and conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure to correctly handle the number of allowed empty lines before and after the current line based on the line type and surrounding context.
2. Implement proper checks for decorator lines, import lines, yield lines, flow control lines, and regular code lines to set the appropriate number of empty lines before and after the current line.
3. Update the logic related to `before` and `newlines` variables to maintain the correct count of empty lines.
4. Use the previous line's information and the previous definitions stack to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.
5. Update the function to match the expected behavior outlined in the `Expected case` scenarios.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and not current_line.is_yield
        or depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    # Default case, return before value as it is
    return before, 0
```

By appropriately handling the conditions in the corrected function above, the logic now aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the `Expected case` scenarios. This corrected function should pass the failing test and produce the expected output for various scenarios.
