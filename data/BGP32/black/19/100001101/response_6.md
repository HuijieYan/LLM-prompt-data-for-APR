The buggy function is intended to handle empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current line of code. However, there are a couple of issues in the function that need to be addressed. 

1. The `max_allowed` variable is set to 1 initially but is reset to 2 when `current_line.depth` is 0. This reset logic seems unnecessary and could be simplified.
2. The logic inside the while loop to adjust the `before` variable seems incorrect.

To address these issues and fix the bug, consider the following corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and should now handle empty lines according to the specified conditions.
