## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines that should be added before the current line based on various conditions. However, there is a logic issue in the function that causes incorrect behavior for some cases.

1. In case 1, when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, the function incorrectly sets `max_allowed = 2`. This causes the function to return `newlines = 2` instead of the expected `newlines = 1`. The max_allowed should only be 2 for cases other than decorators.

2. In case 3, the function correctly sets `max_allowed = 2` when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True` but then sets `newlines = 2` which overwrites the expected value of `newlines = 1`. This results in incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to update the logic for setting `newlines` in cases where `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2  # Updated logic for handling decorators
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for setting `newlines` when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions specified in the function. This fix should address the bug and ensure the correct behavior of the function for all test cases.
