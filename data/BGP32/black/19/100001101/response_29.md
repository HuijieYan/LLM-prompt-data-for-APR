The buggy function is designed to handle the formatting of empty lines within code based on certain conditions. However, there are inconsistencies in the logic of the function that lead to incorrect behavior. The main issue lies in the calculation of the `before` variable and the handling of `max_allowed`. 

Here are the identified problems:
1. Inconsistent handling of `before` variable: The `before` variable is calculated in different branches but is not consistently updated or utilized, leading to incorrect values.
2. Incorrect handling of `max_allowed`: The value of `max_allowed` is set based on specific conditions but is not properly utilized in subsequent calculations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent and correct usage of `before` and `max_allowed` variables based on the conditions provided in the function.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    # Update max_allowed based on current_line.depth
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update before based on previous_defs values
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, `before` and `max_allowed` are appropriately updated and used throughout the function based on the specified conditions to ensure correct behavior.
