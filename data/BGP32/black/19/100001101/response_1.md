The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from incorrectly setting the `before` variable inside the while loop. The function is supposed to handle different cases based on the type of the current line and previous line, determining the number of empty lines to insert. However, in the while loop, the `before` variable is being incorrectly updated to 1 if `depth` is not 0, which is causing incorrect behavior in subsequent return statements.

To fix this bug, the while loop logic needs to be adjusted to properly update the `before` variable based on conditions related to the `depth` and previous definitions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the different cases and provide the expected output based on the input parameters provided in each case.
