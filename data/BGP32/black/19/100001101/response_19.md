## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to incorrect handling of the `before` variable when processing different cases. The issue arises when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a specific line. The algorithm doesn't properly consider the `before` variable's value and can result in incorrect insertion of empty lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the `before` variable is calculated and applied when determining the number of empty lines to insert. We should ensure that the `before` value is correctly updated based on the conditions in the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the logic to correctly handle the `before` variable based on the conditions within the function. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before each line as expected.
