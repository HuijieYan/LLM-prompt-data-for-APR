## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the logic of determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the current line's properties and context. The function is expected to return a tuple of two integers: the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

However, the function has a bug that affects the calculation of the number of empty lines before the current line. The issue arises when handling cases where previous lines are decorators or imports. In these cases, the function incorrectly sets the `before` variable to 1 if the depth is zero, which results in an inconsistent calculation of the number of empty lines before the current line.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we should adjust the handling of cases involving decorators and imports. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is calculated correctly based on the conditions provided in the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the incorrect assignment of the `before` variable in the conditions involving decorators and imports, the corrected version of the function should now handle empty line insertion correctly based on the given conditions and expected behavior.
