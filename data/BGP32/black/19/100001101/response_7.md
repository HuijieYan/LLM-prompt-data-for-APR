## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle cases where empty lines should be inserted based on certain conditions related to the current line and the previous line. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior when the function is executed.

1. The variable `before` is being reassigned within the while loop, which does not consider the original value of `before`. This results in incorrect empty line handling based on the depth.
2. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert is convoluted and not handling the different cases correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following strategies can be employed:
1. Ensure that `before` retains its value after updates within the while loop instead of being reassigned.
2. Simplify the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert based on the conditions specified.

## Bug Fix: Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = min(before, 2)  # Update based on depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now properly handles the conditions and ensures that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the defined rules.
