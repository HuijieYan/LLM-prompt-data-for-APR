The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines. The function is designed to determine the number of empty lines to add before a current line based on certain conditions. However, in some cases, the logic for handling empty lines and decorators might be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

Based on the provided buggy function and the runtime input/output values, here is a summary of the identified issues and potential fixes:

1. In cases where `current_line.is_decorator` is True, the logic for handling empty lines and decorators might be incorrect. This could lead to inserting empty lines where they are not needed.

2. The manipulation of the `before` variable within the while loop might not account for the correct number of empty lines to be added.

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revise the logic for handling decorators, empty lines, and the calculation of the number of empty lines to be added.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to decorators and the calculation of empty lines. It ensures that empty lines are added according to the expected behavior based on the input parameters and the runtime values.

Please test the corrected version of the function with the provided test cases to verify if it now produces the expected output for each scenario.
