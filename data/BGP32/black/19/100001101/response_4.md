Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime and expected values, the bug arises from incorrect logic around handling empty lines. The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. The issue seems to be with the calculation of the `before` variable in different scenarios, leading to incorrect behavior. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly calculated based on the conditions provided in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

In this corrected version, the calculation of the `before` variable has been adjusted to ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior in different scenarios. This should address the bug and make the function correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on the defined conditions.
