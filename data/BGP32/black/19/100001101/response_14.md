The buggy function is designed to handle empty lines according to specific conditions related to the current line's attributes. However, there seem to be some issues with the condition checks and the handling of empty lines. The main problem occurs when dealing with the `before` variable, which determines how many empty lines should be inserted before the current line.

Based on the failing test cases and their expected results, the key issues in the function are:

1. Incorrect handling of `before` variable assignment within the while loop when updating the `previous_defs` list.
2. Incorrect calculation of the number of newlines to be inserted based on the line attributes.

To resolve the issues, the following corrections can be made to the function:

1. Modify the assignment of the `before` variable within the while loop to consider the depth of the current line properly.
2. Adjust the logic for calculating the number of newlines based on the line attributes to align with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected function now properly handles the insertion of empty lines based on the given conditions and should satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases provided.
