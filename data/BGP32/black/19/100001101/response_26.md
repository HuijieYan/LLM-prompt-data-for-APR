The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the conditions and logic used to determine the number of empty lines to return. The algorithm to decide on the number of empty lines contains multiple conditions that might lead to incorrect deductions when analyzing different types of lines.

To amend the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the conditions based on different line types and their relationship with the previous line. By analyzing the runtime and expected values provided, it appears that the implementation needs to consider various scenarios, such as decorators, imports, flow control, yield statements, classes, and functions, to make correct decisions on inserting empty lines.

A strategy to fix this bug involves:
1. Reviewing the logic for determining the number of empty lines before returning.
2. Revising the conditions for different line types to ensure accurate calculations.
3. Adjusting the return values based on the specific context of the current line and its relationship with the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function aims to address the issues observed in the buggy function by accurately handling different line types and their specific conditions to determine the appropriate number of empty lines before the current line.
