The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a flaw that causes incorrect handling of empty lines in certain cases, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect output. The main issue arises from the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.

Here is an analysis of the buggy function based on the provided runtime and expected input/output values:

- In Case 1, the current line is a decorator, which should trigger the addition of two newlines. However, the function incorrectly returns `(2, 0)`. This discrepancy is due to the mishandling of the `is_decorator` condition.

To address the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling decorators to correctly determine the number of empty lines to be added before the current line.
2. Ensure that the conditions for the various cases, such as flow control, imports, and yields, are properly accounted for in calculating the empty lines.

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now accurately calculate and return the correct number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on the provided input and expected output values.
