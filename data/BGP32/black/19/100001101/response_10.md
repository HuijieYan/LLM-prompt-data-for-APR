The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted based on certain conditions of the input `current_line`. However, the function has a bug that causes it to return incorrect values in some cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function tries to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. In the first condition `if current_line.leaves:`, it attempts to process the prefixes of the leaves within `current_line`, but it goes wrong when determining the `before` value.

In the faulty code:
```python
if current_line.leaves:
    # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
    before = min(before, max_allowed)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""
```

There is a logical error in how `before` is calculated based on the count of newlines in the `prefix` of the `first_leaf`. In some cases, this logic leads to incorrect newline count and unexpectedly truncates the `prefix`.

### Fix Strategy:
To correct the bug, a more appropriate way to calculate the number of newlines before the current line should be considered. This requires ensuring that the logic for handling `before` is carefully reviewed and modified if necessary.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the logic that calculates the number of newlines before the current line, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the cases defined by the input parameters and return the expected values.
