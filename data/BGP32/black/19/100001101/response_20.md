The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be due to incorrect handling of the `before` variable. The `before` variable is being mutated within the loop without proper consideration of its initial state. This leads to unexpected behaviors such as setting `before` to specific values without keeping track of its original value.

To fix this bug, we should store the initial value of `before` and only update it under specific conditions, ensuring that it does not lose its original value inadvertently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0  # Initial value of before
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        if before > max_allowed:
            before = max_allowed
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    initial_before = before  # Store the initial value of before
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return initial_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (initial_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (initial_before or 1), 0

    return initial_before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the `before` variable is preserved with its initial value stored in `initial_before`, ensuring that updates to `before` do not inadvertently change its value beyond the intended conditions. This should address the issue with the function and provide the expected output for all test cases.
