The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines before certain types of code blocks. Based on the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, it appears that the function is not correctly determining the number of required empty lines in some scenarios.

The bug seems to be primarily related to the calculation of the `newlines` variable. In several cases, the function returns `(newlines, 0)` where `newlines` is set to a value of 2 without properly subtracting based on certain conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the `newlines` variable based on the conditions provided in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth != 0 else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the logic for calculating the number of required empty lines before different types of code blocks based on the provided conditions.
