## Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The bug in the function lies in the condition where it checks if `self.previous_line.is_import` to determine if the previous line was an import statement. The problem is that it tries to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line`, which is not correct since the `is_import` function is defined outside of the class.
3. The error occurs because `self.previous_line` is not an instance of a class that has an `is_import` attribute, and thus the condition will always fail, leading to incorrect output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as an argument to determine if the previous line was an import statement.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function to check if it's an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the change to call the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument, we can accurately determine whether the previous line was an import statement and fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
