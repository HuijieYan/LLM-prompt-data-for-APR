## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function aims to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions and properties of the `current_line`, as well as the previous line.
3. There are several potential error locations in the function:
   - The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` checks if the `previous_line` has an `is_import` attribute. However, there is no attribute `is_import` defined in the `Line` class, which could lead to an AttributeError.
   - The correctness of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function depends on the accurate identification of line types and properties.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions and attributes accessed in the function are correct and consistent with the definitions in the related classes.
5. One possible strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the condition checking for `is_import` to reflect the appropriate attribute defined in the `Line` class.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I replaced the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` with `hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import') and self.previous_line.is_import` to avoid the AttributeError and ensure consistent attribute access.
