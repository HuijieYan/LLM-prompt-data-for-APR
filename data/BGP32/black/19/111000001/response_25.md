## Analyzing the buggy function and related components:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class is a dataclass that provides a method `_maybe_empty_lines` which determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes a parameter `current_line` of type `Line`, but the definition of the `Line` class is not provided in the code snippet.
- Inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, there are conditional checks based on the properties of the `current_line` object and some internal state variables like `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, etc.
- The main bug in the function seems to be with the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`. This is incorrect because `is_import` is a function, not a property of `self.previous_line`.
- The `is_import` function is defined outside of the `EmptyLineTracker` class but is used as if it were a property of the class instance.
- This is likely causing an AttributeError due to trying to access `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to correctly call the `is_import` function by passing the appropriate parameter to check if the `previous_line` is an import line.
- The fix involves changing `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly determine if the `previous_line` represents an import line.

## Corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

By making the mentioned correction and calling the `is_import` function correctly, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be fixed.
