### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines()` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function relies on various conditions related to the `current_line` being processed, the previous line (`self.previous_line`), and other attributes like `depth`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.
3. The bug in the function is related to the check for `is_import` in the condition block which is incorrect as `is_import` is a function and not a property of the `current_line`.
4. The bug can be fixed by calling the `is_import()` function with the appropriate leaf from the `current_line.leaves` list to determine if it's an import line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Get the first leaf from `current_line.leaves` list.
2. Check if the first leaf is an import by passing it to the `is_import()` function.
3. Update the logic related to determining extra empty lines based on the correct import check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
    
        is_import = is_import(current_line.leaves[0]) if current_line.leaves else False
    
        if is_import:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line.leaves[0])
            and not is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I introduced `is_import` as a local variable and called the `is_import()` function appropriately to check if the first leaf of the current line is an import. The logic related to handling empty lines before and after the current line has been adjusted accordingly.
