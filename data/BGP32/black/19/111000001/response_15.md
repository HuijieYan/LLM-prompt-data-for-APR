## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is trying to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. However, there are multiple issues in the logic of this function that need to be addressed. 

## Identified Errors:
1. There is a reference to `self.previous_defs`, which is not defined within the class.
2. The condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:` is incorrect because it doesn't cover all cases that need to be considered.
3. The condition `if current_line.is_flow_control:` doesn't handle all possible scenarios correctly.
4. The condition involving `self.previous_line.is_import` is not implemented correctly. It tries to call the `is_import` function directly on `self.previous_line`, which is an instance of `Line` and not a function itself.

## Bug Causes:
1. The undefined `self.previous_defs` attribute leads to an attribute error.
2. Incorrect conditions related to decorators, definitions, classes, and flow control statements, causing incorrect handling of empty lines.
3. Incorrect usage of `is_import` on `self.previous_line` causing the function to not work as intended.

## Strategy:
1. Define `self.previous_defs` as an empty list at the initialization of the class.
2. Modify the conditions related to decorators, definitions, classes, and flow control to handle all cases appropriately.
3. Replace the incorrect usage of `is_import(self.previous_line)` with `self.previous_line.is_import()` to correctly check if the previous line is an import.

## Corrected Version:

    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
