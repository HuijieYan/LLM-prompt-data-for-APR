### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method inside the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. It checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
3. The buggy part lies in the condition where it checks if the `current_line` is an import statement. Instead of calling the `is_import` function correctly, it is trying to access the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` object directly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function with the appropriate argument to determine if the `current_line` is an import statement or not.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function correctly
        and not is_import(current_line)    # Call is_import function correctly
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this fix, I replaced the incorrect access to `current_line.is_import` with the correct function call `is_import(current_line)` to check if the current line is an import statement. This change will prevent the bug of trying to access a nonexistent `is_import` attribute of `current_line`.
