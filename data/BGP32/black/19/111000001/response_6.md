## Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class is defined with the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions such as depth of the current line, presence of leaves, decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields to determine the required number of empty lines.
3. The bug likely lies in the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` which is trying to access the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object. However, the `is_import` function is defined outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class and should not be accessed via an object attribute.
4. The bug can be fixed by correctly calling the `is_import` function from the relevant module where it is defined.

## Bug Fixing Strategy:
1. Modify the buggy line `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly call the `is_import` function from the module where it is defined.
2. Since the `is_import` function takes a `Leaf` object as an argument, ensure that the `current_line` object is passed appropriately when calling `is_import`.

## Corrected Version:

        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:

        return before, 1

        and not current_line.is_import
