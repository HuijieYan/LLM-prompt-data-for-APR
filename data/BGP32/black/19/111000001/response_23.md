The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug related to the comparison of attributes of the previous line and current line objects. The error occurs in the following condition checks:
1. `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import`
2. `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)`

The cause of the bug is that the `self.previous_line` object is not defined or initialized properly, resulting in attribute errors during comparisons. In this case, the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes are trying to be accessed on the `self.previous_line` object that is not guaranteed to exist.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self.previous_line` attribute is correctly set before these comparisons are made. One approach is to set `self.previous_line` to `current_line` at the end of the function after processing the current line. This way, the comparisons with the previous line would involve valid objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            self.previous_line = current_line
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            self.previous_line = current_line
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return (before or 1), 0

    self.previous_line = current_line
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, `self.previous_line` is properly set to `current_line` after processing each line, ensuring that it is available for comparison with the next line. Additionally, we added `hasattr` checks to ensure that the attributes are present before accessing them for comparison.
