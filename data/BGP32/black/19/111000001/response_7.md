## Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. It calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The function relies on some attributes of the `current_line`, `previous_line`, and `previous_defs`.
4. The bug seems to be in the condition where it checks if the `previous_line` is an import or yield.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the code is due to the incorrect check for whether `self.previous_line` is an import or yield. The function tries to call `is_import` and `is_yield` on the `Line` instances, but these methods do not exist in the `Line` class. Instead, it should be calling `is_import` and `is_yield` functions from the module level, as seen in the function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access these attributes on the `Line` instance.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions from the module level, passing the relevant leaf as an argument. This will correctly determine if the current or previous lines are imports or yields.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected: Call module-level function
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Corrected: Call module-level function
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)  # Corrected: Call module-level function
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)  # Corrected: Call module-level function
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `is_import` and `is_yield` functions are called from the module level instead of attempting to access non-existent attributes on the `Line` instances. This fixes the bug and ensures the function works as intended.
