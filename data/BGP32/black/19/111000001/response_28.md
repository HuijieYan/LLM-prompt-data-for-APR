## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function attempts to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.
3. There are a few potential error locations in the function:
   - Incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs` which could lead to unexpected behavior.
   - Incorrect usage of `self.previous_line` which might not be properly initialized.
   - Incorrect comparison of `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` which can cause a bug.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure proper handling of `self.previous_defs` list.
   - Check if `self.previous_line` is properly updated.
   - Make sure to call the `is_import` function correctly for `current_line` and `self.previous_line`.

## Correction:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(current_line)
            and not is_import(self.previous_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

## Correction Rationale:
1. Replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import.
2. Updated the comparison of `current_line.is_yield` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` to check if the current line is not a yield or at a different depth than the previous line.
3. Ensured proper referencing of `is_import` function for line checks involving imports.
4. The corrected version addresses the identified potential error locations and should provide more accurate behavior in calculating empty lines.
