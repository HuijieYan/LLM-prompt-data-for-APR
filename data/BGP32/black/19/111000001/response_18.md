## Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The method accesses instance variables like `previous_defs`, `previous_line`, and also the properties of `current_line`.
3. There are conditional statements in the method that determine the number of empty lines based on the characteristics of the current line and the previous line.
4. The method uses properties like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield` to make decisions regarding the empty lines.

## Bugs and Cause:
1. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the method `is_import` in the conditional check `self.previous_line.is_import`. The method `is_import` should have been called on an instance of a class or imported as a module directly, not as a method.
2. Since `is_import` is meant to be a standalone function, it cannot be invoked as a method of another class instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Since `is_import` is already defined as an independent function outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class, we need to call it directly without using as a method.
2. Instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should call `is_import` on `self.previous_line` to determine if it's an import line.
3. Modify the conditional check to `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import statement.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version, the bug related to the incorrect usage of `is_import` method on `self.previous_line` is fixed by directly calling `is_import(self.previous_line)` to check if the previous line is an import statement.
