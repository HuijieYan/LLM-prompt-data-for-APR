## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. The function makes use of attributes and methods from the same class (`self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`) as well as attributes from the `Line` class (`current_line.depth`, `current_line.leaves`, `current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_def`, `current_line.is_class`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`).

## Bug:
The bug in the current implementation lies in the following block of code:
```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0
```
The bug occurs because the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is checking if the `previous_line` object has a method `is_import` which doesn't exist. Instead, it should be checking if `self.previous_line` is an import line.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the condition that checks for import lines. We should remove the call to `self.previous_line.is_import` and replace it with a direct check if the `self.previous_line` is an import line or not.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and isinstance(self.previous_line, ImportLine)  # Check if the previous line is an import line
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version, we replaced the `self.previous_line.is_import` condition with `isinstance(self.previous_line, ImportLine)` to check if the `self.previous_line` is an import line. This should address the bug and improve the functionality of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
