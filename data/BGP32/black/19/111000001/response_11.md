### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which is a dataclass used to provide a stateful method for determining the number of potential extra empty lines before and after a processed line.
2. The function uses various attributes of the `current_line` parameter and the state stored in the `EmptyLineTracker` instance to make decisions about the number of empty lines to insert.
3. There are conditionals based on the attributes of `current_line`, such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. The function also interacts with attributes like `previous_defs` and `previous_line`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the `current_line.is_import` check. The function attempts to call `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming that there is an `is_import` attribute on the `previous_line` object. However, the `previous_line` object doesn't have an `is_import` attribute directly. Instead, there's a function `is_import(leaf)` that is used to check if a leaf is an import.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should use the `is_import` function to determine if the `previous_line` is an import rather than directly accessing the `is_import` attribute on the `previous_line`. This will ensure that the correct logic is applied for determining the number of empty lines based on whether the `previous_line` was an import or not.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        is_previous_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
        if (
            is_previous_line_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_previous_line_import` variable is used to determine if the `previous_line` is an import by calling the `is_import` function. This ensures that the correct logic is applied for handling cases where the previous line was an import.
