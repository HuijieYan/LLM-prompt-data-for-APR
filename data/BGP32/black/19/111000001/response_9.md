There are multiple potential errors in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. In the condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import`, `self.previous_line` is checked if it has the attribute `is_import`, which is not a valid attribute of the `Line` class. Instead, a function `is_import` from the same file is used to check if a leaf is an import.
2. The function `is_import` is not called correctly within the if condition.
3. The logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line is convoluted and could be simplified.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to replace the incorrect check of `is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function.
2. Simplify the logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before, after = 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            after = 1
        else:
            if self.previous_line:
                if is_import(self.previous_line):
                    before = 1
                elif self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
                    before = 1
        
        self.previous_line = current_line
        return before, after
``` 

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above. It simplifies the logic and correctly calls the `is_import` function to check if the previous line was an import. Additionally, it sets the `self.previous_line` attribute to the current line for future comparisons.
