## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function relies on properties of the `current_line` object and some other attributes of the class such as `previous_defs`, `previous_line`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.
3. There is a logic error in the function where it checks if `current_line` or `previous_line` is an import by directly referencing `is_import` attribute, which should be compared with a function call `is_import(current_line)` instead.
4. To fix this bug, we need to update the function to call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` object to correctly determine if it is an import statement.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the original function arises from incorrectly referencing the `is_import` attribute directly on the `current_line` or `previous_line` object. The `is_import` attribute is actually a function that takes a `Leaf` object as an argument to determine if it's an import statement. This direct reference causes the function to fail when trying to access the `is_import` directly on the line objects.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the function checks if the `current_line` or `previous_line` is an import statement. We should call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` or `previous_line` as an argument instead of accessing the `is_import` attribute directly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I replaced the direct access to `is_import` with a function call `is_import(current_line)` to correctly check if the line is an import statement. This modification should address the bug and make the function work as intended.
