1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function include:
- Incorrect handling of `self.previous_line.is_import` which should be calling the `is_import` function to check if a line is an import.
- Incorrect logic for determining the number of newlines to return based on the conditions.

3. The bug is caused by attempting to access the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line` directly, which should be handled by calling the `is_import` function. This is likely leading to a false condition check when determining the newlines to return.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition related to imports to correctly call the `is_import` function and compare the result. Additionally, we should review the logic for determining the number of newlines to return based on the different conditions.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call the is_import function to check if the previous line is an import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Call the is_import function to check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By calling the `is_import` function correctly and adjusting the logic for determining the number of newlines to return based on the conditions, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be fixed.
