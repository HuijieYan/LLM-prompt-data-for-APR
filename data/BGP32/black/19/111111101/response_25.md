### Strategy for fixing the bug
After analyzing the buggy function and failing test cases, it is evident that the main issue lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. Specifically, the handling of empty lines before and after decorators, imports, and yield statements seems to be incorrect, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle these cases. We should ensure that the appropriate number of empty lines is added based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling decorators, imports, and yield statements has been updated to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

This updated logic should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output for each scenario.
