The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to how empty lines are handled before and after certain lines. The function is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. 

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, the issue arises when determining the number of empty lines required in specific scenarios like decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields. 

The bug occurs when the condition to check if the current line is an import is incorrectly written. The function checks `self.previous_line.is_import`, but it should check `is_import(self.previous_line)` since `is_import` is the external helper function defined in the same file.

To fix this bug, the condition checking for imports needs to call the `is_import` function correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By properly calling the `is_import` function, the corrected version should now handle the import condition correctly and pass the failing test cases.
