To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the issue where the `is_import` function is called incorrectly. In the buggy function, `current_line.is_import` is being accessed as an attribute, but it needs to be properly checked using the `is_import` function as defined in the same file. This issue causes the failing test to produce unexpected output due to incorrect handling of import-related conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

# Assume the definitions of Line, Leaf, and EmptyLineTracker classes are imported

def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By replacing the incorrect `current_line.is_import` check with a call to the `is_import` function as intended, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
