Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug seems to be in the comparison `current_line.is_import` inside the function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The issue arises from trying to access the attribute `is_import` directly on the `current_line` object, which is not correctly implemented.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison condition to call the helper function `is_import` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class instead of directly accessing the attribute. This ensures that the correct method is called when checking if the current line is an import line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

# Assume the Line and Leaf classes are defined somewhere else
class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.is_decorator = False  # Placeholder for testing
        self.is_def = False
        self.is_class = False
        self.is_flow_control = False
        self.is_import = False
        self.is_yield = False

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, leaf_type, value):
        self.leaf_type = leaf_type
        self.value = value
        self.prefix = ""

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
        # Assume implementation here
        pass

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0])  # Corrected comparison
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

With this modification, the function now calls the `is_import` method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class to correctly check if the first leaf of the previous line is an import, addressing the bug identified in the failing test cases. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests by comparing import lines properly.
