### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where it incorrectly handles the logic related to calculating the number of empty lines before and after a line. The function is designed to handle different cases based on the type of the current line, such as decorators, classes, flow control, imports, and yields. However, there are issues in the logic flow leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines in several scenarios.

1. In the case of decorators, the function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines based on the previous line's properties and the current line's depth.
2. In the case of imports and yields, the function does not correctly account for the conditions to determine the number of empty lines.
3. The logic for handling flow control also needs correction to ensure the appropriate number of empty lines is inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revise the logic for handling decorators, imports, yields, and flow control to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the current and previous line properties. Additionally, we need to handle the scenarios of class and def declarations correctly to maintain the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import() and not current_line.is_import() and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield() and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the if conditions and handling the cases of decorators, imports, yields, and flow control properly, the updated function will calculate the correct number of empty lines before and after each line, ensuring that the failing test is successful and the expected output is achieved.
