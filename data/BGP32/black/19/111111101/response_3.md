### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the comparison logic for determining empty lines before and after a line of code. In several cases, the function incorrectly sets the number of empty lines due to incorrect conditions and comparisons, which leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

1. In the case where the current line is a decorator, class or function definition, the function should add empty lines based on specific conditions. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the logic for these cases.

2. The function fails to correctly handle the scenario where the previous line is an import statement and the current line is not, leading to incorrect computation of empty lines.

3. Similarly, when the previous line was a yield statement and the current line is not a yield at the same depth, the function is setting the number of empty lines incorrectly.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the conditions need to be adjusted to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after a line of code based on the context of the current and previous lines. The cases where the function is not behaving as expected should be revised to ensure the correct output is generated.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the `EmptyLineTracker` class should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, resolving the bug that caused the failing test cases.
