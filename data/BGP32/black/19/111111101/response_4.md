### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the conditions related to `is_import`, `is_yield`, and empty lines needed before the current line. The issue arises when determining whether to insert empty lines based on the current line properties and the previous line properties.

- In case 1, the buggy function fails to handle the condition related to `current_line.is_import`. This causes the function to return incorrect values, leading to failing tests.
- In cases 2, 3, and 4, similar issues arise when handling `is_import` or `is_yield`, resulting in incorrect empty lines before or after the current line.
- Case 5 reveals an issue with the `is_import` condition similar to the earlier cases.
- Case 6 shows how the function incorrectly determines the number of empty lines based on the current line properties.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the buggy behavior, the function needs to correctly handle the conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield`. This involves accurately checking the properties of the current line and the previous line to determine if empty lines need to be inserted before or after the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
In the corrected version, the function properly handles the conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield`, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before and after the current line based on the line properties. This should address the failing tests and produce the expected output.
