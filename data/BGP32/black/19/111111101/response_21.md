## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs because the condition `and self.previous_line.is_import` is checking if a method `is_import` exists on the `previous_line` object. However, `is_import` is a standalone function, not a method of the `Line` class.

The error message indicates a comparison between lines with and without additional empty lines, resulting in an incorrect assertion failure due to incorrect handling of empty lines before the decorated lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly call the standalone function `is_import`, passing `self.previous_line` as an argument.
2. Update the condition to handle the case where the current line is not an import but the previous line is.
3. Adjust the logic to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines depending on the context of the current and previous lines.

## The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By replacing the incorrect call to `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)`, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
