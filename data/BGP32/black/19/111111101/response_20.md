### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the logic related to determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. There is an issue with how the function is storing and updating the `previous_defs` list which leads to incorrect results in specific scenarios.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function checks various conditions related to the characteristics of the current line such as whether it is a decorator, a flow control statement, an import line, etc. Based on these conditions, it calculates the number of empty lines to insert before and after the line.
2. The issue arises when handling the `self.previous_defs` list. In certain cases, such as function definitions or class definitions, the function incorrectly updates the `previous_defs` list which affects the calculation of empty lines.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `previous_defs` list is updated and used in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. We need to ensure that the correct previous depth is recorded for later reference.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the way `is_import` is called and correctly handling the `previous_defs`, the corrected code should now provide the expected number of empty lines before and after the line, passing the failing test cases.
