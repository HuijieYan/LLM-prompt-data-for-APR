## Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the logic related to empty lines. In the case where it needs to compute the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line, it fails to accurately determine the correct number in certain scenarios. 

The problematic part of the code lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line. The issues arise when evaluating conditions related to decorators, imports, yield, and flow control. The `self.previous_line.is_import` check inside the function is incorrect due to the wrong usage of the `is_import` function which should be accessed as `is_import(current_line)`. In addition, the way the previous_def stack is updated and used to determine the number of empty lines is causing unexpected results.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Fix the error in the condition checking for `current_line.is_import` by accessing it correctly.
2. Update the logic for maintaining and using the `self.previous_defs` stack to correctly handle nested structures and determine the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the depth of the line and various conditions.

## Code Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the conditions related to imports, yield, and maintaining the correct number of previous definitions, the function will accurately determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This should address the issues causing the failing tests.
