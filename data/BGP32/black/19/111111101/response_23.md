The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises due to incorrect handling of the conditions related to empty lines. The function fails to correctly set the number of newlines required before and after the currently processed line. 

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly calculate the number of empty lines needed based on the context of the input line. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if not current_line.leaves:
        before = 0
    else:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    newlines = 0
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        newlines = 1

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        newlines = before or 1

    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        newlines = before or 1

    return newlines, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the proper number of empty lines is calculated based on the various conditions provided in the function.

By using this corrected version, the failing test should pass successfully, and the expected input/output values for all cases should be satisfied.
