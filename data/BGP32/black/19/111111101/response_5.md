### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to incorrect handling when checking if a line is an import. The buggy function incorrectly checks `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function defined outside the class to determine if the previous line is an import, leading to incorrect results and assertion failures in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should call the `is_import` function defined outside the class to correctly check if the previous line is an import. This will ensure that the proper logic for checking imports is used and that the function behaves as intended.

### The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function here
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this modification, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function will correctly use the `is_import` function to check if the previous line is an import, fixing the bug and ensuring the function behaves as expected.
