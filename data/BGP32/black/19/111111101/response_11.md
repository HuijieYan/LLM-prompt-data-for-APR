### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect checks and updates related to the handling of previous definitions and decorators. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is flawed, leading to incorrect spacing in the output.

1. The function wrongly handles the case where the current line is a decorator or a definition. It fails to handle the situation where the current line is a decorator and the previous line is also a decorator, resulting in incorrect empty line counts.

2. In the case where the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import, the function incorrectly adjusts the number of empty lines by considering the previous line's depth to match the current line's depth, leading to incorrect spacing.

3. There is also an issue with the handling of previous definitions in the `self.previous_defs` list. The function pops entries from this list inappropriately, and it does not account for the correct number of empty lines before and after lines involving definitions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following corrections are necessary:
1. Update the logic for handling decorators to ensure correct counting of empty lines before decorators and to skip inserting empty lines between consecutive decorators.

2. Adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines when transitioning from import lines to non-import lines, taking into account the depths of the lines.

3. Fix the management of the `self.previous_defs` list to correctly track previous definitions and adjust the number of empty lines accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the extra newlines of the first leaf
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues and should now correctly handle the spacing requirements based on the conditions specified.
