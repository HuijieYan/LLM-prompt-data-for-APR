### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The issue seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after a line in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. The function should correctly handle cases related to decorators, imports, yields, and other conditions to calculate the appropriate number of empty lines.
3. It seems that the logic for handling previous definitions and decorators might be causing incorrect results.
4. The function should accurately consider the current line's properties and the previous line's properties to decide on the number of empty lines needed.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    # corrected version of the buggy function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]

            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[-1])
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues with calculating the correct number of empty lines before and after a given line, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for the failing test cases.
