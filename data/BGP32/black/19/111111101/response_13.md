### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the comparison between the `previous_line` attribute of the `self` object and the `current_line` attributes such as `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `depth`. The buggy code incorrectly checks for conditions based on `is_import` and `is_yield` directly on the `previous_line` attribute without considering whether those attributes exist in the `current_line`. This leads to incorrect evaluation of whether to insert empty lines before the current line or not, causing the formatting mismatch and assertion failure in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditions in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to consider the existence of the attributes `is_import` and `is_yield` in the `current_line`. This ensures that the appropriate comparison is made between the attributes of the current and previous lines to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import') and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield') and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected function now properly handles the comparison between the attributes of the current and previous lines, ensuring correct insertion of empty lines based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function.
