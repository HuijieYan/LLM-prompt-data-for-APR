### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly handling the conditions related to whether the current line is an import statement, a yield statement, or certain flow control aspects. The function fails to properly anticipate the scenarios where empty lines should be inserted based on the previous line's properties.

1. If the previous line is an import statement and the current line is not, an empty line should be inserted before the current line.
2. If the previous line was a yield statement but the current line is not a yield statement at the same depth level, an empty line should be inserted before the current line.
3. Empty lines should be inserted correctly based on the depth and the type of the current line.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to correct the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the previous line's properties. We should ensure that the function correctly handles the cases identified above where empty lines need to be inserted before the current line.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before + 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before + 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the different scenarios related to inserting empty lines before and after the current line based on the properties of the current and previous lines.
