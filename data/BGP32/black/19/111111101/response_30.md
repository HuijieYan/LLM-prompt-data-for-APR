The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect check for the attribute `is_import` on `self.previous_line` and `current_line` instances.

Explanation of Bug:
1. The function is failing the test because it fails to handle the case where `self.previous_line` has the attribute `is_import`, leading to the incorrect insertion of extra lines.
2. The buggy section is in the final return statements that check for the `is_import` attribute on `self.previous_line` and `current_line`.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the correct attribute `is_import` on `self.previous_line` and `current_line`.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the case where `self.previous_line` has `is_import` and `current_line` doesnâ€™t or when their depths don't match.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and getattr(self.previous_line, "is_import", False)  # Check if is_import attribute exists
        and not getattr(current_line, "is_import", False)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected function will now correctly handle the cases where `self.previous_line` has the `is_import` attribute, ensuring that the test case passes with the expected input/output values.
