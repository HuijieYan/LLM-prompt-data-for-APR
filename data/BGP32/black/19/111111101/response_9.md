### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines()`. In the failing test, the current line has the comment `'# TODO: Y'` and the previous line has the comment `'# TODO: X'`. The function incorrectly identifies the previous line as an import statement due to the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import`, triggering an incorrect logic branch, leading to unexpected output and causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison condition involving `self.previous_line.is_import` to ensure it checks the correct attributes for import-related logic.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where the previous line is not an import statement to generate the appropriate number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the necessary adjustments to the comparison involving `self.previous_line.is_import` and adding a call to the `is_import` function to correctly identify import statements, the corrected version of the function should now handle the cases properly and pass the failing test.
