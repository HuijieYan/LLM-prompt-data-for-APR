## Bug in the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have an issue in the logic that handles inserting empty lines in the code. The function calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on various conditions such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc. The bug is causing some of the test cases to fail, resulting in incorrect empty line placements in the code.

Looking at the runtime values and the expected values of the variables, particularly the ones directly before the function's return, it seems that the calculation of `newlines` is incorrect for certain cases. The function is supposed to return the number of required newlines before and after the current line, but the calculation logic is flawed.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. The core calculation logic in the function needs to be revised to correctly determine the number of newlines based on the conditions provided.
2. The placement of empty lines should be handled accurately based on the different scenarios like decorators, imports, yields, flow control, etc.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that should address the issue and pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The calculation of `newlines` for decorators and line depth conditions has been fixed.
- Proper handling of imports and yields conditions have been included.
- Use of the `is_import` function to check if a line is an import has been added.

This corrected version should address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and pass the failing test cases.
