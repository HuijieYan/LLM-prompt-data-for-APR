## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from an incorrect comparison between methods `is_import` and `current_line.is_import`. The function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` is not being correctly invoked to determine if the current line is an import. The incorrect comparison causes the function to return an inaccurate number of blank lines based on the conditions provided.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_import` method correctly and compare its return value with the appropriate conditions in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_current_line_import = is_import(current_line) # Correctly determine if current line is an import
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not is_current_line_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By calling `is_import(current_line)`, we accurately determine if the current line is an import and can make the proper comparison to fix the bug in the function.
