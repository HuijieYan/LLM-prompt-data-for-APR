### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from a misunderstanding of how the function handles the logic of inserting empty lines. The function is designed to determine whether empty lines need to be inserted based on various conditions such as the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, class, etc. However, in some cases, the logic implemented in the function does not match the expected behavior, leading to incorrect decisions about inserting empty lines.

Specifically, the issue arises when handling decorators. The function incorrectly checks the current line's `is_decorator` attribute to determine whether to insert empty lines or not. The original implementation does not properly handle situations where the current line is a decorator but the previous line is also a decorator. This results in incorrect decisions being made about inserting empty lines, leading to discrepancies in the output format.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the logic for handling decorators needs to be corrected to ensure that the function handles the scenario where both the previous and current lines are decorators properly. This correction should align with the expected behavior of the function as specified by the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic related to decorators and fixing the `is_import` check by calling the `is_import` function, the corrected version of the function should now satisfy the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
