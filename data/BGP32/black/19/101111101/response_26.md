The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of empty lines based on the depth of the current line. Here's the analysis of the buggy code:

1. The function is supposed to return the number of newlines to insert before the current line and whether to add an empty line after the current line. The issue appears to be with the logic for calculating the number of newlines to insert.
   
2. The bug causes the output to sometimes add fewer or extra newlines than required based on the condition checks.
   
3. In the failing test case, the error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs related to newlines in decorators.

To fix the bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the number of newlines to insert. We need to ensure that the conditions are properly evaluated and the correct number of newlines is returned based on the requirements.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    newlines_before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            return max(1, max_allowed), 0
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_class or current_line.is_def:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max_allowed, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, max_allowed), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, max_allowed), 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for calculating the number of newlines based on various conditions related to decorators, classes, imports, and other factors. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
