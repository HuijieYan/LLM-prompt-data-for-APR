### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple issues that lead to failing tests. Some key problems identified are:
1. The function doesn't correctly handle the case when `current_line.is_import` is checked against `self.previous_line.is_import`. This check should be done by calling the `is_import` function instead of directly accessing `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`.
2. Incorrect handling of newlines insertion based on different conditions leads to mismatches between expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, follow these steps:
1. Replace the direct check for `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function.
2. Ensure that the correct logic regarding newlines and handling of various statements is implemented in the function.
3. Modify the function to correctly handle all edge cases based on the given input parameters and expected results.
4. Update the function to address all identified issues that cause the failing tests.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between imports.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_import(current_line) and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After applying the corrections, the fixed function should now handle the different cases correctly, leading to passing tests.
