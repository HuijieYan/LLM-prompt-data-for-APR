The bug in the provided `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of empty lines before certain types of statements. The function is designed to determine the number of empty lines to add before the current line based on specific conditions, but the logic appears to be flawed.

Here's a summary of the observed issues:
- The function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines before certain lines, leading to incorrect output and failing test cases.
- The logic for inserting empty lines is not consistent with the intended behavior in some scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic for determining when to insert empty lines and adjust it accordingly to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""  # Removing consumed newlines
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    # Check if the current line is a decorator, def, or a class
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    # Check if the current line is a flow control statement
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    # Check for specific cases where empty lines should not be inserted
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function and should produce the correct number of empty lines before the current line based on the specified conditions.
