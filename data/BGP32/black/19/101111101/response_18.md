## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of newlines when dealing with decorators, imports, and yields. The issue mainly lies in the decision-making logic within the function, which leads to unexpected empty lines being inserted in the output.

1. In the first case, where the `current_line` is marked as a decorator, the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to insert, leading to the wrong output.
2. In the second case, when the `current_line` contains "`# TODO: X`" but is not marked as a decorator, the function mistakenly handles the empty lines before the line.
3. The same logic applies to the third and fourth cases, where it incorrectly processes comments within the input lines.
4. In case five, where "`# TODO: Z`" is part of the line, the function wrongfully decides on the number of empty lines to insert due to improper handling of the comment.
5. In the sixth case, involving newlines around the "`@property`" part in the `current_line`, the function does not handle the logic correctly, leading to the bug.
6. Lastly, in the seventh case, where the function gets the line depth and leaves for a "def" block, the error persists due to flawed logic in handling the previous lines and defined blocks.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To rectify the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the decision-making logic related to decorators, comments, and various line characteristics should be revised. Special attention should be given to ensuring the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the context of the lines being analyzed. Additionally, the handling of specific cases such as imports, decorators, and yields need to be approached correctly to prevent incorrect output.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that has been updated to address the bugs and is expected to pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
     
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if (not current_line.is_yield) or (depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By revising the decision-making logic and correctly handling cases involving decorators, imports, comments, and other specific line types, the updated function should now insert the appropriate number of empty lines based on the context, resolving the bug issues.
