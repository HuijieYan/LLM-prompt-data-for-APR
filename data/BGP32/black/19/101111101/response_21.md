## Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs because of the incorrect check for `self.previous_line.is_import`. The function is trying to call `is_import` directly on `self.previous_line`, but the `is_import` function is defined outside the class and can't be accessed directly like an instance method of `self`. This causes a NameError since `self.previous_line.is_import` tries to access a function that is not a part of the Line class or the EmptyLineTracker class where `_maybe_empty_lines` is defined.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to update the access to the `is_import` function correctly. Instead of trying to access it as a method of `self.previous_line`, we should call the `is_import` function as a standalone function. This requires importing the `is_import` function in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and then calling it on the `previous_line` object.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
from black import is_import

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected the function call
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By importing the `is_import` function in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and calling it correctly, we have fixed the bug that was causing the failing test. Now, the function should work as intended and pass the test cases.
