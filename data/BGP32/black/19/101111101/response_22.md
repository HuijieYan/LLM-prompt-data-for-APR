The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how it handles empty lines in specific cases. The current implementation doesn't seem to accurately determine the number of newlines and spaces to insert between lines, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to properly handle different scenarios based on the line properties. We need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines and spaces are inserted based on specific conditions such as decorators, imports, yield statements, etc.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control or (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 0, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 0, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues identified in the failing tests by properly handling the cases where newlines and spaces need to be inserted between lines based on specific line properties.

Please integrate this corrected version into your codebase and re-run the failing tests to confirm that the bug has been fixed.
