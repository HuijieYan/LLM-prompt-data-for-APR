## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the comparison done within the conditional statements checking if the `current_line` is an import, yield, or flow control.

1. The function checks if `self.previous_line` is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, `self.previous_line.is_import` is not a valid condition as `is_import` is a separate function and not an attribute of the `Line` class. This results in incorrect behavior when determining whether to insert empty lines.

2. Similarly, the function checks if `self.previous_line` is a yield using `self.previous_line.is_yield`, which results in similar erroneous behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to replace `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` with calls to the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions, respectively.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions return the correct values based on the provided `Leaf` elements. This will ensure that the correct conditions are met when determining whether to insert empty lines.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and is_yield(self.previous_line) and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for checking `is_import` and `is_yield` have been updated with calls to the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions. This ensures that the correct logic is applied when determining whether to insert empty lines.
