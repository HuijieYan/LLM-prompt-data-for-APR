## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to the incorrect handling of conditions related to `current_line.is_import`. The function tries to access `current_line.is_import` directly, which is a boolean attribute and does not correspond to a function `is_import` defined outside the function. This discrepancy results in a reference error when the function tries to check `self.previous_line.is_import` as it doesn't exist, leading to failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for `current_line.is_import`. The original function incorrectly accesses `current_line.is_import`, which is not correct. We should replace this with a call to the correct function `is_import(current_line)`. 

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the correct function call `is_import(current_line)`, we can now accurately check if the previous line is an import and adapt the logic based on that information. This correction should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
