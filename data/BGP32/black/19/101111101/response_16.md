## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect comparison used to check if `self.previous_line` is an import line. The buggy line `self.previous_line.is_import` is problematic because `self.previous_line` is of the `Line` class, which does not have an `is_import` attribute. Instead, the `is_import` function should be called with `self.previous_line` as the argument to properly check if the previous line was an import.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly determine if the previous line was an import line.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
After applying the fix, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is as follows:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly identify if the previous line was an import and make decisions based on that, resolving the bug and enabling the failing tests to pass.
