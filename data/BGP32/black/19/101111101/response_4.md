### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of the `is_import` attribute of `Line` objects. The function tries to access `current_line.is_import` directly, assuming it exists as an attribute of the `Line` class. However, the actual check for `is_import` is performed using a separate function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`, which returns a boolean value based on the leaf object.

Since the `is_import` function is not directly related to the `Line` class and is a standalone function, the buggy function should call `is_import` with the relevant leaf object to determine if a line is an import. This leads to a mismatch in the condition checks within the function, resulting in incorrect handling of imports.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Replace the direct access to `current_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function passing the relevant leaf object.
2. Modify the function to handle import checks correctly by utilizing the `is_import` function.
3. Ensure that the function correctly evaluates whether a line represents an import statement to maintain the expected behavior of the function.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line.leaves[0])  # call is_import function
        and not is_import(first_leaf)  # check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these modifications to correctly check for import statements using the `is_import` function, the function should now handle import-related conditions accurately and resolve the bug.
