## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the way it handles empty lines. The function is designed to determine whether empty lines should be added or removed based on criteria related to the current and previous lines.

One of the key issues causing the bug is the incorrect assignment of `newlines` when the function encounters a decorator, a `def` keyword, or a `class` keyword in the current line. These conditions should adjust the number of empty lines differently, but the current implementation does not handle them correctly.

Additionally, the way the function updates the `self.previous_defs` list when encountering `def` keywords is flawed. The list should store the depth values of the previous `def` keywords to ensure the correct number of empty lines is inserted before each one. However, the logic for updating this list is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior and failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added or removed in various scenarios involving decorators, `def` keywords, and `class` keywords. Additionally, we need to correct the handling of the `self.previous_defs` list to store and update the depth values of previous `def` keywords correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the conditions for adding or removing empty lines based on specific line properties and ensuring that the `self.previous_defs` list behaves as expected, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and handle empty lines correctly.
