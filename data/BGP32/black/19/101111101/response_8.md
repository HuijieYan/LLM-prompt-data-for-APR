### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when determining the number of newlines to add before the current line based on various conditions. One specific issue arises when checking for previous line attributes, such as `is_import` or `is_yield`, to decide whether to add a newline.

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function uses `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` to check if the previous line was an import or a yield statement. However, the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes are not defined within the `Line` class, and instead, methods `is_import` and `is_yield` are defined and available from the `leaf` object within the function. 

This inconsistency leads to the function incorrectly attempting to access attributes that do not exist within the `Line` class, causing a failure in the logic flow when making decisions based on these nonexistent attributes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to correct the way it accesses the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes. Since these attributes are methods defined at the leaf level, the function should use the `is_import` and `is_yield` methods from the first leaf in the `current_line` object rather than directly accessing them from `self.previous_line`.

We should modify the code inside the function to call `is_import` and `is_yield` methods on `current_line.leaves[0]` instead of attempting to access `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function after fixing the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        current_line.leaves[0].is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == current_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        current_line.leaves[0].is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this correction and using the correct method calls, the function should now correctly determine the number of newlines to add before the current line based on the defined conditions, passing the failing tests in the process.
