### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the logic related to determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function contains conditional statements that adjust the number of empty lines based on various properties of the `current_line` object, such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, etc. However, some of these conditions are not properly implemented or are overlooking certain scenarios, resulting in incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines needed.

### Bug Location
1. The handling of `before` variable is inconsistent and prone to errors.
2. The logic related to `previous_defs` is not accurately updating the number of empty lines.
3. The condition related to decorators and inserting empty lines between decorators needs refinement.
4. Some of the return statements do not consider all relevant scenarios.
5. Incorrect handling of `flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the following strategies can be applied:
1. Ensure that the calculation of the number of empty lines (`before` and `newlines`) is consistent.
2. Check the conditions involving `previous_defs` for updating the number of empty lines.
3. Review the decorator logic and the conditions for inserting empty lines between decorators.
4. Correctly handle scenarios involving `flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.

### Corrected Version

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control and not self.previous_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for determining the number of empty lines have been revised and updated to address the issues identified in the buggy function. This updated version should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the input parameters and conditions provided.
