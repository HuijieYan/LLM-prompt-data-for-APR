### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic related to appending values to the `previous_defs` list. In the original implementation, the values are added without considering the distinction between new definitions (functions or classes) and decorators. This causes incorrect behavior in cases where the function is dealing with decorators or new definitions, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around appending values to the `previous_defs` list. Specifically, we need to separate the handling of decorators from new definitions to ensure correct tracking of definition depths. Additionally, we need to refine the conditions for inserting empty lines based on whether the current line is a decorator, a new definition (def or class), flow control, import, or yield statement.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        else:
            if not self.previous_line:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            if not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0

```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for handling decorators, new definitions, and the insertion of empty lines based on various conditions related to the current and previous lines. It ensures proper tracking of definition depths and correct behavior for different types of statements encountered in the code.
