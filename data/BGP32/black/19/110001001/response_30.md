### Error location
The bug is related to the calculation of the number of empty lines (`newlines`) to insert before and after the currently processed line in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The function logic is not handling certain conditions correctly, leading to incorrect output values for `newlines`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for calculating `newlines` based on the given conditions.
2. Ensure that the conditions are properly checked and accounted for to determine the correct number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the logic issues by properly considering the conditions and correctly calculating the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line.
