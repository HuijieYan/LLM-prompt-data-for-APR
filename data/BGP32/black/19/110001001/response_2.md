### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the assignment of the `before` variable inside the while loop where it is always set to either 1 or 2, instead of retaining its original value calculated before the loop. This leads to incorrect return values when determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `before` variable should be preserved before entering the while loop so that it maintains the correct value calculated based on the condition before the loop. Additionally, the return statement inside the loop needs to be adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        original_before = before # Preserve the original before value
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return original_before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (original_before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (original_before or 1), 0

        return original_before, 0
```

By preserving the original `before` value and adjusting the return statements inside the loop, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
