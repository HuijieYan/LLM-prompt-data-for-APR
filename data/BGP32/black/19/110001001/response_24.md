### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for updating the `before` variable and `self.previous_defs` list based on certain conditions is not correctly implemented. This results in incorrect values being returned at the end of the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for updating the `before` variable and `self.previous_defs` list based on the conditions provided. Additionally, ensure that the return values reflect the expected behavior according to the function's purpose.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the logic issues found in the original implementation, ensuring that the function behaves as intended for various scenarios.
