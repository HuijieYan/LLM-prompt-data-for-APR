The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` lies in the logic used to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The function fails to update the `self` object with the changes made during its execution, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, the function relies on the state of the `self.previous_defs` list, but it does not update this list correctly, causing discrepancies in subsequent calls.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that whenever `self.previous_defs` is updated within the function, the changes are reflected in the `EmptyLineTracker` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    name: str
    prefix: str

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: list
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line = None
    previous_after: int = 0
    previous_defs: list = field(default_factory=list)

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            self.previous_defs = []
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        self.previous_defs = []
        return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I added `self.previous_defs = []` to reset the previous defs list appropriately in cases where the function should clear or update it. This way, the function maintains the correct state across different invocations and accurately tracks the needed empty lines before and after each line.

Make sure to integrate this fix into your existing codebase and test it thoroughly to ensure the functionality is working as expected.
