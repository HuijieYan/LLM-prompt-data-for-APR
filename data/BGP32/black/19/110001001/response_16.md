### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic flow and handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function is supposed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed based on certain conditions of the input line. However, the current implementation has issues with updating the `before` variable and handling the previous definitions.

#### Issues:
1. The calculation and updates to the `before` variable are inconsistent and may not account for all potential scenarios.
2. The handling of `self.previous_defs` to track previous definitions is flawed as it may not account for the correct depth levels.
3. The conditions for checking various line types like decorators, control flow, imports, and yields are processed in a way that can lead to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line needs to be revised. Specifically, we need to ensure that the calculations are accurate and consider all relevant conditions and previous definitions properly.

### Updated Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Set the maximum allowed empty lines
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Reset the before count and consume extra newlines
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before += first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    # Update `before` based on previous definitions
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues found in the buggy function and should now provide the correct number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the given conditions.
