### Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional block for detecting decorators. In the buggy code, when the current line is a decorator, it incorrectly checks if `is_decorator` is `True` and proceeds with the additional logic inside that block, which is incorrect. This results in cases where decorators are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.
Additionally, the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line is also problematic, leading to incorrect spacing in some scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition for decorators to correctly check if the `is_decorator` attribute of the `current_line` is `True`.
2. Adjust the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line to ensure correct spacing.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function will correctly handle decorators and ensure the proper insertion of empty lines based on the context of the current and previous lines.
