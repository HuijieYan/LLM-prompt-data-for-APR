### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the computation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. In several cases, the function returns incorrect values due to the logic and conditions applied. One major issue is that the function does not properly update or handle the `before` value, resulting in incorrect calculation of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value is correctly updated based on the conditions within the function. Additionally, we should adjust the logic to correctly handle the different cases that determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic and ensuring that the `before` value is correctly handled in different scenarios, the corrected function should now calculate the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the current line in a more accurate manner.
