### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in how it handles the logic for determining the number of empty lines. In particular, in certain conditions, the function should return `0, 0`, but due to incorrect checks and updates in the code, it sometimes returns other values leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily caused by how the function handles conditions related to decorators, imports, flow control, and previous definitions. Incorrect assignments and missing checks prevent the function from returning the correct number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to carefully analyze each condition and ensure that the correct values are assigned based on the logic described in the function's requirements.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    before = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorporates the necessary fixes to address the bugs identified in the original implementation based on the runtime values and logic analysis provided.
