### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the variable `before` when updating its value based on certain conditions. In particular, the assignment of `before` within the while loop and subsequent return statements is not consistently implemented, causing unexpected behaviors in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The inconsistent logic in updating `before` based on different cases leads to incorrect return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the variable `before` is updated correctly and consistently based on the defined conditions. Specifically, we should review and modify the logic inside the while loop and adjust the return statements to provide accurate results for the number of empty lines needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the while loop and adjusting the return statements, we should now have a more robust and correct implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
