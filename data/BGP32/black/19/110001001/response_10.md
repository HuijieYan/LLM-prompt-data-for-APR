### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug lies in the logic related to tracking and managing previous definitions and decorators, leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines.

### Issues:
1. The handling of `previous_defs` list is inconsistent, leading to incorrect decisions on inserting empty lines before or after the current line.
2. The conditions for determining when to insert empty lines are not properly defined, causing improper behavior based on the current line's attributes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from incorrect handling of previous definitions depth and decorators, resulting in wrong decisions on when to insert empty lines. Inadequate checks and inconsistent updates to `previous_defs` lead to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for maintaining and checking `previous_defs` list to accurately track the previous definition depths.
2. Adjust the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the current line's attributes to ensure proper spacing in the code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic associated with `previous_defs` and adjusting the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the current line's properties, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and provide the expected behavior.
