### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line. One of the main issues is that the logic for handling the `self.previous_defs` list is causing incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines needed. It also fails to accurately determine when to return the number of empty lines.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the logic related to handling `self.previous_defs` and calculating the number of empty lines based on the current line's attributes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the initial value of `max_allowed` reflects the correct value based on the `current_line.depth`.
2. Adjust the logic for handling `self.previous_defs` to accurately update and pop elements based on the current line's depth.
3. Refactor the return statements to correctly calculate and return the number of empty lines based on different conditions.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling `self.previous_defs` has been modified to correctly manage the list based on the current line's depth. Additionally, the return statements have been refactored to accurately calculate and return the number of empty lines based on different conditions. These changes should address the bug in the original function.
