### Bug Explanation
In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, there is a logical error when checking and updating the `before` variable. The issue arises when `depth` is considered inside the loop while updating `before`. The value of `before` should not replace the value obtained from consuming the first leaf's newlines if there are multiple instances to consume. This results in incorrect handling of the number of newlines before the current line. This incorrect logic leads to incorrect empty line insertion in scenarios where it's needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic for updating the `before` value works properly and respects the maximum count of newlines allowed. We should maintain the count of consumed newlines separate from the actual count of newlines before the line. This will ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the actual scenario.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        consumed_newlines = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            consumed_newlines = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix[consumed_newlines * len("\n"):]
        
        before = consumed_newlines
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we maintain the count of consumed newlines in the `consumed_newlines` variable and update `before` correctly based on this count. This should resolve the issue of incorrect empty line insertion based on the provided scenarios.
