### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic related to handling the `self.previous_defs` list. The function incorrectly updates the `before` variable inside a while loop that checks the `self.previous_defs` list for conditions related to depth that leads to incorrect output in certain scenarios.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the section where the while loop iterates over `self.previous_defs` and updates the `before` variable based on depth conditions within the loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to refactor the while loop logic to ensure that the `before` variable updates correctly for each iteration based on the `depth` condition and the value from `self.previous_defs`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    for depth_idx, prev_depth in reversed(list(enumerate(self.previous_defs))):
        if prev_depth < depth:
            break
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Changes Made
- Replaced the while loop with a for loop that iterates through `self.previous_defs` in reverse order and updates the `before` variable correctly based on the depth conditions.

By making this adjustment, the function should now handle the `self.previous_defs` list more accurately and provide the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
