The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from not handling the case where the depth is 0 properly, leading to incorrect behavior in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. 

Given the provided runtime examples, it is evident that the issue lies in the condition where `depth` is 0. In these cases, the maximum allowed empty lines should be set to 1 instead of 2.

To fix this bug, we need to change the comparison in setting the `max_allowed` variable when `current_line.depth == 0`. Additionally, the `before` variable should be set to `(before or 1)` to ensure that it doesn't remain 0 when a non-zero value is expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = (before or 1)
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the correct number of empty lines is determined based on the depth and other conditions specified in the function.
