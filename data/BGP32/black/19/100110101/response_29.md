### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the provided line based on certain conditions and context. The function checks various properties of the `current_line` object and makes decisions accordingly.

The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs of the function. This discrepancy is likely due to incorrect computations or conditions in the function leading to the wrong number of empty lines being returned.

### Bug:
The bug in the function arises in the logic flow for handling decorators. When a line is identified as a decorator, the function should not insert empty lines before it. However, the existing implementation is not properly handling this case, leading to incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic related to decorators in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. We should ensure that the function correctly handles decorators and avoids inserting empty lines before them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if depth:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            newlines = 2
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now includes the necessary adjustments to handle decorators correctly and ensure the proper insertion of empty lines based on the given context. The function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
