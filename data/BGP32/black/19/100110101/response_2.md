### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to occur when handling comments within decorators. The function is supposed to handle cases where comments are present within decorators correctly, but it fails to do so based on the failing test case provided.

The failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` highlights the issue of incorrect handling of comments within decorators, which leads to differences between the expected and actual output. The error message specifically shows the assertion failure due to mismatched format with comments in between decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we should ensure that comments within decorators are correctly handled according to the expected behavior. This involves properly adjusting the conditions and logic for handling empty lines around decorators and comments.

### Correction:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Check if it's a comment within a decorator
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.leaves:
        newlines = 0
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adding a specific check for comments within decorators and ensuring that the correct number of newlines are returned in such cases, the corrected function should now handle the failing test case and fulfill the expected input/output requirements for all given cases.
