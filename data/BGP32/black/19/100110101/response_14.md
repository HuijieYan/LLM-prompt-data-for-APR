### Analysis:
This `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to have a bug that causes incorrect behavior when handling the input conditions specified by the test cases. In particular, the cases where `current_line` has `depth = 0` and `is_decorator = True` are causing the function to return incorrect numbers of newlines.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the case where `current_line.depth == 0` and `current_line.is_decorator is True`, the function is expected to insert 2 newlines after such a line. However, there are conditions that cause the function to return 2 newlines in some scenarios, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug in this function, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles the conditions specified by the function's functionality. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic to correctly determine the number of newlines to insert after lines with `depth = 0` and `is_decorator = True`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator: # Check if it's not a decorator
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and
            current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and 
            (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic as shown above, the function should now correctly handle the input conditions and return the expected number of newlines as per the test cases specified.
