### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines. The function determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on different conditions related to the current line and the previous lines. The bug might be causing incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions.

### Bug:
The bug seems to occur when the function incorrectly calculates the `before` variable for handling empty lines before the current line based on certain conditions. This leads to incorrect output and assertion failures in the test function.

### Potential location of error:
1. Incorrect calculation of `before` variable.
2. Incorrect handling of different cases and conditions.

### Bug in the current code:
The bug is most likely related to how the `before` variable is calculated and updated in different parts of the function. The incorrect handling of the `before` variable based on different conditions for empty lines is leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted, causing assertion failures in the test function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Review and correct the calculation and use of the `before` variable in the function based on different conditions.
2. Ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the line is correctly implemented for each condition.
3. Verify that the function correctly handles all possible cases to insert the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions.

### Corrected code:
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with fixes to address the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test case to verify that the bug has been fixed and that the function now produces the expected output.
