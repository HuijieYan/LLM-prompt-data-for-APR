The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has issues related to managing empty lines before certain types of lines. There are several potential issues that can lead to the failing test:
1. The if condition to check for decorators is not correctly handling the case where `is_decorator` is `False`.
2. The check for `current_line.is_flow_control` may not be returning the expected values.
3. The conditions involving imports, yields, and the previous line are not handling all cases correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions within the function to correctly handle all scenarios based on the input `current_line` attributes. Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the conditions and returns the expected values based on the input `current_line` attributes. After making these changes, the function should now behave as expected for the given test cases and pass the failing test.
