### Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted in the code according to specific conditions. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior, causing the failing test.

1. The handling of empty lines between decorators is not correctly implemented, which results in unexpected empty lines in the output.
2. The logic for previous definitions is not properly updating, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Adjust the conditions for inserting empty lines based on decorators to ensure correct behavior.
2. Update the logic for previous definitions to maintain the correct state for previous definitions.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if is_decorator and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions for empty lines between decorators and updating the logic for previous definitions, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
