The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the calculation of `before` variable within the while loop. The assignment of `before` inside the while loop is overriding its value inappropriately, leading to incorrect behavior in subsequent cases. To resolve this bug, we need to update the logic inside the while loop to correctly handle the assignment of `before` based on the conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    previous_defs = self.previous_defs[:]  # Make a copy to avoid modifying original list
    while previous_defs and previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
            
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is correctly updated within the while loop, and the conditions for handling newlines and empty lines are maintained according to the expected behavior in different scenarios. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
