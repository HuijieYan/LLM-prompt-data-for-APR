### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect settings for the variable `before`. The value of `before` is calculated and updated in several places within the function, leading to inconsistent behavior based on different conditions. This inconsistency results in the function returning incorrect values for `newlines` and `before` in cases where it should return different values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to manage the `before` variable properly and update it only in the relevant sections of the code to ensure correct behavior. We should also ensure that the value of `before` reflects the actual number of newlines that need to be added before the current line based on the specified conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import \
            and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield \
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the handling of the `before` variable in each condition and ensuring that it reflects the correct number of newlines, the corrected function should now return the expected values for the given test cases.
