### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle empty lines based on certain conditions related to the input `current_line`. However, there are multiple issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior, causing the failing test case to not pass. The function checks various properties of `current_line` such as depth, leaves, and specific flags like `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to determine the number of empty lines to insert. The presence of incorrect assignments, logic errors, and missing conditions result in the function not fulfilling the expected behavior.

### Bug fixes
1. The calculation of the `before` variable is incorrect. It should consider the minimum of the current value and `max_allowed`. The value of `before` should not be overwritten unnecessarily.

2. The reassignment of `before` in the while loop is problematic. It should only update `before` based on the current depth and not take a fixed value. The assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` should be adjusted.

3. The conditions for handling specific cases like decorators, defs, classes, and flow controls seem to be incomplete or incorrect. The conditions that check whether to insert empty lines or not should be revised to align with the expected behavior.

4. The function should correctly update `self.previous_defs` when encountering a new definition block.

### Updated function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = min(depth, max_allowed)

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying the above fixes, the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the given conditions and satisfy the expected test cases.
