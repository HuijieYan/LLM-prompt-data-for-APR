### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function has several conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. The bug seems to be related to how the `before` variable is calculated and used in different cases. In some cases, `before` is set but then overwritten depending on other conditions, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes incorrect empty line insertion based on certain conditions, leading to failed tests. The bug arises due to the variable `before` being set as part of the logic, but then later modified incorrectly in the subsequent code. This incorrect modification results in the wrong number of empty lines being inserted, affecting the formatting and breaking the test cases.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is calculated correctly based on the conditions outlined in the function.
2. Avoid unnecessary overwriting of the `before` variable to maintain the correct count of empty lines to insert.
3. Update the conditional logic to handle different cases appropriately, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        prefix_newlines = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(prefix_newlines, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the empty line insertion logic correctly and pass the failing test cases.
