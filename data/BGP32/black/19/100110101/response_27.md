### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is called with the provided test case. The function has conditions to handle different cases based on the properties of the `current_line` parameter, such as `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. The bug is likely related to how these conditions are handled and the updating of the `before` variable within the function's logic.

### Bug Location
One potential bug location is in the block of code after the condition `if current_line.leaves`. The `before` variable is updated twice without resetting the count. This leads to incorrect values of `before` in subsequent parts of the code, impacting the final return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated and maintained throughout the function. Additionally, we need to carefully handle the various conditions based on the properties of `current_line` to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After making these corrections to the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the corrected version should be able to pass the failing test case described above and satisfy the expected input/output values for all the identified cases.
