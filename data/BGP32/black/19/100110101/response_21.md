### Bug Explanation:
The bug is in the logic of handling empty lines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue arises when there is a line with a comment in a decorator. The function is incorrectly determining the number of required empty lines in such cases, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

### Bug Location:
The problematic code is in the section where the function checks for decorator lines. It incorrectly handles the cases where comments exist within decorators, causing the function to miscount the required empty lines.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic in the decorator section to correctly handle cases where comments are present within decorators.
2. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines are returned based on the specified conditions to pass the failing test case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issues in handling comments within decorators should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test case successfully.
