Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test case, the main issue arises when handling empty lines around decorators. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the case where a decorator is followed by comments, resulting in incorrect newlines being inserted. 

To address this bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to correctly handle the case when a decorator is followed by comments while ensuring the correct number of newlines are inserted based on the context.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.comments:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes handling cases where decorators are preceded or succeeded by comments appropriately to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted as required by the context.

By using this corrected function, the failing test case should now pass as the expected behavior will match the actual output.
