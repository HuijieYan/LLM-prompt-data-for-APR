### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions like depth, leaf content, flow control, import statements, etc. However, the function seems to have a logical error in handling the `before` variable, which is used to keep track of empty lines before the current line.

The bug could be related to how the `before` variable is updated and used in different conditions within the function. The incorrect assignment or resetting of `before` may lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the improper resetting of the `before` variable in some conditions when it should have been maintained for future calculation. The incorrect management of the `before` variable results in incorrect numbers of empty lines being inserted before the current line.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is appropriately updated and handled for each condition.
2. Maintain the `before` count correctly based on each condition without unnecessary resetting.
3. Verify the logic and conditions where the `before` variable is used to ensure correct insertion of empty lines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - (1 if current_line.depth else 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By maintaining the `before` variable correctly throughout the function and ensuring it is updated appropriately based on conditions, the corrected version should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly in various scenarios.
