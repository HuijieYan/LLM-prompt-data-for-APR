### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling empty lines before certain types of lines like decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields. The bug causes incorrect handling of the `before` variable and the number of newlines to be inserted before the current line. This results in incorrect formatting of the code, as evidenced by the failing test case where the actual and expected outputs do not match due to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to correct the logic for handling empty lines before various types of lines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct number of newlines is calculated based on the context of the current line and the previous line. We also need to update the logic for handling decorators, imports, and yields to insert newlines correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the logic for handling empty lines before various types of lines is corrected, ensuring that the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the context. This should enable the function to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
