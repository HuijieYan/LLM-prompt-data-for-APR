### Correction Strategy
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have issues related to determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on various conditions. The function fails to handle some scenarios correctly, leading to the failing test cases. To fix the bug:

1. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions specified.
2. Verify that the handling of depth, decorators, imports, yields, flow control, and previous line types is accurate.
3. Update the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line to align with the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the function based on the corrections mentioned above, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
