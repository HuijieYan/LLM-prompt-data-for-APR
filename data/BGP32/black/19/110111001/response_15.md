### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to compute the number of extra empty lines that should be added before and after the current line based on various conditions. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior and failing test cases.

1. The function incorrectly determines the number of empty lines to add before the current line. The logic for handling decorators, definitions, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields is flawed, leading to incorrect calculations and unexpected behavior.

2. The function does not properly manage the list `self.previous_defs`, which is used to keep track of previous definitions. In some cases, elements are not added correctly or removed when needed.

3. The function lacks a comprehensive and accurate approach to handle different scenarios, resulting in incorrect decisions on adding empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bugs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revise the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on specific conditions. Additionally, we need to ensure the proper management of `self.previous_defs` list to accurately track previous definitions.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the identified issues and runtime values:

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Any
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if current_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        return before, 0
``` 

By updating the logic to properly handle different scenarios and ensuring correct manipulation of relevant variables, the corrected version of the function should address the issues and pass the failing test cases.
