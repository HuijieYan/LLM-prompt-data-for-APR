### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional logic determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function incorrectly handles empty lines and line spacing in various scenarios, leading to incorrect output and failing test cases.

1. In Case 1, when the `current_line` represents a decorator and the `depth` is equal to 0, the function calculates `before` based on the newlines in the first leaf's prefix. If the `current_line` is a decorator, the expected behavior is different based on additional conditions which are not properly handled.

2. In Case 2, the function fails to consider the handling of decorators properly. As a result, the test fails when comparing the generated output with the expected output.

3. In Case 3, there is a discrepancy in determining the number of newlines before and after the current line when processing decorators, leading to an incorrect output that does not match the expected one.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the conditional logic properly handles all cases including decorators, classes, def statements, imports, yield statements, etc., to compute the correct number of empty lines.

The strategy for addressing the bug involves revising the logic inside the function to cover all the edge cases and conditions accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1 if depth else 2
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the function should now correctly determine the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the current line based on all the presented conditions. This revised version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
