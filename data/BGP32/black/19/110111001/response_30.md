### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to handling the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function contains logic to determine the required empty lines based on various conditions like depth, whether the line is a decorator or part of a function definition, flow control, import statement, etc.

The bug arises from the improper handling of empty lines when processing lines that are decorators or function definitions. In these cases, the function should return the correct number of empty lines before and after the line based on the context of the previous line, the current line, and the surrounding structure of the code. Incorrect calculations lead to an incorrect number of empty lines being returned, causing the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the logic for determining the number of required empty lines before and after the line needs to be carefully revised. The function should consider all relevant conditions and properly handle the cases of decorators, function definitions, import statements, flow control, and other scenarios.

The function should ensure consistent and accurate calculation of empty lines based on the context and structure of the code. This includes setting the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line to maintain code readability and structure.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By making the necessary corrections in the function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests related to handling empty lines for decorators, function definitions, and other code structures should pass successfully.
