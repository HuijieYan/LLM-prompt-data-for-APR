### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by the improper handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function attempts to adjust the number of empty lines based on various conditions such as current line type, depth, imports, and decorators. However, there are several issues in the logic flow of the function that lead to incorrect results, causing the failing tests.

1. The handling of `before` and `max_allowed` is inconsistent and can result in incorrect values.
2. Inconsistent usage of `depth` and `previous_defs` leads to erroneous empty line calculations.
3. Not updating the `self.previous_line` properly in certain conditions.
4. Incorrect computation of the number of newlines in specific cases.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `before` and `max_allowed` values are correctly set and consistently handled.
2. Use a clear and consistent logic for updating `depth` and `previous_defs` to calculate the correct number of empty lines.
3. Update `self.previous_line` appropriately to prevent unnecessary empty line insertions.
4. Adjust the computation of newlines based on the current line attributes.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < current_line.depth]

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic in the function to handle empty lines more consistently and accurately based on the conditions present in each case, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
