### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The issue occurs when handling certain conditions related to decorators, classes, imports, and yields. In particular, the logic for handling decorators, classes, and imports might not correctly set the number of empty lines.

In Case 3, the input represents a scenario where the current line is a decorator, but the previous line is also a decorator. However, the logic does not account for consecutive decorators correctly, leading to incorrect output that doesn't match the expected value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to carefully examine the conditions that determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line. Specifically, we should focus on the cases related to decorators, classes, imports, and yields, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the context of the current and previous lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: List
    comments: List
    bracket_tracker: Any
    inside_brackets: bool
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class Leaf:
    token_id: int
    value: str

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
        before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            before = 1
            return before, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            before = 1
        return before, 0
```

By refining the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle each case based on the context of the current and previous lines, the corrected version should now provide the expected number of empty lines before and after the processed line.
