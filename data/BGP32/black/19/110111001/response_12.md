### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which is supposed to track the number of potential extra empty lines needed before the currently processed line. The function initializes `before` to 0 in each case encountered, which leads to incorrect calculation of the empty lines needed.

In some scenarios, the function should consider updating the `before` variable based on specific conditions, but due to the initialization at the beginning of the function, this adjustment is not reflected correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust how the `before` variable is updated based on specific conditions encountered during its execution. By evaluating the conditions properly and updating `before` accordingly, we can ensure the correct number of empty lines are accounted for before and after each line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with adjustments to properly calculate the number of empty lines required in different scenarios:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, ensuring that the failing test cases are resolved.
