### Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug occurs when handling decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yield statements, leading to incorrect computation of newlines and empty lines. The failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual formatted output due to the improper handling of comments and empty lines.

1. The function incorrectly assigns the `max_allowed` value depending on the depth of the current line, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.
2. The handling of `previous_defs` might not be appropriate, especially when popping values based on the depth.
3. The conditions governing the calculation of newlines and empty lines based on the type of the current line are not properly structured leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for determining `max_allowed` to ensure it correctly sets the maximum allowed empty lines.
2. Revise the handling of `previous_defs` to accurately store and remove depth values.
3. Refine the conditions governing the calculation of newlines and empty lines based on line type to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function after addressing the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    else:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as described above, the function should now calculate the correct number of empty lines needed based on the current line properties, addressing the bug and enabling the failing test to pass successfully.
