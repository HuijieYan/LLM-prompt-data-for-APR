### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has multiple conditional branches based on the properties of the `current_line`. However, there seems to be a logical error in handling the insertion of empty lines before and after certain types of lines.

In the provided test case `test_comment_in_decorator`, the error occurs when comparing the expected and actual values returned by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The returned values include prefixes (comments) on lines, and discrepancies in the handling of empty lines contribute to the failing test.

Here are some key findings from the runtime input/output values for the various cases:
1. The logic for handling `is_decorator` in the function might not be correctly updating `previous_defs` when necessary, resulting in incorrect counts for empty lines.
2. The conditions related to `is_decorator` and `is_flow_control` might be affecting the decision to insert empty lines inaccurately.
3. The logic related to handling `is_import` and `is_yield` lines might not be calculating expected empty line counts correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issues identified in the analysis, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the state of `previous_defs` is correctly updated based on the current situation, especially when dealing with decorators.
2. Review the logic concerning the insertion of empty lines to consider edge cases for various line types.
3. Adjust the conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield` handling to determine the correct number of required empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function after addressing the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to the logic of the function, the corrected version should pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
