### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the current line, previous line, depth, previous definitions, etc., to decide the number of empty lines to insert.

The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the current line, as indicated by the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.

1. Case 1:
   - The function is handling a line with `current_line.depth` as 0 and `current_line.is_decorator` as True.
   - It sets `max_allowed` to 2 initially.
   - It then proceeds to update the number of empty lines before the current line: `before` is set to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `(2, 0)` as the expected output.

2. Case 2:
   - The function is handling a line with `current_line.depth` as 0 and `current_line.is_decorator` as False.
   - It uses the previous line to calculate the number of empty lines to insert.
   - Expected output should be `(0, 0)`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the calculation of the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The conditions and logic in the function are not correctly handling the cases which leads to an incorrect number of empty lines being determined. Specifically, incorrect handling of `before` and `newlines` variables is leading to the bug.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the logic related to the calculation of empty lines before and after the current line. We need to correctly handle the cases based on conditions like whether the current line is a decorator, class definition, flow control statement, import, or yield, and adjust the number of empty lines accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 0, 0

    before = current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n") if current_line.leaves else 0
    before = min(before, max_allowed)

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the specified conditions.
