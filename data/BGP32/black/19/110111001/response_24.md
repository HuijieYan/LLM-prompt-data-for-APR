### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from how the function handles the insertion of empty lines when encountering certain types of lines, such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields. The function calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.

One specific issue leading to the bug is the incorrect handling of the `before` variable when certain conditions are met. In particular, in the final part of the function where it handles cases related to imports and yields, there's an incorrect assignment to `before` that does not account for the initial value of `before` that was calculated earlier.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the `before` variable retains its calculated value unless it needs to be updated dynamically based on specific conditions. It's important to preserve the originally calculated `before` value in scenarios where it should not be altered.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis and the bug fix strategy, the corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before += min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue with the mishandling of the `before` variable and ensure that the function calculates the correct number of potential extra empty lines before and after the processed line under different conditions.
