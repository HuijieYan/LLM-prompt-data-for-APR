### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple conditions and logic to determine the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line. The bug seems to stem from the computation of the `before` variable within the function. The logic for updating the `before` variable based on the `self.previous_defs` list and the depth of the current line is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines are calculated, we need to revisit the logic where `before` is updated within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The calculation of `before` should be based on the depth of the current line and whether certain conditions are met according to the code logic.

### Corrected Code
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple, List

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    # Fixing the buggy function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should provide the correct number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
