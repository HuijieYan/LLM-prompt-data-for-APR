### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to track and determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug seems to arise due to incorrect handling of `before` counts and conditions relating to decorators, imports, flow control, and yields. The function should correctly calculate and return the required number of empty lines based on the conditions provided.

1. The function incorrectly sets `before` to 1 in certain conditions for handling decorators, which may not be correct.
2. The function may not correctly handle the conditions for determining the correct number of empty lines before and after lines based on the context.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Ensure that the `before` count is correctly calculated and updated based on each condition. Avoid setting it to a fixed value without considering all conditions.
2. Review the different sections of conditions and returns to properly determine the required empty lines count for various scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By correcting the conditions and return statements in the function, it should now correctly determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
