### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several issues that are leading to the failing test cases. Here are some key points identified through the analysis:

1. The `before` value is being overwritten when adjusting the empty lines count based on certain conditions, leading to unexpected behavior in subsequent calculation steps.

2. The logic for handling decorators, def, and class statements does not properly consider the need for empty lines before and after these elements, resulting in incorrect newlines being returned.

3. The checks for flow control statements, import statements, and yield statements are not accurately determining the required number of empty lines.

4. There are inconsistencies in updating the `previous_defs` list and determining the depth of the current line, affecting the calculation of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the issues in the buggy function, the following steps can be taken:

1. Ensure that the `before` value is retained if it has been previously calculated.

2. Adjust the logic to correctly handle decorators, def, and class statements for determining empty lines before and after.

3. Revise the conditions for flow control, import, and yield statements to accurately calculate the number of required empty lines.

4. Update the handling of the `previous_defs` list and maintain the correct depth of the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import 
        and not current_line.is_import 
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield 
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By implementing the above fixes in the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the issues causing the failing test cases should be resolved, and the function should now provide the correct number of empty lines before and after each processed line as expected.
