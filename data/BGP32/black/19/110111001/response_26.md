### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, based on the failing test and the runtime inputs, the function is not handling some cases correctly. Here are the identified issues:
1. When `current_line.is_decorator` is true, the function incorrectly returns a tuple with `newlines` as 2 and the second value as 0. This leads to discrepancies in the generated output compared to the expected output, causing the test to fail.
2. The logic for handling decorators, especially in regard to managing empty lines, seems to be causing inconsistencies when deciding on the number of newlines necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the identified issues, we need to correct the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure it properly handles the scenarios where the current line is a decorator. By adjusting the handling of decorators and the computation of newlines, we can aim to align the function's behavior with the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 0, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 0, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected version of the function should now handle decorators and the associated empty lines more accurately, ensuring that the function aligns with the expected behavior and passes the failing test.
