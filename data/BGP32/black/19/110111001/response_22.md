### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is failing to correctly compute the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, leading to test failures. There are multiple potential issues with the function logic identified in the analysis:
1. The handling of `self.previous_defs` to keep track of previous definitions and potential extra empty lines is not correctly considering the depth of the current line and is not updating the `before` variable accordingly.
2. The conditions for different types of lines (`current_line.is_decorator`, `current_line.is_flow_control`, etc.) are not being checked in the right order, affecting the correct computation of empty lines.
3. The calculation of empty lines in various scenarios is not consistent with the expected behavior, causing discrepancies in the test results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the following strategy can be applied:
1. Properly maintain and update `self.previous_defs` list based on the depth of the current line to track the correct number of previous definitions.
2. Reorder the conditions for line types (`is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, etc.) to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the type of the current line.
3. Adjust the empty line calculation logic based on different scenarios and line types to align the function's behavior with the expected output.

### Bug Fix
Based on the analysis and strategy outlined above, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying these fixes, the corrected function should now behave according to the intended logic and pass the failing test scenarios.
