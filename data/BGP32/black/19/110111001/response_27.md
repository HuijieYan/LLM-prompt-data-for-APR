### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the current line, previous line, depth, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to decide on the number of empty lines.
3. The failing test scenario involves differences in the expected output compared to the actual output, specifically related to the placement of empty lines before and after lines of code, likely due to incorrect handling of certain situations.
4. The function seems to incorrectly handle the scenarios where decorators, imports, and specific relationships between lines are involved. It requires a more robust logic to determine the correct number of empty lines based on the context.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles decorators, imports, and specific relationships between lines to determine the necessary empty lines.
2. Keep track of previous definitions and relevant line attributes to make informed decisions.
3. Properly handle scenarios where decorators are involved and avoid unnecessary empty lines in specific cases.
4. Refactor the logic to distinguish between different line types and adjust the empty line count accordingly.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if is_decorator:
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By applying these logic changes, the function should now be able to accurately determine the appropriate number of empty lines based on various contextual factors.
