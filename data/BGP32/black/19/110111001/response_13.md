### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is causing issues in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has several conditional statements to handle different cases based on the characteristics of the input `current_line`, but there seem to be logical errors and inconsistencies in these conditions, which are causing the function to return incorrect values.

1. In some cases, the function is not correctly updating the `before` variable which is used to determine the number of empty lines before the line.
2. The cases involving decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., are not handling possible scenarios properly, leading to incorrect return values.
3. The condition blocks for different line types (decorator, def, class, flow control, import, yield) are not mutually exclusive, leading to confusion and wrong calculation of empty lines.
4. The function is not consistently updating the `before` variable when conditions are met, causing inconsistency in the return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle the logic for updating the `before` variable based on different conditions for better control of empty lines.
2. Ensure that the conditional blocks are mutually exclusive, i.e., only one block should be executed based on the provided conditions.
3. Update the logic for decorator, def, class, flow control, import, and yield cases to provide the correct number of empty lines before and after each type of line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        self.previous_defs = []
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By implementing the corrections and ensuring that the conditions are correctly handled based on the nature of the line being processed, the function should now return the accurate number of empty lines needed before and after each line.
