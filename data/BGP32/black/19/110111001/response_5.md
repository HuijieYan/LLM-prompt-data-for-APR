### Bug Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrectly calculating the number of empty lines to insert in specific scenarios.
3. From the failing test and runtime variable values:
   - In Case 1, the expected output does not match the actual output due to an error in the logic for calculating newlines before and after the current line.
   - In Case 2, a similar discrepancy in the calculation of newlines can be observed.
   - Cases 3, 4, 5, and 6 also show incorrect newline calculations leading to assertion errors.
   - In Case 7, incorrect insertion of empty lines occurs before the first line in the file.
   - Case 8 experiences a miscalculation in the number of newlines to insert after a line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the conditions specified.
2. Ensure that the calculations are accurate and align with the intended behavior of `_maybe_empty_lines`.
3. Handle different cases such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., appropriately to prevent incorrect empty line insertions.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines to add before and after the current line, resolving the bug and allowing the failing test cases to pass successfully.
