## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function contains multiple branching conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` object. The buggy behavior is causing discrepancies in the expected and actual output, leading to failing test cases.

### Identified Bug:
The bug seems to arise from incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines required before and after the `current_line`. The function incorrectly sets the number of newlines to be inserted in certain cases, leading to output mismatches with the expected results in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to reassess the logic within the function that computes the number of empty lines before and after the current line. Adjust the conditions and calculations to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the properties of the current line.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions and calculations in the corrected version, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined based on the characteristics of the `current_line`. This correction should address the discrepancies and make the function pass the failing tests.
