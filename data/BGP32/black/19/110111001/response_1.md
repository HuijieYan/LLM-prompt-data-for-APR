### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in how it handles the computation of `before` and the adjustments made based on different conditions. The issue is that the variable `before` is being overwritten in multiple places within the function without taking into account the previous value it had.

When processing certain conditions, `before` should retain its value if it was already set based on a previous condition. However, in the current implementation, `before` gets overwritten even when it should not be.

This leads to incorrect calculations and results in unexpected empty lines being added or removed before and after the currently processed line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that `before` is only modified when necessary based on specific conditions. When `before` is already set, it should not be changed in subsequent conditions unless required.

We can achieve this by preserving the original value of `before` and then applying adjustments based on the conditions that need to modify it. This way, the correct number of empty lines will be returned based on the cumulative conditions that are met.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0  # Initialize before variable
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By preserving the original value of `before` and only modifying it when needed, the corrected function should now provide the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the defined conditions.
