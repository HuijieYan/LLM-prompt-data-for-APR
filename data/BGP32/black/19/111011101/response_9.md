### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is meant to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles previous line information and the logic for inserting empty lines in specific cases.

### Issues
1. The function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines before the first line in the file, leading to misaligned outputs.
2. The logic for handling the insertion of empty lines between decorators and in other specific cases is not correctly implemented.
3. There seems to be a mistake in checking whether the current line or the previous line is an import statement, affecting the calculation of the required empty lines.

### Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correct the handling of empty lines before the first line in the file.
2. Adjust the logic for inserting empty lines between decorators and in other specific conditions.
3. Fix the condition checking related to import statements and yield statements to correctly determine the required number of empty lines.

### Implementation
Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified and provide the expected behavior for handling empty lines in different scenarios.
