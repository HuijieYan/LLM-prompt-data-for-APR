### Buggy Function Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions such as the current line's depth, type, and relationship with the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

The bug occurs when the function erroneously identifies whether the previous line is an import statement. The buggy line is:
```python
and self.previous_line.is_import
```

This line assumes that `is_import` is a property of the `previous_line` object, but it should actually be called as a separate function as defined in the `is_import` function outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

The bug causes incorrect handling of scenarios where the previous line is an import statement. As a result, the incorrect number of empty lines is inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should call the `is_import` function defined outside the class to determine if the previous line is an import statement. This will ensure that the correct logic is applied to check the type of the previous line.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
