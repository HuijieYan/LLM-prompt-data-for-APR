### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be incorrectly handling the logic related to the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after a line in code formatting. The function checks for various conditions like if the line is a decorator, definition, flow control, import, or yield statement and then decides how many empty lines to include before and after the current line.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `self.previous_line.is_import` condition. The function checks if the previous line is an import statement and the current line is not an import statement, and they are at the same depth. However, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is trying to access a method `is_import` on the `self.previous_line` object, which is not defined.

This seems to be the cause of the bug where the function is trying to access an `is_import` attribute on the `previous_line` instance, but it does not exist, resulting in an AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checking the import statement in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should call the defined function `is_import` passing `self.previous_line` as a parameter.

Additionally, we need to ensure that the logic within the function correctly handles all the cases related to empty line insertion based on the type of line being processed and the previous line.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the condition related to checking if the `previous_line` is an import statement, and correctly calling the `is_import` function to check this condition, we should be able to fix the bug and have the corrected function correctly handle the insertion of empty lines during the code formatting process.
