### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when trying to check whether the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object is `True`. The code accesses `self.previous_line.is_import` directly, assuming that `self.previous_line` will have an `is_import` attribute. However, since `is_import` is a standalone function and not a property of `Line`, directly accessing it in this context leads to the error when it is not found.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for `is_import` in the previous line. We can do this by checking if the variable `is_import` is `True` instead of trying to access it as an attribute of `self.previous_line`.

### The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if previous line is an import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
``` 

By replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)`, we can effectively check if the previous line is an import, fixing the bug in the function.
