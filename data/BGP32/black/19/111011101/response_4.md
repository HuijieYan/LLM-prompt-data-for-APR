## Bug Analysis
1. The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function due to incorrect handling of conditions related to empty lines.
2. The function seems to incorrectly set the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line based on various conditions.
3. In the failing test, the expected output does not match the actual output, indicating that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the input line and its attributes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the conditions for inserting empty lines and adjust them to match the expected behavior.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if not current_line.is_flow_control:
        before = 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0

    is_decorator_or_def_or_class = current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    if is_decorator_or_def_or_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This revised version of the function correctly determines the number of empty lines to insert based on the specific conditions for decorators, imports, yields, flow control, and other line types. It should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the insertion of empty lines.
