### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. Based on the failing test case, the bug seems related to the insertion of empty lines within decorators, specifically when handling comments.

1. In case 2, the failing test indicates a discrepancy in the expected and actual output where the inserted extra empty lines do not match. This likely stems from incorrect handling of comments within decorators.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the section of code that handles comments within decorators. The function does not properly handle the comments, identifier check for imports, and previous line conditions when deciding to insert empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review and adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions specified in the function. Specifically, we need to ensure proper handling of decorators, comments, and previous line conditions.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the function should now correctly handle the conditions related to decorators, comments, imports, and previous lines when determining the number of extra empty lines to insert.
