### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the condition checks for `is_import`, `is_yield`, and the handling of `before` value when updating the `previous_defs` list.

1. The bug seems to arise from incorrect checks related to `is_import` and `is_yield`, where the behavior inside the condition blocks may not be as intended.
2. Inconsistent handling of the `before` value update inside the while loop with `previous_defs`, causing discrepancies in the output based on the depth of the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure the correct handling of `is_import` checks, `is_yield` checks, and the management of the `before` value within the loop.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With the updated function, we have corrected the conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield`, ensuring proper handling of the `before` value updates and `previous_defs` list management. This correction should address the bug and align the function output with the expected values for various test scenarios.
