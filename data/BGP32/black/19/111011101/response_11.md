### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when trying to access the `is_import` property of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` objects. The issue lies in the logic that checks for import statements within the defined conditions. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch in the number of expected versus actual empty lines when handling comments within decorators.

The critical points contributing to the bug are:
1. Incorrectly comparing the `is_import` property of `current_line` and `self.previous_line`.
2. Incorrectly setting the `before` value based on depth conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic related to handling import statements by comparing the `is_import` property of `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. Additionally, we need to adjust the calculation of the before empty lines based on the depth conditions.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the comparison for the `is_import` property and adjusting the `before` calculation based on conditions, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test.
