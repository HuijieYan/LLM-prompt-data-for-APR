### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect logic when determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line of code. The function contains multiple conditions and computations based on the properties of the current and previous lines. The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the insertion of empty lines based on whether the current line is a decorator, a class definition, a flow control statement, an import statement, or a yield statement.

Based on the failing test cases and the analysis of runtime and expected values:
- The bug specifically seems to occur when the function is trying to detect if the current line is an import statement by calling `current_line.is_import`.
- The function erroneously assumes that `current_line.is_import` is a boolean method, but in reality, it seems that the correct check should be `is_import(current_line)`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Update the condition `current_line.is_import` to `is_import(current_line)` to correctly check if the current line is an import statement.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies whether the current line is an import statement or not, based on the `is_import` function.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the detection of import statements and properly calculate the required number of empty lines before and after the current line.
