## Step 3: Identifying the Bug
In analyzing the buggy function, we can see that the issue lies in the conditions related to `self.previous_line` and `current_line.is_import`. The buggy conditions check if the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import, in which case it returns `before` or `1`. The problem is that the function mistakenly checks `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the correct function `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

## Step 4: Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_line` is checked correctly by calling the `is_import()` function instead of accessing the attribute directly.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Changed to correctly call is_import() function
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

## Summary
The bug in the original function was caused by incorrectly referencing `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import()` function. By fixing this issue and ensuring the correct function call, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output.
