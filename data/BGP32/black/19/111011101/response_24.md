## Bug Analysis
The bug in the provided `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the usage of the `is_import` property of the `current_line` and `previous_line` objects. 

1. In the buggy function, it tries to check `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, the `Line` class does not have an `is_import` property defined. Instead, there is a separate function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` provided in the same file that checks if a leaf is an import. This function is called by `_maybe_empty_lines` to check for imports but is incorrectly used in the context of `current_line` and `previous_line`.

2. Due to this incorrect use of `is_import`, the checks for `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` will cause attribute errors and lead to unexpected behaviors during runtime.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to properly use the `is_import` function with the correct arguments (leaves) to determine if a line is an import. We should remove all incorrect usages of `is_import` as an attribute of the `Line` object and instead call the `is_import` function with appropriate arguments.

Let's redefine the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the checks for imports using the `is_import` function.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line.leaves[0])
        and not is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0])
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We use the `is_import` function correctly to check if a leaf is an import.
- Adjust the logic to properly handle the cases where we need to check for imports based on the first leaf of the current and previous lines.
- Remove the incorrect usages of `is_import` as an attribute of `current_line` and `previous_line`.

By implementing these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the checks related to imports and avoid the attribute errors encountered previously.
