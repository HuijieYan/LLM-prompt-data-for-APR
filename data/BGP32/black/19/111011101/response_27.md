### Analysis
The bug occurs when checking if the previous line is an import in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The bug arises from attempting to call the `is_import` method from the `previous_line` object, which is an instance of the `Line` class. Instead, the `is_import` method should be called from an external utility function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`. This error leads to the AttributeError since `is_import` is not a method of the `Line` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` method to correctly call the `is_import` function with the necessary parameters. We should remove the erroneous check `self.previous_line.is_import` and replace it with a call to the external `is_import` function with the appropriate leaf object. 

### Code Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and not is_import(self.previous_line.leaves) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line.leaves)`, we eliminate the AttributeError and ensure that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines to insert. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug.
