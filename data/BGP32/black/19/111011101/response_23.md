### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line in the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. In several scenarios, the function incorrectly handles the conditions related to previous lines, decorators, imports, and yields.
3. Specifically, the issue arises when checking for previous lines being imports or yields and setting the appropriate number of empty lines before the current line.
4. The buggy function does not correctly update the number of empty lines based on the conditions related to imports and yields.
5. This leads to incorrect handling of formatting when the function is called during the execution of the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. We need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the cases related to imports and yields to determine the number of empty lines.
2. Update the logic in the function to handle cases involving imports and yields more accurately.
3. Specifically, when the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import, the function should adjust the number of empty lines accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By making the adjustments described above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the cases related to imports and yields correctly and pass the failing test cases.
