### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from trying to access a method `is_import` as an attribute (`current_line.is_import`) on an instance of the `Line` class. However, the method `is_import` is not defined as an attribute of the `Line` class directly, rather it is defined in a separate function `is_import` outside the `Line` class but in the same module.

This leads to the error when the function tries to access `current_line.is_import` and triggers the error message `AttributeError: 'Line' object has no attribute 'is_import'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` method is called correctly by directly invoking it from the function, passing the appropriate arguments when needed. This involves modifying the conditions that check for `current_line.is_import` and replacing them with the correct invocation of the `is_import` function.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    is_current_import = is_import(current_line)  # Invoke the is_import method correctly

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_current_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I modified the code to invoke the `is_import` function correctly when checking for import lines, addressing the bug and ensuring that the function works as intended.
