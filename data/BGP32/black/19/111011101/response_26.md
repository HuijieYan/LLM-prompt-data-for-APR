### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the comparison `current_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function to determine if the current line is an import. This comparison will always be `False` as `current_line.is_import` is not a function but an attribute associated with the `current_line` object. As a result, the condition checking for imports will never be satisfied, leading to incorrect logic and output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `is_import` function to check if the current line is an import instead of directly using `current_line.is_import`.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Fixed the condition to check if the previous line is an import
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

By fixing the condition to check if the current and previous lines are imports, the corrected function should now correctly handle imports and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
