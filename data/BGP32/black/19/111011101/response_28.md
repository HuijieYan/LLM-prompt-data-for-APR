### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling the insertion of empty lines based on different criteria. The cases where the logic is flawed include handling decorators, special keywords, and previous line conditions.

1. The function incorrectly handles the case where `current_line.is_import`. It compares `self.previous_line.is_import` (which is a function call) to `current_line.is_import` (a boolean property), leading to incorrect behavior.
2. The logic for handling decorators and flow control constructs does not appropriately handle the situation where the current line is a decorator or a flow control construct.
3. The management of `self.previous_defs` is also flawed, leading to incorrect decisions when determining the number of empty lines.
4. There are issues with the assignment of `before` and `newlines` variables, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the identified issues:
1. Modify the comparison for `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly check if the previous line was an import.
2. Revise the logic for handling decorators, flow control constructs, and updating `self.previous_defs`.
3. Correct the assignment of `before` and `newlines` based on the current line's properties and the previous line's conditions.

### Updated `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these modifications to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the issues identified in the bug analysis should be resolved, and the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
