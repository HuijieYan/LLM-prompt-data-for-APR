### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of potential empty lines needed before and after a currently processed line. It checks various conditions based on the type of line being processed and the previous line to decide the number of empty lines to return.

### Identified Issue
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition where it checks if the `self.previous_line` is an import line (`self.previous_line.is_import`). The issue is that `self.previous_line.is_import` tries to access the method `is_import` on the `Line` object stored in `self.previous_line`. However, in the context of the `Line` class, there is no `is_import` method defined. Instead, there is a separate function defined outside the class named `is_import`.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to a mistaken assumption in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that it can directly access the `is_import` method on a `Line` object. However, the `is_import` function should be called separately on a `Leaf` object, which is performed correctly inside the `is_import` function defined outside the class. As a result, trying to access `is_import` directly on a `Line` object leads to a runtime error.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `is_import` function from the `is_import` function defined outside the class. We should pass the required `Leaf` object to the `is_import` function to check whether it is an import.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correctly using the `is_import` function outside the class to check for import lines, we address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
