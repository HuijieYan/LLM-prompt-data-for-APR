### Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect condition check related to the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` and `previous_line`. The function checks `self.previous_line.is_import`, which should instead call the `is_import` function passing the `previous_line` as the argument.

### Bug Cause
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function incorrectly accesses the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` directly without calling the `is_import` function, resulting in a runtime error.
2. When checking for the attribute `is_import`, it should be performed using the function `is_import(leaf)` instead.

### Proposed Fix
To resolve the bug, we need to correct the comparisons based on the `is_import` functions of `current_line` and `previous_line` values. By calling the `is_import` function on the relevant lines, we can ensure the correct comparison.

### Corrected Code
```python
# Updated buggy code with the correct condition for is_import check
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By ensuring that `is_import` is called as a function with the required parameters, we can correctly handle the comparison for the `is_import` attribute in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
