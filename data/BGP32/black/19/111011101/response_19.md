### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining when to insert empty lines before and after a line of code. The function incorrectly handles cases related to decorators, imports, and yield statements, leading to incorrect placement of empty lines in the output.

1. The function fails to handle cases where two import statements are placed consecutively, resulting in the incorrect insertion of empty lines.
2. It incorrectly handles cases involving yield statements, leading to issues in determining the required empty lines.
3. In some cases, the function fails to correctly identify whether a line is part of a decorator, which affects the decision to insert empty lines.

### Fix Strategy:
- The logic for handling imports and yield statements needs to be adjusted to correctly determine when to insert empty lines.
- The function should properly identify lines belonging to decorators to avoid unnecessary empty line insertions.
- Ensure that consecutive import statements are correctly handled to align with the expected output.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

By making the corrections mentioned above in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the issues related to incorrect empty line insertion for decorators, imports, and yield statements should be resolved. This should align the function's behavior with the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
