### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of empty lines based on various conditions such as current line depth, type, and relation with the previous line.

One potential issue is with the handling of the `before` variable. It is being updated multiple times within the function based on different conditions, which might be affecting the final result. Additionally, the `if-else` conditions for checking the type of the current line and previous line could be incorrect, leading to incorrect logic flow.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it is clear that the calculation of `newlines` and the `return` statements are not appropriate for some cases. This mismatch in calculations is causing the failing tests and assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specified conditions. This includes updating the handling of the `before` variable, ensuring proper checks for the type of the current line, and improving the decision-making process for returning the correct number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been fixed based on the identified issues. This updated version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the assertion errors.
