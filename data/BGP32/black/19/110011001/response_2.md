### Identified issue:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The variable `before` is calculated correctly based on certain conditions, but then it is overwritten in the `while` loop where it should not be reset to 1 or 2 based on the `depth`. This leads to incorrect behavior and output for cases where the previous depth is greater or equal to the current depth.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is only set based on certain conditions and not changed within the loop. This will ensure that the correct value of `before` is retained throughout the function execution.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the handling of the `before` variable, the function should now produce the correct output and pass the failing test cases.
