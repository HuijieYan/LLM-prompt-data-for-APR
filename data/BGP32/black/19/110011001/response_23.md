### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The function involves checking different properties of the `current_line` object and updating variables like `before`, `newlines`, and `depth` accordingly. However, the function has a logical error that causes incorrect computations, resulting in the failing test cases.

#### Issues:
1. In the first `if` block, where `max_allowed` is set based on `current_line.depth`, the condition should be `if current_line.depth > 0` instead of `if current_line.depth == 0`. This ensures that `max_allowed` is set to 2 when the depth is greater than 0.
2. In the loop that pops elements from `self.previous_defs`, the logic for setting `before` to 1 or 2 based on `depth` is incorrect. Instead, `before = 1 if depth else 2` should be outside the loop.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition in the first `if` block to set `max_allowed` correctly based on `current_line.depth`.
2. Correct the logic inside the loop that pops elements from `self.previous_defs` to properly set `before` based on the `depth`.
3. Ensure that the logic for setting `before` and `newlines` based on different conditions is accurate and covers all scenarios as per the intended behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth > 0:  # Update condition to set max_allowed correctly
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    for _ in range(len(self.previous_defs)):
        popped_depth = self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if popped_depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above modifications, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test scenarios.
