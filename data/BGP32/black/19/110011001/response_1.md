### Bug analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect results and failing tests.

1. In the first part of the function, the variable `max_allowed` is set based on the depth of the current line. If the depth is 0, `max_allowed` is set to 2; otherwise, it remains 1. This logic seems incorrect as it should handle different cases based on whether the current line is a decorator, def, class, flow control, import, or yield statement.
   
2. After processing the depth logic, the function checks if the current line is a decorator, def, or class. If it is, then based on certain conditions, it calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted. However, there are multiple branches in this section that return different results without proper synchronization.

3. The implementation has issues like reassigning the `before` variable multiple times without proper conditions and inconsistent handling based on line types.

### Bug fixing strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to revisit the logic and ensure that the conditions and branching handle different cases correctly. The function should correctly calculate the necessary number of empty lines to be inserted based on the current line type and depth. We need to refactor the function to have clear, non-overlapping transitions between different scenarios.

### Corrected version of the function
Based on the analysis and bug fixing strategy, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines += 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version aims to provide a more structured and cohesive approach to handling different line types and calculating the number of empty lines accurately. It ensures that the function behaves consistently and returns the expected values for the given inputs.
