### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is supposed to return the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the current line based on certain conditions.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the current line type, depth, and previous lines to determine the number of empty lines.
3. The function seems to have a bug where it incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to insert before and after the current line in some cases.
4. The bug might be related to the handling of previous definitions and the logic surrounding the insertion of empty lines.
5. The failing test output shows a mismatch in the expected and actual number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Bug Cause
The bug is possibly due to the incorrect handling of the `self.previous_defs` list and the logic around determining the number of newlines to insert based on various conditions. In particular, the logic inside the `while` loop where `self.previous_defs` is modified seems to be causing the bug. The function may not be correctly updating the `before` variable based on the depth of the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions and the depth of the current line.
2. Check the logic around the insertion of newlines based on the current line type, depth, and previous line properties.
3. Make sure to correctly handle the case where the current line is a decorator or a flow control statement, and adjust the newline insertion accordingly.
4. Double-check the conditions related to imports, yields, and other specific cases to ensure correct newline insertion.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed successfully.
