### Analysis
The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has several condition checks based on the type of the current line, previous lines, decorators, imports, etc. The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before and after some specific types of lines.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function is calculating the number of newlines needed before and after a line of code based on various conditions. In some cases, the calculation of the number of newlines is incorrect, leading to incorrect formatting.

In the failing test case, the expected number of newlines differs from the actual number. This causes the assertion error because the actual output does not match the expected output, leading to a failed test.

The error can be traced back to the logic for determining the number of newlines needed before and after different types of lines. It appears that the logic for handling certain line types or conditions is not correctly implemented, resulting in incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to review the conditional logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that it correctly calculates the number of newlines needed before and after each line based on the context and line type. We should pay close attention to the conditions related to different line types, decorators, imports, and flow control statements.

We will need to adjust the logic and conditions to accurately determine the number of newlines required in each scenario. This may involve updating conditions, adding new checks, or modifying existing calculations.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if (
        current_line.is_decorator
        or current_line.is_def
        or current_line.is_class
    ):
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we have simplified the logic for calculating the number of newlines needed before and after each line. The conditions have been adjusted to ensure the correct placement of newlines based on different scenarios. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
