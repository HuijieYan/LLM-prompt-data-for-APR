### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. In the function, the logic is incorrect, especially when handling the condition related to decorators and flow control. This leads to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines to insert in the output, causing test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. We should also ensure that the logic for updating `previous_defs` is consistent with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update previous_defs
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    # Handle decorators
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Handle flow control
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Handle imports and yields
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the function, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, and line depths. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
