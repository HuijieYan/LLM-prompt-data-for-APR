### Analysis:
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.
- The function processes different cases based on the type of the current line, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields, to determine the required number of empty lines.
- The function modifies the `before` variable to calculate the number of empty lines needed before the line.
- The bug seems to be related to the computation of the number of empty lines required before the current line, as indicated by the assertion error in the failing test.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the computation of the `before` variable in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue arises when the condition to set `before` to 1 or 2 is triggered within the `while` loop. This leads to incorrect calculations for the required number of empty lines before the current line.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of setting the `before` variable within the `while` loop. Instead of explicitly setting `before = 1 if depth else 2`, we should separate this assignment from the loop and only update the `before` variable based on the condition of `depth` after the loop exits.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if depth:
        before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By separating the assignment of `before` based on the condition of `depth` outside the `while` loop, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated before the current line, fixing the bug.
