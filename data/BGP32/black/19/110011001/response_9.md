### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on specific conditions defined within the function. The function takes a `current_line` parameter of type `Line` and calculates the required number of empty lines based on various attributes of the `current_line` and its relationship with other lines within the context of the code.

### Identified Bug
The bug seems to be related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines needed between specific types of code blocks or statements. Specifically, the cases where decorators, imports, and yields are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect empty line calculations.

### Bug Cause
1. In cases where `is_decorator` is `True`, the condition check for `is_decorator` within the block is causing premature return statements resulting in incorrect values being returned.
2. The handling of previous lines being decorators, imports, or yields is not accurately determining the number of empty lines needed and is leading to discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` are properly checked and handled to calculate the correct number of empty lines needed.
2. Adjust the logic to consider the previous line states accurately and compute the empty lines based on the context of the current and previous lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the mentioned adjustments in the corrected version, the function should now accurately calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, resolving the bug and ensuring the tests pass successfully.
