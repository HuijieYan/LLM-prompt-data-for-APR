### Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to handle determining the number of empty lines needed before and after a line based on certain conditions. However, there are some logical issues with the function that are causing it to return incorrect values.

1. In Case 1, when the `current_line` is a decorator, the condition to check if it is a decorator is incorrect. It should be:
   ```python
   if current_line.is_decorator:
   ```
   This will ensure that the correct block of code is executed for lines that are decorators.

2. In Case 2 and Case 3, when the function is checking for specific line types (e.g., imports, yields), the logic to handle these cases may be incorrect. The function is not properly accounting for the different scenarios and returning incorrect values.

3. In Case 7, when the `current_line` is a definition (like a function definition), the function is not correctly handling the case where empty lines should be inserted before the definition. The logic to handle this scenario needs to be revised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following points should be addressed:
- Ensure that the correct conditions are checked to determine the line type and handle it accordingly.
- Make sure that the correct actions are taken based on the line type, considering the different scenarios that may arise.
- Update the logic to properly handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted before or after a line based on its type.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Updated version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the function with the correct checks and handling for different line types, the corrected version should now return the expected number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the given conditions.
