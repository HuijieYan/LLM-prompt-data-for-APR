### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It handles various scenarios based on the properties of the current line (`current_line`) and the previous line (`previous_line`).

The bug seems to be related to how the function calculates and handles the insertion of empty lines. The incorrect behavior results in discrepancies between the expected and actual output, leading to failing tests.

#### Potential Error Locations
1. The logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line appears to be incorrect.
2. The handling of different scenarios, such as decorators, imports, yield statements, and flow control statements, might not be properly accounted for.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect assignment of values and conditions within the function. Specific issues include:
1. Incorrectly handling the number of allowed empty lines before the current line based on its depth.
2. Inconsistencies between the insertion of empty lines for decorators, imports, yield statements, and flow control statements.
3. The update of `before` and `newlines` variables likely leads to incorrect calculations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, consider the following steps:
1. Review the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the current line based on its properties and context.
2. Ensure that the logic accurately handles different scenarios such as decorators, imports, yield statements, and flow control statements.
3. Debug specific sections of the function that are responsible for determining the number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import):
        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators or after imports.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    if depth == 0:
        # Limit the number of empty lines based on the depth of the current line.
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic flow and fixing the conditions for inserting empty lines, this corrected version aims to address the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected output.
