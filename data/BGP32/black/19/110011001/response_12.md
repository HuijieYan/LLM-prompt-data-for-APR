### Bug Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, based on certain conditions related to the line's content and context. However, the function is returning incorrect values in some scenarios, leading to failing tests. 

After analyzing the runtime values and types, we can see that the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines needed based on the conditions provided. The calculations for `before` and `newlines` are erroneous under certain conditions, causing the incorrect output.

### Bug Cause
1. In Case 2, `is_decorator` is `False`, but the function prematurely returns `0, 0` when it should handle the case differently.
2. In Case 8, when `current_line.depth` is not 0, `max_allowed` is set to 1, leading to incorrect calculations.

### Bug Fix
1. For the fix, we need to adjust the conditions for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Update the condition for setting `max_allowed` based on `current_line.depth`.
3. Include appropriate checks for different scenarios for precise empty line calculations.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By correcting the conditions for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line and ensuring accurate adjustments based on the context of the code, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now provide the correct output and pass the failing tests.
