### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions related to the input `current_line` object and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object. However, there are multiple issues within the function that need to be addressed:

1. Incorrect handling of `before` variable: The modification of the `before` variable within the while loop doesn't consider the initial value of the `before` variable, leading to incorrect results.
2. Incorrect assignment of `newlines` variable: The condition for assigning the `newlines` value when `is_decorator` is True is incorrect and could lead to wrong results.
3. Inconsistencies with handling empty lines: The function doesn't consistently apply the rules regarding the insertion of empty lines, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for modifying the `before` variable to correctly handle the condition and preserve the initial value throughout the loop.
2. Revise the condition for assigning the `newlines` variable to ensure that empty lines are inserted accurately.
3. Ensure that the rules for inserting empty lines are consistently applied according to the specific conditions.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By applying the bug-fix strategy outlined above and updating the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the corrected version, the function should now work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
