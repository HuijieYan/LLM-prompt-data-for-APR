### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class but is not indented correctly within the class definition, resulting in it being recognized as a standalone function.
2. The function aims to calculate the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
3. The buggy function has multiple conditions and checks the properties of the current line to determine the number of empty lines needed.
4. The bug may arise due to incorrect handling of depth, conditions for decorators, imports, and yielding statements.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for calculating empty lines before and after the line is correctly implemented according to the specified conditions.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = len(first_leaf.prefix.splitlines())
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By correcting the indentations and making sure the logic to calculate the number of empty lines before and after the line is interpreted correctly, the buggy function should now work as intended and pass the failing test cases.
