### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class is related to the logic for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function fails to handle some cases correctly, leading to incorrect results.

1. In Case 2, the function incorrectly returns 0 newlines when the condition for inserting empty lines between decorators is met. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
2. In Case 3, the function incorrectly returns 0 newlines when the condition for inserting empty lines before a line with decorators is met. Again, this leads to a mismatch in the output.
3. In Case 6, the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to be inserted based on the depth of the current line, which leads to an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the conditions for inserting newlines based on the type of line and its context. Specifically, we should ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned in each scenario to match the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified in the test cases provided and ensure that the output matches the expected results.
