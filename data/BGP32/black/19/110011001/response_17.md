### Issue:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The logic inside the function is not correctly handling the scenarios where empty lines should be inserted or skipped.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not properly handle the case when there are previous definitions at the same depth as the current line. It should only pop the previous definitions until it reaches a level lower than the current depth.
2. The function does not correctly set the number of newlines when the current line is a decorator or a definition.
3. The function does not handle the case of avoiding empty lines between decorators or before the first line in the file.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to pop previous definitions correctly until a lower depth is reached.
2. Update the logic for determining the number of newlines when the current line is a decorator or a definition.
3. Include conditions to avoid inserting empty lines between decorators and before the first line in the file.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1

        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1

            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now properly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It should address the issues that were causing the failing tests.
