### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It handles different conditions based on the line properties like being a decorator, definition, flow control, etc. The function maintains `self.previous_defs` to keep track of previous definitions' depth levels.

#### Issues
1. In Case 7, when checking for decorators or definitions, the function updates `self.previous_defs` incorrectly. The condition should be `if depth and not is_decorator:` to ensure correct updating.
2. In Case 8, the calculation for `before` and `max_allowed` isn't consistent. The function should adjust `before` properly when `depth == 0` to cater to the correct insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Change the condition in updating `self.previous_defs` to correctly reflect decorator or definition conditions.
2. Adjust `before` correctly when `depth == 0` to insert empty lines appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth and not current_line.is_decorator:  # Fix: Update condition for updating previous_defs
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the suggested modifications, the corrected function should handle the cases correctly and pass the failing tests.
