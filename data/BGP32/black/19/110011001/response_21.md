### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has several conditions to handle different scenarios based on the type of the current line.

However, there are several issues in the function that are leading to failing tests:
1. The calculation of `before` is not correctly updated in some cases, leading to incorrect values being returned.
2. The logic for handling decorators, `is_decorator`, is flawed and needs adjustment.
3. The logic for determining newlines in specific scenarios is incorrect, leading to unexpected output.
4. The handling of `is_yield` and `is_import` conditions is not properly implemented.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` calculation is correctly updated based on the conditions specified for each scenario.
2. Adjust the logic for decorators to handle cases where decorators are present and maintain appropriate empty line insertion.
3. Correct the logic for calculating newlines in different scenarios such as when the line is a flow control or import statement.
4. Review and fix the handling of `is_yield` and `is_import` conditions to produce the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        if depth:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now calculate the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line, addressing the issues that caused the failing tests.
