### Bug Explanation
The bug is in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, specifically in the logic where it determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line in the code. The function contains several conditions for different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, etc.). However, there is inconsistency in handling the logic for inserting empty lines in some cases, causing the function to incorrectly compute the number of empty lines.

### Bug Location
The main issue lies in the inconsistent handling of conditions within the function. The logic around checking for decorators and determining the number of newlines to insert before and after them does not handle all cases correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` correctly handles all the different types of lines and decorators, determining the appropriate number of empty lines to insert. This involves correcting the logic around decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

### Updated and Corrected Function
Here is the updated and corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By correcting the logic and ensuring consistent handling of different cases, the fixed function should now compute the correct number of empty lines to insert before and after each line in the code. This will resolve the issue highlighted in the failing tests.
