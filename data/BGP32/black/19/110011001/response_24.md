### Analysis:
The `maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has several conditional branches to handle different scenarios based on the properties of the `current_line` object and its relationship with previous lines.

From the runtime values and types of variables provided, it seems like the function is not correctly handling the cases involving the addition of empty lines. The function is supposed to adjust the number of empty lines based on certain conditions but is not doing so effectively, leading to failing tests due to incorrect output.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation and adjustment of the variables `before` and `newlines` based on the conditions specified in the function. It appears that the logic for adding or removing empty lines is not working as intended, causing incorrect output and failing tests.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for adjusting the number of empty lines before and after the current line is correctly implemented based on the conditions provided. We should focus on the conditional branches that determine whether to add or remove empty lines and make appropriate adjustments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By ensuring that the conditional branches adjust the empty line count correctly based on the conditions provided, the corrected version should now provide the expected output and pass the failing tests.
