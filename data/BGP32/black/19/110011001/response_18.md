The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has some logical issues that are causing the failing test cases. The main problem lies in the logic of determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function does not handle the case where the `current_line.is_decorator` is `True` but the `self.previous_line` is not `None`. This results in incorrect insertion of empty lines.
2. The condition for `if not is_decorator:` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
3. The logic for setting `newlines` when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True` is incorrect, leading to unexpected empty line insertions.
4. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines needed are not accurately defined, causing the function to return incorrect values in some cases.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary conditions and simplify the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
2. Update the conditions to handle different scenarios like decorators, imports, flow controls, and yields accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    # fixed function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line:
                if self.previous_line.is_decorator or (current_line.depth and not self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                    return 0, 0
            return 1, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return 1, 0

        return 0, 0
```

By making these corrections, the function should now accurately determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line, resolving the issues with the failing test cases.
