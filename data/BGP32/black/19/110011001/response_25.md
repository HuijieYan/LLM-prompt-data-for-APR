### Bug Analysis:
The bug resides in the logic of determining the number of empty lines to be added before and after the currently processed line in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. There are inconsistencies in the logic flow for different conditions, leading to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines needed.

1. In the current implementation, the condition where `is_decorator` is `True` is causing issues. The code attempts to handle decorators separately but fails to consider all cases.

2. The logic for handling certain identifiers like `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield` is also incorrect, leading to incorrect calculations for empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on different conditions. The conditions for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields need to be corrected to ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned.

### Updated and Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = len(first_leaf.prefix.split("\n")) - 1 if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version incorporates the necessary fixes to handle each condition correctly and return the accurate number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
