### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function emerges due to the inconsistency in handling the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions. The most critical issue is the mismanagement of the `newlines` variable, which incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Analysis
1. The function utilizes the `newlines` variable to calculate the number of empty lines to be inserted.
2. In several if-conditions, the function sets `newlines` to 2 initially, and then based on subsequent conditions, might reduce it by 1.
3. However, each return statement does not consistently handle the `newlines` value, potentially leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `newlines` variable correctly represents the number of empty lines to insert based on the defined conditions. This can be achieved by explicitly assigning the correct values to `newlines` in each return statement.

### Corrected Function
```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if not current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function explicitly handles the `newlines` variable in each return statement, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the defined conditions.
