### Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. In Case 1, the condition `if current_line.is_import:` is problematic as there is no attribute `is_import` in the `current_line` object.
2. In Case 2, the check `if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:` might not be accurately determining the category of the line.
3. In Case 3, a similar issue to Case 1 arises where there is no defined attribute `is_import` in the `current_line` object.
4. In Case 4, the condition `if current_line.is_import:` fails due to the absence of an `is_import` attribute in the `current_line` object.
5. In Case 5, once again, the condition `if current_line.is_import:` shows a false attribute reference as `is_import` is not defined in the `current_line` object.
6. In Case 6, the instance `is_yield` in the conditions is not properly handled as it is not a property of the `current_line` object.
7. In Case 7, the statement `self.previous_defs.append(depth)` might add a value that could cause incorrect behavior in subsequent iterations.
8. In Case 8, the logic related to the condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:` appears to be flawed as it may not correctly identify decorator lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the function to properly handle category identification of lines.
2. Make sure to utilize the correct attributes of the `current_line` object to avoid attribute referencing issues.
3. Modify the `is_import` check to align with the actual properties of the `current_line` object.
4. Revisit the logic for handling `is_yield` instances to ensure correct behavior.
5. Implement a proper strategy to manage the `previous_defs` list to prevent incorrect data affecting subsequent operations.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.leaves[0].value == '@'  # Assuming decoration check based on first leaf value
    if is_decorator or current_line.leaves[0].value == 'def' or current_line.leaves[0].value == 'class':
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.leaves[0].value == '@':
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.leaves[0].value in ['if', 'else', 'elif', 'for', 'while', 'try', 'except']:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves[0].value == 'import'
        and not current_line.leaves[0].value == 'import'
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves[0].value == 'yield'
        and (current_line.leaves[0].value != 'yield' or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the adjustments as suggested above, the corrected function should be able to address the bugs identified in the original implementation.
