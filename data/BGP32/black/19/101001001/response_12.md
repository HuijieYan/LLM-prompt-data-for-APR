The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function relates to how empty lines are handled based on different conditions. The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various criteria such as depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug occurs when deciding whether to insert empty lines before the current line based on the previous line's characteristics. The function checks if the previous line is considered an import or a yield, and then sets the number of empty lines accordingly. However, there is an issue in how the `is_import` and `is_yield` checks are implemented.

The function tries to access `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes directly on the `previous_line` object, but these attributes are not defined within the `Line` class itself. Instead, the function should be calling the `is_import` function defined in the same file to correctly determine if the previous line is an import or if it yielded.

To fix the bug, the function should call the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions explicitly to check if the conditions are true for the previous line. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the attributes are not available by setting default values to those conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_prev_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
    is_prev_line_yield = is_yield(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_prev_line_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_prev_line_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function directly calls the `is_import` and `is_yield` functions to determine if the previous line is an import or if it yielded. This ensures that the correct conditions are checked, and default values are provided if the attributes are not present in the `Line` class. This fix should resolve the bug and make the function behave as intended.
