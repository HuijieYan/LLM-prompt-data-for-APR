### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug related to the logic for handling the `self.previous_defs` list. The purpose of the function is to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. In the buggy logic, there is a loop that iterates over previous definitions stored in `self.previous_defs` to determine the number of empty lines to insert, but it has inaccuracies in updating the `before` variable.

1. The loop condition `while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:` should be correct in theory, but it doesn't handle the situation where `self.previous_defs[-1]` is actually equal to `depth`.

2. Inside the loop, the lines `before = 1 if depth else 2` and `return before, 0` do not update the `before` variable based on the condition given. This results in incorrect values for `before` when a new line is inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should consider updating the logic inside the loop that handles `self.previous_defs` to accurately calculate the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. Specifically, we need to address the issues mentioned above by properly updating the `before` variable based on the conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        if self.previous_defs[-1] == depth:
            before = 1
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes the necessary changes to ensure the accurate calculation of the `before` variable during the loop iteration of `self.previous_defs`.
