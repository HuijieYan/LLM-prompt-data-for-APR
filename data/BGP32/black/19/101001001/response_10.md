### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs due to improper handling of when to insert empty lines in the code. The function is designed to determine whether to add empty lines before the current line based on specific conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, and yields. However, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to insert is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely in the calculation of `newlines` and in the if conditions that check for imports and yields.

### Bug Cause
1. In the current implementation, the `newlines` variable is set to 2 initially, then decremented by 1 if the current line has depth. However, the logic for setting `newlines` based on decorators, defs, and classes is not properly handled.
   
2. The conditional check for imports and yields at the end of the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the depth of the lines and previous line attributes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for setting the `newlines` variable based on decorators, defs, and classes to ensure correct empty line insertion.
   
2. Fix the conditional checks for imports and yields to accurately determine the number of empty lines required.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected code, the logic for setting `newlines` is adjusted correctly and the conditional checks for imports and yields are fixed to handle the correct number of empty lines insertion.
