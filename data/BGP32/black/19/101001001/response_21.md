### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function when determining the number of empty lines to insert based on different conditions related to the current line and the previous line. The issue arises specifically in the following conditions:
1. When the current line is a method decorator, class, or function definition, the function incorrectly inserts 2 newlines instead of the expected 1 newline in some cases.
2. When the current line follows an import statement and does not contain an import statement itself, the function fails to insert the required number of newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect newline counts in the mentioned conditions. We should adjust the logic to insert the correct number of empty lines based on the relationships between different types of lines. Specifically, we should ensure that only one empty line is inserted in the scenarios described above.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the function to adjust the newline counts in the mentioned cases, the corrected version should now handle the scenarios correctly and insert the appropriate number of empty lines based on the context.
