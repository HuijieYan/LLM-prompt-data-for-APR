### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the condition checking for `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`. The function tries to determine whether to return empty lines based on specific conditions surrounding imports, but the issue lies in the comparison between the attributes `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`. 

Within the buggy function, there is a check: 
```python
self.previous_line.is_import
```
This check is meant to identify if the previous line was an import statement, but the function mistakenly calls an attribute `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` instead of directly checking `current_line.is_import`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison to correctly evaluate `current_line.is_import` for the current line being analyzed rather than calling the `is_import` function. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug resolved:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the condition related to import statements based on the correct attribute `current_line.is_import`.
