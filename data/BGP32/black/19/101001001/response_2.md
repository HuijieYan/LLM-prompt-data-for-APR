### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the way it handles the condition to determine the number of newlines to return. The function has multiple conditional statements based on the type of the current line and the previous line. One critical issue is related to checking if the `is_import` attribute of the previous line, which should be done by calling the `is_import` function from a different class rather than directly accessing the attribute.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect check `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function. This mistake leads to incorrect evaluation of whether the previous line is an import line, affecting the decisions made within the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to call the `is_import` function correctly on the previous line rather than accessing the attribute directly. This will ensure the correct behavior in determining if the previous line is an import line.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):  # Corrected is_import call
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected is_import call
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In the corrected version, the function now correctly calls the `is_import` function on the `self.previous_line` to determine if it is an import line, ensuring the bug is fixed and the function behaves as expected.
