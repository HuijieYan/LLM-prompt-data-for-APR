### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises when determining the number of newlines to insert based on the current line's properties and the previous line's properties. In some cases, the logic for inserting empty lines is not handled correctly, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, before
        
        newlines = 2
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, before
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
        
    return before, 0
```

By reviewing the logic and considering various edge cases, the corrected version of the function should now handle the empty line insertion correctly based on the relationships between different types of code lines.
