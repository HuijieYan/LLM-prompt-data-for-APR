### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions like the depth of the line, previous definitions, decorators, flow control statements, import statements, and yield statements.

### Identified Issues
1. The condition for initializing `newlines` is not correctly set based on decorators and previous lines.
2. Incorrect handling of `self.previous_line.is_import` in the conditional check.
3. Inconsistent usage of `before` and absence of returning values for the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the condition for calculating `newlines` based on decorators and previous lines.
2. Correct the conditional statement involving `self.previous_line.is_import`.
3. Ensure that the function consistently uses `before` to determine the number of empty lines and returns the appropriate values.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the issues related to the calculation of `newlines` and checking for imports have been resolved to improve the function's behavior based on the provided runtime scenarios.
