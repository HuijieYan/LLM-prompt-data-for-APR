The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug related to handling empty lines before certain types of lines (decorators, definitions, classes, etc.). The bug can be identified by the incorrect calculation of the number of newlines required before these specific types of lines. The bug causes incorrect spacing in the output, leading to incorrect code formatting.

### Bug Analysis:
1. In the buggy function, the logic for handling empty lines before specific types of lines is flawed. The function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines required based on the line type and the previous line type.
2. The `before` variable meant to determine the number of newlines before a line is calculated within various conditional blocks but not consistently.
3. The conditions for handling different line types are not properly structured, leading to unexpected results in determining the number of newlines before certain lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the logic for determining the number of newlines before different types of lines is correctly implemented.
2. Adjust the conditions and calculations for `before` based on the line types and previous line types.
3. Simplify the logic to make it easier to understand and maintain.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the conditions and calculations within the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the spacing issues related to different line types should be resolved, and the function should now produce the correct number of newlines before specific types of lines as intended.
