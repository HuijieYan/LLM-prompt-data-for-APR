### Issue:
The bug is related to the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that incorrectly handles the decision-making process for inserting empty lines based on different conditions related to the current and previous lines.

### Root Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of the `before` variable. In some cases, `before` is calculated and returned correctly, but in other cases, it is not updated properly. This inconsistency leads to incorrect decisions for inserting empty lines.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is set correctly in all relevant scenarios based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if not depth else 1
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the `before` variable is consistently updated based on the conditions in the function, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are inserted as needed.
