### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is incorrectly handling the condition for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before a line of code. The issue arises from the comparison between the `self.previous_line` and the current `current_line` object's attributes (like `is_import`, `is_yield`, etc.). The check `self.previous_line.is_import` does not work as intended because the `is_import` function is being called as an attribute instead of a function on `self.previous_line`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function correctly on the `self.previous_line` object and compare the result with the appropriate attribute of the current `current_line` object. Additionally, we need to ensure that the conditions are properly evaluated to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert before the line of code.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call the is_import function correctly
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code above, the function `is_import` is correctly called as a function on `self.previous_line`, ensuring that the comparison with `current_line.is_import` works as expected. This update should resolve the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before the line of code based on the specified conditions.
