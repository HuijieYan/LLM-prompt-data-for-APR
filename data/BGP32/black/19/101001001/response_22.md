### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the conditions and the logic for adding empty lines. The function is intended to determine the number of empty lines to add before the current line based on certain rules and conditions related to the type of the current line, the previous line, and other variables.

From the runtime values and types of variables provided, we can observe that in Case 3, where the current line is considered a decorator, the function incorrectly sets the `is_decorator` flag to `True` and calculates `newlines` as 2, despite not being consistent with the conditions specified in the code.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the conditions related to decorators to ensure that `is_decorator` is set correctly based on the line type.
2. Correct the calculation of the number of newlines to be added by considering the depth of the current line.
3. Review the logic for handling different line types to align with the intended behavior specified in the code.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the condition for decorators and the calculation of newlines based on the depth of the current line, the function should now behave as expected and avoid the bug observed in Case 3.
