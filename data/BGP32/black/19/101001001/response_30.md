The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the logic related to handling the insertion of empty lines. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line based on various conditions. However, the bug causes inconsistencies in the decision-making process, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Issues Identified:
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` value: The evaluations of `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of the `current_line` seem to be inconsistent. This inconsistency might lead to improper calculations of `newlines` value.
   
2. Conditional checks leading to incorrect returns: The conditions for returning the number of empty lines are not structured properly, which could result in unexpected behavior during runtime.
   
3. Inaccurate management of `before` value: The manipulation and assignment of the `before` variable inside the while loop and other conditional blocks could lead to incorrect values being set for the number of empty lines before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `max_allowed` value is calculated consistently based on the depth of the `current_line`.
   
2. Refactor the conditional checks to ensure that the correct cases are being handled accurately and the appropriate return values are being provided.
   
3. Properly manage the `before` value to reflect the actual number of empty lines before the current line based on the defined conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues and should now provide the correct number of empty lines before the current line based on the defined conditions and inputs.
