### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly handling the logic related to determining the number of newlines before the current line. The issue is primarily around the conditions that check for various cases like decorators, flow control, imports, etc., and calculate the number of newlines based on those conditions. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the conditions that determine the number of newlines before the current line based on the requirements for each case.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling previous definitions, decorators, flow control, imports, and yielding is correctly implemented.
3. Check the order of the conditions to make sure that more specific cases are handled before more general ones.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Correction Made:
1. Rearranged the conditions to address specific cases before general cases.
2. Adjusted the way newlines are calculated for different scenarios such as decorators, flow control, imports, etc.
3. Improved handling of the previous definitions, decorators, and specific scenarios.

By following the updated corrected function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should now work correctly based on the given test cases and conditions.
