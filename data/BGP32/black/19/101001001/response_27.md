### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the condition for handling empty lines when the current line is a decorator, a function definition, or a class definition. The function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to add based on the previous line's properties and the current line's properties. There are issues with how `is_decorator` is checked and how the newlines are calculated, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. In the existing code, the logic for detecting decorators is problematic. We need to ensure that we correctly identify decorators to handle them separately from other conditions.
2. Evaluate the condition for checking if the current line is a decorator, function definition, or class definition and set the variables accordingly to add newlines correctly.
3. Update the logic to calculate the correct number of newlines based on the current line's properties and the previous line's properties.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't insert empty lines before decorators or between decorators.
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version improves the detection of decorators, function definitions, and class definitions, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the context of the current line and the previous line.
