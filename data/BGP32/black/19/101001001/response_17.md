### Analysis
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` operates based on certain conditions of the `current_line` passed to it.
2. It modifies the `before` value based on specific conditions and returns a tuple representing the number of empty lines to insert before and after the `current_line`.
3. Cases seem to handle different scenarios such as decorators, definitions, flow control, imports, and yields.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be primarily related to how the `before` value is updated and used throughout the function. In multiple conditional branches, the `before` value is calculated and updated, but in some cases, it is overridden unexpectedly. This leads to incorrect handling of the number of empty lines to insert in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value is consistently updated and used correctly according to the conditions defined in the function. We should track this value properly and make sure it retains the correct number of empty lines to insert before the `current_line`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `before` value is consistently handled and updated according to the requirements of each conditional branch. This should ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted before the `current_line` based on the conditions specified.
