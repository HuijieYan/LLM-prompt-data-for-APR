### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when determining the number of empty lines to insert based on certain conditions. The logic for handling empty lines before and after expressions, definitions, and decorators is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior in some cases. This is especially evident in cases involving decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after different types of code elements. We should ensure that the handling of empty lines aligns with standard Python formatting rules.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class or current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        if current_line.is_decorator:
            return newlines, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_import:
            return 0, 0

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function:
- We have simplified the logic for handling definitions, classes, and decorators to follow standard Python formatting conventions.
- We ensured that empty lines are not inserted before the first line in a file and between decorators.
- Proper checks are now in place for different scenarios to decide the number of empty lines to insert.

This fix should address the identified bug and make the function behave correctly based on the input conditions.
