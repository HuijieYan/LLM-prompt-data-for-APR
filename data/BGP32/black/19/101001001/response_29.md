### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for handling the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue occurs when determining the number of empty lines to insert between two lines based on their properties such as being imports, yields, or flow control statements. The logic to return the appropriate number of empty lines is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Potential Error Location
The bug is likely in the conditional branches where the function decides how many empty lines to insert based on various conditions such as whether the current line is a decorator, a def statement, a class, a flow control statement, an import, or a yield statement. The issue could also be with the handling of `before` value and the calculations involving it.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the conditions that determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. In some cases, the logic used to decide whether to insert empty lines or not, or how many empty lines to insert, is flawed. This leads to inconsistencies in the expected behavior of the function based on the properties of the current and previous lines.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that each conditional branch correctly calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on the properties of the current line and the previous line. We must also pay attention to the correct handling of `before` value and its modifications throughout the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I've focused on ensuring that the calculations for the number of empty lines to insert in various scenarios are correct and accurately reflect the expected behavior based on the current and previous line properties.
