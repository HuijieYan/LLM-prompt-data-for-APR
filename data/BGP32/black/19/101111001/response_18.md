### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of conditions to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted in specific scenarios. One crucial issue is the misuse of the `before` variable, which is calculated based on different conditions but sometimes not correctly used to determine the number of empty lines.

In Case 8, when the `current_line` is not a decorator or a def/class block, the function incorrectly returns `before` as the number of empty lines instead of using it together with `newlines` to determine the correct result.

Moreover, the conditions for handling decorators, imports, and yields are flawed leading to incorrect empty lines insertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Ensure that the `newlines` and `before` variables are utilized correctly to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted.
2. Adjust conditions for decorators, imports, and yields to handle empty lines insertion accurately.
3. Consider the special cases when certain blocks should not have empty lines inserted.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in these areas, the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the specified conditions, leading to the passing of the failing test.
