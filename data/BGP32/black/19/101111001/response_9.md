### Bug Analysis
The bug lies in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where the conditions for handling newlines before specific constructs like decorators, definitions (`def`), classes, imports, and flow control statements are not correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines, especially when the previous line was an import statement. The bug causes the failing test scenario where the expected and actual formatted code differs, as seen from the assertion error.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function handles conditions for different types of lines, like decorators, definitions, classes, imports, and flow control statements.
2. Incorrect logic within these conditions leads to inappropriate handling of empty lines insertion, especially in scenarios with imports.
3. In the failing test, we have a scenario involving comments within decorators where the empty line insertion is not appropriately handled, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual formatted code.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the conditions within the function related to handling newlines before specific constructs.
2. Ensure that the logic for empty line insertion is correctly implemented for each scenario, particularly for import statements.
3. Update the function to address the bug while considering the defined behavior for different types of lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import:
            if depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and not current_line.is_yield
        and depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1 if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic within `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly handle empty line insertion before different types of constructs, especially imports, the bug is fixed. Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test scenario.
