### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the formatting of empty lines based on various conditions related to the current and previous lines. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is showing an assertion error due to the incorrect insertion of additional empty lines in the output.

#### Observations:
1. The function checks various conditions like decorators, classes, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to determine the number of empty lines to insert.
2. The issue mainly arises from the handling of decorators, imports, and yield statements, where the determination of newlines is not accurate based on the previous and current line properties.
3. The incorrect handling of these conditions leads to unnecessary empty lines being inserted, causing a mismatch with the expected output in the failing test case.
4. The previous line properties are crucial in making the right decision for empty line insertion.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields are correctly handled to avoid unnecessary empty line insertions.
2. Make sure that the previous line properties are accurately considered when deciding the number of newlines to insert.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle the cases where empty lines are not required based on the context of the code.
4. Validate the conditions for flow control statements and adjust the newline insertion accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis and fixing strategy:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if not self.previous_line.is_def or not self.previous_line.is_class:
            return 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        return 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic and conditions handling in the function, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
