### Bug Explanation
The bug is related to the handling of empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is responsible for determining whether to add empty lines in the formatted output based on certain conditions related to the current line and the previous lines. The bug arises when dealing with decorators, definitions, and imports, causing incorrect placement of empty lines.

In the failing test case, the error message shows a mismatch between the expected and actual output due to incorrect formatting, leading to an assertion error. This discrepancy occurs because the buggy function is not correctly handling the conditions related to decorators and their comments.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring in the conditional blocks related to decorators, definitions, and imports, where the logic for adding empty lines is not properly implemented.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the correct number of empty lines is added before decorators, definitions, and imports.
2. Modify the conditions for inserting empty lines to align with the expected formatting rules.
3. Update the logic to handle comments and decorators appropriately to achieve the desired output.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditions related to decorators, imports, and definitions, the corrected function should now properly handle empty line insertion and align with the expected formatting rules, passing the failing test cases.
