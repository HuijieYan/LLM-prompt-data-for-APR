### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to how the function `_maybe_empty_lines` handles the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before certain types of lines in the code. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates a discrepancy in the expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of empty lines.

From the runtime values and types provided, it is evident that the function does not properly handle cases where the current line is a decorator or where there are specific conditions related to imports, yields, and flow control. This leads to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines to insert, causing the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions and logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the given line and the context of the surrounding lines. Specifically, we need to ensure that the handling of decorators, imports, yields, and flow control lines is done correctly to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line.is_decorator
        or (self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class)
        or (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth)
        or (self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth))
    ):
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version modifies the logic to handle decorators, imports, yields, flow control, and other line types more accurately, ensuring the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions specified in the function.
