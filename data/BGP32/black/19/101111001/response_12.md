### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of the conditions that determine the number of newlines to insert before a line. There are several conditions related to different types of lines (decorators, imports, flow control, etc.) that guide the decision-making process. The bug is causing incorrect newline insertion based on these conditions, leading to formatting discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Location
The bug appears to be in the block of code where the newline count is determined based on the type of the current line and the relationship with the previous line. The conditions involving decorators, imports, and flow control are especially relevant to this bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the type of line being processed.
- Correctly handle the scenario where the previous line is a decorator to prevent empty lines between decorators.
- Properly distinguish between different types of lines (decorators, imports, flow control) for accurate newline insertion.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We have properly handled conditions related to decorators, imports, flow control, and other types of lines to determine the correct number of newlines to insert.
- We are using the `is_import` function to correctly identify import lines.
- The logic for handling decorators and the insertion of empty lines in various scenarios has been fixed.
