### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to checking whether the `self.previous_line` is an import. The function incorrectly checks `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming that the `is_import` attribute is directly accessible on `Line` objects. However, the `is_import` function used to check this is defined globally in the file and not as a method of the `Line` class. This leads to a runtime error when trying to access `is_import` directly on `self.previous_line`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should call the `is_import` function defined in the file with the `self.previous_line` as an argument instead of trying to access `is_import` directly as an attribute on `self.previous_line`.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_prev_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False

    if is_prev_line_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` we ensure that the function correctly checks if the previous line is an import, fixing the bug identified.
