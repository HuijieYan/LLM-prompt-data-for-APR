### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the mismanagement of empty lines in certain cases, specifically when handling decorators and imports. The function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on the current line, the previous line, and the depth of the code.

The bug causes incorrect handling of decorators and imports, leading to the wrong number of empty lines being inserted between the lines in the output. This results in a failed test case where the expected and actual outputs do not match due to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling decorators, imports, and the calculation of empty lines to insert based on the context of the current and previous lines. We should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the specific conditions defined in the function.

### Corrected Version

After analyzing and understanding the bug, we can provide a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the correct checks for decorators, imports, and the calculation of empty lines, the corrected version of the function should now handle these cases properly and pass the failing test mentioned.
