### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where the function is not correctly handling the case where the `previous_line` is an import. 

In the buggy code, there is a check `self.previous_line.is_import` which attempts to call the `is_import` method on the `previous_line`. However, `is_import` is defined as a separate function outside the class, and it is not accessible through `self.previous_line`.

When running the failing test, the error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of different cases like decorators, comments, and newlines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the case when checking if the `previous_line` is an import. We need to refactor this logic to use the `is_import` function defined outside the class.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_import_line = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
    if is_import_line and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By introducing a call to the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as input, we can handle the case when checking if the `previous_line` is an import correctly. This change should address the bug and help the function pass the failing test.
