### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing it to incorrectly handle the case where the current line is a decorator or a function definition (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`). The function incorrectly sets the number of newlines to be inserted based on these conditions, leading to extra or missing newlines in the output.

In the failing test case provided `test_comment_in_decorator`, the function is expected to format code containing decorators and comments correctly. However, due to the bug in handling decorators, the output differs from the expected output, causing the assertion error.

The specific faulty logic is present in the block where decorators are encountered. The function should account for decorators and adjust the number of newlines to include in the output correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic related to decorators to properly handle the insertion of empty lines in those cases. Specifically, when encountering decorators, the function needs to ensure that empty lines are inserted only when necessary and follow the correct formatting rules.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, the logic related to decorators has been adjusted to ensure that empty lines are inserted appropriately based on the specific conditions for decorators. The function now correctly handles decorators and should pass the failing test case provided.
