### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not considering the case where `current_line` is an import statement correctly. It tries to check if the previous line (`self.previous_line`) is an import statement using `self.previous_line.is_import`, but that check is not accurate because `is_import` is a separate function and not a property of the `Line` class. Due to this, the function fails to handle the correct conditional branches and makes incorrect decisions about inserting empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to replace the incorrect check `self.previous_line.is_import` with a correct one by calling the separate `is_import` function passing the `self.previous_line` as an argument. This change will accurately determine whether the previous line is an import statement or not and allow the function to follow the correct logic flow.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# Assuming the imports and function definitions are already available

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Correct check for import statement
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this correction, the function will now accurately determine whether the previous line is an import statement or not, leading to correct empty line insertion decisions.
