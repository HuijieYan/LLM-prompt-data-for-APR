### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines in Python code based on specific conditions. The bug stems from the incorrect handling of the `is_import` attribute of the `Line` objects. The function tries to check if the `current_line` is an import statement by calling `current_line.is_import`. However, there is no attribute `is_import` defined in the `Line` class. Instead, there is a separate function named `is_import` that should be called with the `current_line` as an argument to determine if it is an import statement.

Due to this incorrect attribute access, the function fails to properly identify import statements and incorrectly inserts or skips empty lines when it shouldn't, leading to output mismatches and failed test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should call the `is_import` function passing the `current_line` object as the argument to correctly determine if it is an import statement. This will ensure that the function behaves as intended and handles empty line insertion or skipping correctly based on the nature of the input code.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_line_import = is_import(current_line)  # Fix: Correctly determine if the current line is an import
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not is_line_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` now correctly calls the `is_import` function to determine if the current line is an import statement, ensuring that the correct logic is applied for handling empty lines.
