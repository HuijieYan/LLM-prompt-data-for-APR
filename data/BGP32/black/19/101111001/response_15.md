### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines and prefixes for specific cases like decorators, classes, def statements, flow control lines, and imports. The checks to determine the number of empty lines and whether to insert them seem to be incorrect based on the provided runtime input examples. 

Specifically, in the failing test case, there are issues with the expected output not matching the actual output. The function should correctly adjust the number of newline characters and prefixes based on the conditions provided, but it fails to do so in certain scenarios, resulting in incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the condition checks in the function to ensure they are correctly identifying the cases where empty lines or prefixes should be added.
2. Verify the logic for adjusting the number of newlines and prefixes based on the rules for decorators, classes, def statements, flow control lines, and imports.
3. Update the function to handle these cases correctly to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
The following corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to the function, it should now correctly handle the different cases and align with the expected output, passing the failing test cases.
