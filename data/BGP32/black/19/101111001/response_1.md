### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the properties of the current line and the previous line. The bug is triggered when the function encounters a specific scenario involving decorators and comments inside them, causing the function to miscount the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the conditional block handling decorators and the logic related to inserting empty lines. In particular, the issue arises when processing decorators and comments within them, leading to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines to add.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a line with comments inside a decorator block. This situation is not handled correctly by the existing logic, which results in incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines to insert.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic responsible for handling decorators and comments inside them. Specifically, we should ensure that comments within decorator blocks do not affect the calculation of empty lines to insert. By updating this logic, we can correctly determine the necessary number of empty lines based on the specific properties of the current and previous lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the bug and correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the line properties.
