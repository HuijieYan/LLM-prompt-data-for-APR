### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` condition check inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The issue arises because `self.previous_line` is compared against the `is_import` method, which is a function rather than a property.

When checking `self.previous_line.is_import`, the intention appears to be to call the `is_import` function defined outside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. However, due to the lack of proper context or direct access, this check fails to function correctly and leads to incorrect logic and output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to utilize the `is_import` function correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Since the `is_import` function is defined in the same file, we should consider invoking it within the correct context and passing the necessary arguments for the comparison.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I have replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to ensure that the `is_import` function is properly called within the correct context for comparison. This change resolves the bug and should make the function work correctly with the `is_import` behavior intended for the comparison.
