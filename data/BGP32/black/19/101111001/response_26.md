### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the comparison of `current_line.is_import` with `self.previous_line.is_import` to determine if there should be empty lines inserted. The issue arises from the fact that `self.previous_line.is_import` is checked directly without calling the `is_import` function defined earlier in the code which actually determines if a line is an import or not.

In each failing case provided, the bug causes incorrect handling of empty lines where imports are involved, leading to formatting differences in the output compared to the expected results, as shown by the failing tests and the error messages.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` function is correctly called to determine if a line is an import. This involves changing the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By using the `is_import` function to correctly determine if a line is an import, the corrected function should now address the bug and pass the failing tests successfully.
