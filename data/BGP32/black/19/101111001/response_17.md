### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the handling of conditions related to decorators (`is_decorator`), `def`, `class`, and import statements (`is_import`) in determining the number of newlines to insert. The bug seems to be originating from how the function handles these conditions and the order of the checks.

1. In the current code, when the current line is a decorator, `def`, or `class`, it sets `newlines` to 2 and then returns the value. This is incorrect as the function should not always return 2 newlines in these cases.

2. Another issue is with the check related to `is_import` condition, where it checks if the previous line was an import or not. The current implementation fails to properly handle this logic, leading to incorrect newline insertion.

3. The handling of `previous_defs` list and updating the `before` value within the while loop is also leading to incorrect behavior in determining the number of newlines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic related to decorators, `def`, and `class` to correctly handle the insertion of newlines based on the context of the current and previous lines.

2. Revise the conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield` to ensure correct newline insertion based on the context of the lines.

3. Correctly update the `before` value within the while loop to handle multiple definitions properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def_or_class = current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    if is_decorator or is_def_or_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or is_def_or_class:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators or def/class lines.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying these corrections, the function should now properly handle the insertion of newlines in different scenarios, and the failing test should pass successfully.
