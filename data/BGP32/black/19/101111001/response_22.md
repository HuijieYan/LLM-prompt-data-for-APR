### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have an issue when handling the case of adding empty lines in the presence of decorators and comments within decorators. The function fails to account for adding empty lines after comments within decorators, leading to incorrect formatting and causing the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function not properly handling the scenario when the previous line contains comments within a decorator and the current line is not a decorator but contains other elements. This results in an incorrect determination of the number of empty lines to be inserted after the comments within decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly handle the scenario when there are comments within decorators and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted between lines, based on the surrounding context.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import() and not current_line.is_import:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield() and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary:
By making the adjustments and logic changes as provided in the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should now correctly handle the scenario of comments within decorators and ensure that the empty lines are inserted appropriately, fixing the bug that caused the failing test case.
