### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect condition to check if the previous line is an import statement. The buggy function attempts to use `self.previous_line.is_import` to determine if the previous line is an import statement, however, `is_import` is a separate function defined outside the scope of the current class. This causes the code to fail and results in incorrect handling of empty lines between statements. The incorrect handling leads to the failing test cases observed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly check if the previous line was an import statement. Instead of relying on `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should utilize the `is_import` function defined within the same file to determine if the previous line is an import statement. By making this change, we can accurately handle empty lines between statements and ensure the correct behavior as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_import_stmt = is_import(current_line)
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import_stmt
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the condition to check if the previous line is an import statement using the `is_import` function, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle empty lines between statements correctly, resolving the failing test cases.
