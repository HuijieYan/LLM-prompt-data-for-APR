Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the runtime values provided, the bug in the function lies in the logic that handles the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions. The issue arises in determining the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted. Specifically, we need to ensure that the conditions for inserting empty lines are properly checked and handled to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the function, which should pass the failing tests:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

# Define the Line and Leaf classes for completeness
@dataclass
class Leaf:
    type: str
    value: str
    prefix: str

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: List[Leaf]
    comments: List[str]
    bracket_tracker: object
    inside_brackets: bool
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    previous_line: Line
    previous_after: int
    previous_defs: List[int]

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return 0, 1
        
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        
        return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the previous logic issues and correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the specified conditions. The function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output.
