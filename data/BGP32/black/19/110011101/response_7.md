### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic around handling empty lines in the context of decorators. The function attempts to calculate the number of empty lines needed before a line based on various conditions, such as whether the line is a decorator, class, import, etc. However, the logic for handling decorators and empty lines is incorrect, which leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect empty line counts.

Upon reviewing the provided code and the runtime values and expected values, it seems that the function does not handle the case of decorators properly. The function returns incorrect values for `newlines` when the current line is a decorator. This results in incorrect empty line counts before and after decorator lines, leading to the failed test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic of how empty lines are handled, specifically for decorator lines. We should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on whether the line is a decorator or not. We need to consider the different scenarios specified in the code and handle them accurately to pass the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that should address the bug and pass the failing tests:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line:
        if (
            self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version alters the logic for handling decorators and empty lines, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is calculated before and after decorator lines. It should address the bug and pass the failing tests.
