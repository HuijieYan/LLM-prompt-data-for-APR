## Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in how it handles the calculation of empty lines based on the characteristics of the input `current_line` and the previous line. The issue occurs when determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line, which leads to incorrect spacing in the output, causing the failing tests.

The function incorrectly sets the `before` variable to `1` or `2` based on conditions further in the code, which is not correctly adjusted in all cases. This leads to incorrect deductions of empty lines before the current line, leading to misaligned output compared to the expected result.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of the `before` variable is correctly handled in all scenarios according to the expected logic of the function. This includes adjusting how empty lines are counted and inserted based on the specific conditions related to the input `current_line` and the previous line.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function below that aligns with the expected input/output values:

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""  # Consume newlines
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 0
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring proper handling of the `before` variable depending on specific conditions and adjusting the logic for calculating empty lines before and after the current line, the corrected version should now align with the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
