### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect modification of the `before` variable in the while loop that updates the number of empty lines needed based on the `self.previous_defs`. The issue arises when setting the `before` variable back to 1 or 2 on each iteration of the while loop, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly considering the conditions inside the loop and that it is not reset to 1 or 2 on each iteration. We should set the `before` variable initially to 1 or 2 based on the `depth` condition before entering the loop and only update it based on the `self.previous_defs`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    for depth_limit in self.previous_defs[::-1]:
        if depth_limit < depth:
            break
        before += 1
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Suggestions
After updating the function, it is advisable to rerun the failing tests to ensure that the corrected version now passes all cases.
