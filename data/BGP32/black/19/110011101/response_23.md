The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic that decides the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line in the formatting process. The function is not handling the cases properly, leading to incorrect line formatting.

The bug occurs in the following line:
```python
while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
```

The bug is caused by the condition in the while loop not working as expected. It should pop elements from `self.previous_defs` until the condition becomes false. However, the logic inside the while loop is affecting the `before` variable incorrectly, causing incorrect behavior during formatting.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the while loop to pop elements from `self.previous_defs` correctly and update the `before` variable accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is correctly updated and maintains the correct logic flow for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after each line during the formatting process.
