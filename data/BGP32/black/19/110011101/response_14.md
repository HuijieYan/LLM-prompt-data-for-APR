The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from a logic issue in handling the insertion of empty lines. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, the calculation of these empty lines is incorrect in some cases, as indicated by the failing tests and the runtime values.

Based on the provided runtime and expected values, the issue arises when handling decorators with comments inside and between decorators. The function is not applying the correct logic to determine when to insert empty lines before and after such situations, leading to incorrect formatting results.

To fix the bug and ensure the expected outputs match the runtime values, here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count('\n')), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count('\n')), 0

    return max(0, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count('\n')), 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues in handling decorators and comments, ensuring that the empty lines are inserted correctly according to the expected behavior.
