## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The issue arises when determining the number of empty lines to return based on various conditions like decorators, imports, flow control, and yields. In some cases, the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to insert, leading to discrepancies between the actual and expected output of the function.

One specific problematic behavior is observed when determining the number of empty lines to return before and after the current line. This discrepancy results in failing tests that compare the expected and actual output of the function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that the logic for handling the calculation of empty lines before and after the current line is correctly implemented. Specifically, we should focus on refining the conditions and calculations that determine the number of newlines to insert based on the context of the current line.

One strategy to fix the bug is to carefully review the conditions and calculations in the function to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior for inserting empty lines before and after the current line. By making targeted adjustments to these conditions and calculations, we can align the function's output with the expected results across different scenarios.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, newlines
            elif self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, newlines
            else:
                return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function by adjusting the conditional checks and calculations to ensure the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specified conditions.
