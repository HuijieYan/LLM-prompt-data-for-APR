The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to how the variable `before` is being updated. It incorrectly updates `before` within the `while` loop, which causes unexpected behavior in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

The issue arises because within the loop, the value of `before` is being continuously reassigned without taking into account the original value. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed.

To fix the bug, we need to preserve the original value of `before` and only update it when certain conditions are met. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    original_before = before  # Preserve the original value of before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return original_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0

    return original_before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the original value of `before` is preserved and only updated in specific cases where necessary. It addresses the bug and should now pass the failing test cases provided.
