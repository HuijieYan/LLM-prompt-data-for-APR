## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by the inconsistency in the conditions for checking if empty lines should be inserted before and after the current line. The function contains conditions that are not properly handling the cases where newlines need to be added or removed based on the previous and current lines.

In case 2, the function incorrectly returns 2 newlines even though the current line is not a decorator, def, or class, leading to extra newlines being inserted when not needed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions in the function to correctly determine when newlines should be added before and after the current line. We should ensure that the logic properly handles all cases where newlines need to be considered based on the context of the code.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return max(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0
```

This corrected version takes into account various scenarios where newlines should be added or removed based on the context of the current and previous lines, ensuring that the output aligns with the expected behavior in the tests.
