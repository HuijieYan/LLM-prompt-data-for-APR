The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the handling of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function does not correctly determine the number of empty lines needed based on the line type and contents. This leads to incorrect output and failing tests.

The bug occurs in the following scenarios:
- When handling decorators, classes, or flow control statements.
- When determining the number of empty lines based on the current line and the previous line.
- Incorrect updating and manipulation of the `previous_defs` list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle each case and calculate the correct number of empty lines needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def:
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth > self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_yield:
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.depth != current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if current_line.is_import or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return 0, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues with incorrect empty line calculations and ensure that the function returns the expected output for each scenario.
