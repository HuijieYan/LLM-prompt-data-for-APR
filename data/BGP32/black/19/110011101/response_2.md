The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic used to compute the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The issue arises from not properly updating the `before` variable when updating `self.previous_defs`.

In the current implementation, when updating `self.previous_defs`, the `before` value is set to 1 if `depth` is truthy, otherwise 2. This leads to incorrect behavior especially in cases where `before` should be 0.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value is not overridden incorrectly when updating `self.previous_defs`. We can achieve this by introducing a separate variable to track the number of empty lines needed before updating `before` based on `depth`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth != 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the provided input parameters and pass the failing tests.
