### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the update of `before` variable in the while loop. The current implementation overwrites the `before` variable each time inside the loop, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
- In cases where the inner while loop is executed, the `before` variable is continuously updated depending on the depth level, which might not be the intended behavior.
- The purpose of this function is to update the number of empty lines before and after the current line. Instead of updating `before` each time in the loop, it should be updated only in specific conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should update the `before` variable only under specific conditions specified in the function's logic. This will ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned before and after the current line.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    for prev_depth in reversed(self.previous_defs):
        if prev_depth >= depth:
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The updated function ensures that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on specific conditions and not overridden unnecessarily. This should address the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected output.
