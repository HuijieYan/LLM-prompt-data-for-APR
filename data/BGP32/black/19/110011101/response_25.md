### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after a line. The issue might stem from how the previous definitions are handled, leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines.

1. The function seems to manipulate the number of empty lines before a line based on various conditions like whether the current line is a decorator, import, flow control, etc.
2. The function uses `self.previous_defs` list to keep track of previous definitions but might not be updating it correctly in all cases, which leads to incorrect decisions on inserting empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the previous definitions are handled correctly and that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after a line is consistent with the desired formatting rules.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the bug by ensuring that the previous definitions are handled properly and the logic for determining empty lines is consistent with the expected formatting rules.
