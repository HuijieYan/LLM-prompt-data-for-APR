### Bug Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, the function has a bug that causes it to return incorrect values under certain conditions. Here is a summary of the bug:

1. In cases where `current_line` is a decorator, a `def`, or a class definition, the function correctly handles the logic to determine empty lines for these cases.
2. However, in other cases like flow control, import statements, and yield statements, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines needed.
3. The bug stems from the improper handling of specific conditions and not correctly adjusting the calculations based on the requirements for each type of statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling flow control, import statements, and yield statements. This involves correctly determining the number of empty lines needed in these cases based on the surrounding context and ensuring that the calculation aligns with the expected behavior.

### Updated and Fixed Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By updating the logic based on the expected behavior of different types of statements, the fixed function should now return the correct number of potential empty lines before and after each line, passing the failing tests as indicated in the bug details.
