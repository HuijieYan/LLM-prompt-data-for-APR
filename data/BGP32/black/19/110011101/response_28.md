## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect computation and handling of newlines. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, the current implementation has issues in setting the correct number of newlines based on different conditions.

Here are the key findings:
- The `depth` value is being set according to the `current_line.depth`.
- The `max_allowed` value is governed by the `depth` and is initially set to 1 but can be updated to 2.
- The `before` value is computed by counting the newlines in the `prefix` of the first leaf.
- The function then proceeds to handle a series of conditions depending on the characteristics of the `current_line`.
- There are issues identified in the handling of newlines in decorators, flow control, imports, yields, and other scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the function's logic needs to be revised to correctly determine the number of newlines required before and after the processed line in all possible scenarios. It should consider the special cases like decorators, imports, flow controls, and yields and set the appropriate number of newlines.

Now, we will provide a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis and identified issues.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    else:
        before = 0

    if not current_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        is_previous_decorator = self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        if is_previous_decorator or self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should address the issues identified and ensure that the function behaves as expected in determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after each processed line.
