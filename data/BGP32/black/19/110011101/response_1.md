Based on the analysis provided for the buggy function, the issue lies with the calculation of the number of empty lines that should be inserted before and after the current line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is making incorrect decisions leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.

The main causes of the bugs observed are related to the conditions within the function. The function is not correctly handling cases such as decorators, import statements, and yield statements, leading to incorrect empty line computations.

To fix the bug, let's correct the logic for handling decorators, imports, and yield statements. We should also ensure that the adjustments made to `before` and the number of newlines are according to the expected behavior for the different cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By modifying the handling of decorators, imports, and yield statements, we ensure that the computation of empty lines before and after the current line is more accurate and aligned with the test cases.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases described above.
