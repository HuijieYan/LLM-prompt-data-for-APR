### Code Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on some conditions. However, there are several issues that lead to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

1. The function fails to update the `previous_line` attribute after processing a line.
2. The logic for inserting empty lines based on different conditions seems to be incorrect due to not considering all cases properly.
3. The handling of `depth` and `previous_defs` is causing incorrect computation of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the following:
1. Update the `previous_line` attribute after processing each line correctly.
2. Ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the line is correct for all cases.
3. Properly manage the `depth` and `previous_defs` attributes to maintain the correct state for empty line tracking.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth <= self.previous_line.depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating these changes into the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we aim to address the issues leading to failing tests and improve the correctness of the empty line tracking logic.
