### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line. The issue arises when handling the update of the `before` value under certain conditions, specifically related to the handling of `self.previous_defs`.

The logic for updating the `before` value is incorrect, as it is being updated to a fixed value, either 1 or 2, instead of preserving the correct value calculated based on the conditions. This leads to incorrect computation of the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to properly handle the updating of the `before` value to correctly calculate the number of empty lines based on the conditions defined in the function. This involves correctly updating the `before` value based on the conditions specified and ensuring that the logic follows the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for calculating the `before` value based on the conditions and ensuring that it reflects the correct number of empty lines needed, the corrected function should now properly handle the insertion of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
