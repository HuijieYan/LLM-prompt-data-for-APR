## Correction

### Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the calculation of the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line. The implementation is using incorrect logic for handling decorators and previous definitions. This leads to incorrect results and failing tests.

In the failing cases, the function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions provided. It is essential to handle decorators, flow control, imports, and yielding properly to ensure the correct number of empty lines.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle decorators, flow control, imports, and yielding. The correction involves restructuring the conditions and updating the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
```

### Summary
The corrected `_maybe_empty_lines` function includes proper handling for decorators, flow control, imports, and yielding cases to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. This correction should address the buggy behavior and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
