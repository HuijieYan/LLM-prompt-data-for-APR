### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for setting the `before` variable inside the `while` loop is incorrect. The intention of the loop is to pop elements from the `self.previous_defs` list until the depth is less than the current line's depth. However, the assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` inside the `while` loop does not correctly handle this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable inside the `while` loop is correctly updated based on the depth conditions. We should only set the `before` variable to 1 if `depth` is not 0, otherwise, it should be set to 2.

### Corrected Code:

from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
``` 

### Updated Explanation:
I corrected the bug in the `while` loop by adjusting the assignment of the `before` variable inside the loop. Now, the `before` variable will be set to 1 if the depth is not 0 and 2 if the depth is 0, ensuring the correct handling of the scenario where the depth is not 0. This change should address the issue and provide the expected behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
