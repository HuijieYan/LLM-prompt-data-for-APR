### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for handling empty lines before certain types of lines in the code. In particular, the issue arises when dealing with decorators and specific line structures. The function is incorrectly determining the number of newlines to insert before such lines, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results in the failing test cases.

### Bug Location
The bug seems to stem from the conditions involving decorators, imports, and flow control lines. These conditions are not correctly determining the number of newlines to insert based on the characteristics of the current and previous lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it is necessary to revisit the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before specific types of lines. Make sure that the conditions accurately assess the current line attributes and the relation with the previous line to calculate the correct number of newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
            
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions where the number of newlines is determined and ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is inserted in specific cases, the fixed function should pass the failing test cases.
