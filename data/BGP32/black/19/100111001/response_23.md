### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how it handles the number of newlines to insert based on different conditions. The function checks various properties of the `current_line` and previous lines to determine the number of newlines to add. However, in some cases, it fails to handle the correct logic, leading to incorrect newline insertion.

1. The function seems to be incorrectly setting `before` to 1 or 2 based on the depth condition within the while loop. This logic may not be correctly updating the `before` value as expected.
2. There are conditions where it returns specific newline numbers without considering some edge cases or conflicting conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Correct the logic for setting the `before` variable within the while loop to ensure it reflects the correct value based on the depth condition.
2. Review and update the conditional statements for determining the number of newlines to insert based on different line properties to cover all possible scenarios.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count('\n'), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ''
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the conditions specified in the function. By updating the logic and considering various edge cases, the function should pass the failing test provided.
