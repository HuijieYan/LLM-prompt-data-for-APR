### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function appears to stem from how the `before` variable, which determines the number of empty lines before the current line, is updated and handled in various conditions within the function. The function checks for specific conditions related to the current line type (such as decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields) but incorrect or inconsistent updates to the `before` variable can lead to incorrect empty line insertion behavior.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, it's evident that the logic responsible for handling and updating the `before` variable in different scenarios is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs and failing tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions and scenarios specified in the function. The logic responsible for setting the appropriate number of empty lines before the current line needs to be revised and structured accurately to produce the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:  # Adjust line insertions based on the current line type
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version revises the logic for updating the `before` variable appropriately in different scenarios to ensure correct handling of empty lines before each line. It addresses the inconsistencies that led to failing tests and should now provide the expected output.
