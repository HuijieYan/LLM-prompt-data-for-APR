### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. It checks various conditions based on the type of the current line (`is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, etc.) and the relationship with the previous line.

One noticeable issue is in the while loop where it pops elements from `self.previous_defs` and assigns different values to `before`. The logic here seems incorrect as it assigns 1 if `depth` is 0, and 2 otherwise. This might lead to incorrect values being set for `before`.

Another issue is the handling of the case when `current_line` is a decorator. It sets `newlines = 2`, which means it always inserts 2 empty lines in this case, which may not be desirable.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic in the while loop to set `before` based on the previous depth properly.
2. Review the logic for decorators and adjust the number of empty lines accordingly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        depth = self.previous_defs[-1] if self.previous_defs else 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            newlines = 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the conditions specified in the code.
