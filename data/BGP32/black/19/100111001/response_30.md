### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the incorrect handling of empty lines when dealing with decorators in the input source code. The function aims to control the number of empty lines to be inserted based on certain conditions, such as decorators, flow control, imports, etc.

In the failing test case mentioned, the error message is an `AssertionError` raised by the `assertFormatEqual` method. This error indicates a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the function `fs(source)`. The incorrect behavior is likely due to incorrect calculation or assignment of the empty lines based on the conditions defined in the function.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we observe that the bug mainly occurs when dealing with decorators, which leads to errors in the generated output, resulting in a failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we should focus on the logic related to decorators and how empty lines are handled in these cases. By reconsidering the conditions and calculations for empty lines insertion, we can adjust the function to correctly handle the cases involving decorators and ensure that the output aligns with the expected results.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Check for decorators
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Add condition to handle decorators correctly
    if current_line.is_decorator and not is_decorator:
        return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By including the additional condition to handle decorators correctly and adjust the insertion of empty lines as needed, this corrected version should alleviate the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
