### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not handling the case where `current_line` is a decorator or contains a decorator properly. In particular, the function incorrectly determines the number of newlines to return when encountering decorators. This leads to incorrect output when there are decorators present in the source code, as evident from the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function related to decorators. Specifically, we should ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the presence of decorators in the input source code.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        # Don't add empty lines before or after decorators
        return 0, 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (max_allowed or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (max_allowed or 1), 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug related to handling decorators and ensure that the function works correctly with decorators in the source code.
