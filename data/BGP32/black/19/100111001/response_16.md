### Bug Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for managing the insertion of empty lines in the code based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of empty lines before decorators and certain control flow structures. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates that the expected output and the actual output are not matching due to incorrect empty line management.

1. In Case 1, the function should correctly handle a situation where `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`. It should not insert empty lines in this case.

2. In Case 2, the function is not handling the case where `current_line.is_decorator` is `False` correctly. It should return empty lines based on the depth and not insert additional empty lines.

3. In Case 3, similar to Case 1, the function fails to handle the situation where there is a decorator. It incorrectly inserts 2 empty lines.

4. In Case 4, the function fails to handle the insertion of empty lines properly before the current line, resulting in mismatched output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that it correctly handles the cases where decorators are present and where empty lines should or should not be inserted. By adjusting the conditions for empty line insertion based on the current line type and context, we can ensure the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these adjustments to the conditions and logic within the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly manage the insertion of empty lines in the code.
