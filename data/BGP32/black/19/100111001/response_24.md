### Bug Analysis
The bug arises from incorrect handling of the number of newlines to be inserted before a line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of newlines to be inserted based on various conditions related to the current and previous lines. However, the logic seems to be flawed, causing the function to produce incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the conditions for decorators are not properly handled. When the `current_line` involves a decorator, the function incorrectly returns the number of empty lines based on the depth of the current line rather than following the correct logic.
   
2. In Case 2, the issue lies with the `max_allowed` variable. It is set to 2 initially when it should be 1 for the intended condition regarding comments in decorators.
   
3. In Case 3, the function does not accurately detect when newlines should be inserted. It incorrectly uses the depth information to determine the number of newlines to add.

4. In Case 4, the conditional check for comments related to decorators is flawed. It fails to consider the situation when the `current_line` is not a comment to be inserted, leading to incorrect newline counts.

5. In Case 5, similar to the previous cases, the function fails to correctly identify the need for inserting newlines before certain lines based on different factors.

6. Case 6 highlights another bug related to decorators. The conditions for handling decorators are not adequately checked, leading to incorrect behavior.

7. In Case 7, the function does not properly handle tracking of previous definitions. As a result, the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert gets affected.

8. Finally, in Case 8, the function's handling of the depth and number of newlines to insert is incorrect, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to:
- Adjust the conditions and logic for detecting whether newlines should be inserted before the current line.
- Ensure that decorators, comments, and other relevant factors are properly considered to determine the number of newlines.
- Correctly update the `max_allowed` variable in accordance with the specific conditions.
- Address the incorrect handling of depths and previous definitions in determining newline counts.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary
By correcting the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to accurately determine the number of newlines to insert before each line based on the conditions provided, we can address the bug and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the failing tests.
