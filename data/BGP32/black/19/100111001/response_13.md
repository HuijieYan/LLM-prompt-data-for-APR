### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to have an issue with determining the number of empty lines to insert based on certain conditions. The function analyses the current line and the previous line to decide if empty lines need to be inserted. However, there are issues with how the `before` variable is handled in the logic.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, when `current_line.depth` is 0, and `current_line` is a decorator, the function should have returned `2, 0` as there are no decorators above it. However, the function incorrectly returns `0, 0` instead, resulting in a failed test.
2. In Case 2, when the current line has a comment `'# TODO: X'` and is not a decorator, the function fails to properly handle the case, leading to a failed test.
3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly returns `2, 0` instead of handling the situation correctly, causing the test to fail.
4. In Case 4, the function should have returned `0, 0` as the current line is not an import statement, but it erroneously returns `0, 0`, failing the test.
5. In Case 5, the function should have returned `2, 0` because the current line is a decorator, but returns `0, 0`, causing a failed test.
6. In Case 6, although the current line is a decorator, the function wrongly returns `2, 0` instead of `1, 0`, leading to a failed test.
7. In Case 7, the function fails to handle the situation where the current line is a function definition properly, resulting in a failed test.
8. In Case 8, the function fails to properly determine the number of empty lines to insert when the current line is not a decorator, leading to a failed test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the issues mentioned above, we need to ensure that the logic inside `_maybe_empty_lines` properly handles the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the characteristics of the current line.

### Corrected Implementation of `_maybe_empty_lines`
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By updating the logic to handle the described cases, the corrected implementation should now pass the failing tests.
