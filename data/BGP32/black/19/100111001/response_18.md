### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to analyze the current line to determine the number of empty lines to insert before it in the formatted output. The bug seems to be related to the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines to insert before decorators in the code.

In the failing test case provided, the error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted output when dealing with the case of inserting empty lines before decorators. This discrepancy could be due to incorrect handling of empty lines in the given test scenario.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the if condition checking decorators and the empty line insertion logic. The issue may arise from how the function handles decorators in conjunction with the logic to determine the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic responsible for handling empty lines before decorators. This involves ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the current line being processed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to the logic surrounding decorators and how empty lines are handled before them. This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test case.
