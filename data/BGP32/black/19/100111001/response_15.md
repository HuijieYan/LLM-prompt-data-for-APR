### Bug Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for handling empty lines in Python code formatting. The function checks various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` object and the previous state to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

The bug seems to be related to the insertion of extra newlines in specific cases, causing the failure of the test cases. The issue might be with the logic related to handling decorators and def/class statements.

### Bug Explanation:
- The function checks if the `current_line` is a decorator, def, or class.
- If it's a decorator, it should not insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators. However, the check `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` does not seem robust and may not cover all necessary scenarios.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle decorators and their boundaries to prevent the insertion of unnecessary empty lines. Here's an updated version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This updated version includes a more thorough check for decorators and accounts for all possible scenarios to avoid the insertion of excessive empty lines.

Try running the failing test case with this updated `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the bug is fixed and the test case passes successfully.
