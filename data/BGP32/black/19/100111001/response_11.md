### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the way it handles the `before` variable when processing different types of lines. In some cases, the value of `before` is set based on specific conditions, but those conditions are later overwritten without proper consideration, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly determined and updated based on the line type and surrounding context. Specifically, we should avoid reassigning `before` in a way that might cause it to lose its intended value.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth > 0)
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the corrections as outlined above, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the conditions and return the expected results, passing the failing test cases.
