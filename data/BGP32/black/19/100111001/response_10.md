### Explanation:
The bug stems from the logic related to handling empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is designed to manage the presence of empty lines based on various conditions like depth of the current line, type of line (decorator, def, class, etc.), and the relationship with the previous line.

In Case 1, the function handles the case where `current_line` is a decorator. It sets `newlines` to 2 and returns it in the tuple. However, the output should depend on the presence of `self.previous_line` and the type of the previous line. Since the logic does not consider these aspects correctly, the function returns an incorrect value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The issue mainly lies in the conditional statements that determine the number of newlines to insert. Each condition should be evaluated properly to cover all scenarios and consider the relationship with the previous line. By adjusting the logic in the function, we can address these issues and ensure the correct behavior based on the given inputs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return max(0, newlines), 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return max(0, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0
```

By updating the conditions and calculations within the function, we should be able to address the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the specific scenario evaluated by the function.
