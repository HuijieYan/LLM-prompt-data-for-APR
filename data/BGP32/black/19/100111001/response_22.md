### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrect assignment of the `before` variable inside the while loop that checks the `self.previous_defs`. The `before` variable is being assigned either `1` or `2` based on the condition inside the loop, but it should instead be accumulated for each iteration. As a result, the value of `before` is not properly calculated and causes unexpected behavior in subsequent checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the `before` variable is assigned within the `while` loop. Instead of overriding `before` in each iteration, we should accumulate the values of `before` for each case. This will ensure that the correct number of before lines is calculated and returned by the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    accumulated_before = 0  # Initialize accumulated before to 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        accumulated_before += 1 if depth else 2  # Accumulate the value

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return accumulated_before, 0  # Return the accumulated value of before
``` 

After applying this fix, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should correctly calculate the number of lines to be inserted before the current line based on the accumulated `before` value. This should resolve the issues causing the failing tests.
