### Issue:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a logic error in handling the insertion of empty lines in certain cases, leading to failing tests and incorrect behavior.

The function calculates the number of empty lines to insert before the `current_line`. In some scenarios, such as when encountering decorators or flow control statements, the function returns incorrect values, causing assertion errors.

### Bug Analysis:
1. In Case 1, the function is expected to insert 2 newlines before the `current_line` since it's a decorator; however, it returns only 1 newline.
2. In Case 2, the function should not insert empty lines before the first line in the file; however, it incorrectly inserts 1 newline.
3. In Case 3, the function is expected to insert 2 newlines before the `current_line` due to a decorator; however, it only inserts 1 newline.
4. In Case 4, the function fails to account for empty lines between decorators, leading to incorrect newlines being inserted.
5. In Case 5, the function fails to insert the correct number of empty lines before the `current_line`.
6. In Case 6 and Case 8, the function returns the wrong amount of empty lines based on the conditions.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the identified issues, we need to adjust the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the scenarios when deciding the number of empty lines to insert before the `current_line`. Specifically, we should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions defined in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth < 1 and self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the corrected logic into the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, it should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before the `current_line` and address the failing tests.
