### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the condition for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code. In the problematic scenarios where the function fails, the logic for handling empty lines before specific types of lines (decorators, imports, yield statements) is incorrect. This results in wrong empty line calculations and ultimately leads to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before different types of lines, considering the specific scenarios mentioned in the failing tests.
2. Ensure that the conditions for handling decorators, imports, and yield statements are properly evaluated to insert the correct number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the corrected version of the function, the logic for handling different line types and calculating empty lines before each type is refined to resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
