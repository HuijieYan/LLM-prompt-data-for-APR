### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that when checking whether to insert empty lines before certain types of lines, the logic is incorrectly handling decorators, resulting in incorrect calculations for the number of newlines to insert. This leads to misplacing empty lines and causing the tests to fail with assertion errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted before decorators and other specific types of lines. By correcting the calculation based on the conditions specified in the function, we can ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle decorators and other conditions for inserting empty lines, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
