### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when handling nested decorators. When encountering nested decorators, the function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to insert between them. This results in incorrect formatting, leading to failing test cases like `test_comment_in_decorator`.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in the logic that determines the number of newlines to insert between decorators. Incorrect logic leads to unexpected newline insertion, causing the failure in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic that determines the number of newlines between decorators. Specifically, we need to correct the calculation to ensure the proper newline placement between nested decorators.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines += 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 1, 0
```

By correcting the logic for handling decorators, the corrected function should now properly format the code and pass the failing test cases.
