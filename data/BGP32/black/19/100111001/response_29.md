### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly handling the case when `current_line` is a decorator. The function is designed to control the number of empty lines before certain types of code constructs. When dealing with decorators, the function incorrectly determines the number of newlines to insert, leading to an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic for handling decorators needs to be improved. Specifically, the function should correctly determine the number of newlines needed before a decorator based on the context and should not insert unnecessary lines. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 1 if depth else 2
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Correction Rationale
The corrected version of the function includes a more precise logic for handling decorators. It ensures that the appropriate number of newlines are inserted before decorators, based on the context and surrounding code constructs, as intended. This modification should address the bug and make the function behave correctly in all scenarios.
