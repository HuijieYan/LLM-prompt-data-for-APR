### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for handling the insertion of empty lines in between the code lines based on certain conditions. 
The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to the incorrect handling of empty lines before and after comments within decorators.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The if condition for `is_decorator` does not seem to correctly handle the scenario involving comments within decorators.
2. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before and after different types of code lines may need to be adjusted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from the code not correctly handling the case where comments are present within decorators, resulting in an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, you need to ensure that comments within decorators are correctly handled during the insertion of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and not '\n'.join(self.previous_line.comment_leaves).strip():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators if there are no comments
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        and not self.previous_line.comment_leaves[-1].strip()
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        and not '\n'.join(self.previous_line.comment_leaves).strip()
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes modifications to properly handle the scenario where comments are present within decorators and make sure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the conditions.
