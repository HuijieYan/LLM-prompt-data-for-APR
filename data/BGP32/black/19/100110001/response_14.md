### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method that determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an `AssertionError` because the expected output and the actual output do not match, specifically related to the insertion of empty lines.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where the handling of empty lines before and after certain types of lines may not be correct.

### Bug Cause:
- The function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines before and after certain types of lines like decorators, import statements, and yield statements. This incorrect handling results in a mismatch of expected and actual output in the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the current line and previous line types.
- By adjusting the conditions for inserting empty lines and considering all scenarios involving different types of lines, we can fix the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Default values
    empty_lines_before = 0
    empty_lines_after = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        empty_lines_before = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        empty_lines_before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), 1)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        empty_lines_before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        empty_lines_after = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return empty_lines_before, empty_lines_after

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return empty_lines_before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        empty_lines_before = 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        empty_lines_before = 1

    return empty_lines_before, 0
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function adjusts the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line based on the type of the current line and the previous line.
- By considering all possible scenarios and correctly handling the insertion of empty lines, the function should now properly pass the failing test.
