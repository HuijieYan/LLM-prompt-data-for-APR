### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `black.py` file is failing because it is not handling the case correctly when there is a comment within a decorator block. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is checking for formatting equality between expected and actual results, but the function is not inserting empty lines where needed in the presence of comments within decorators.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for the scenario where there are comments within decorator blocks, causing the formatting to be incorrect and the test to fail. This is evident from the error message indicating a mismatch due to missing empty lines and incorrect comment placement.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to handle the case of comments within decorators correctly. This involves checking for decorators with comments and ensuring the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted to maintain the expected formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.prefix.startswith("#"):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adding a check for decorators followed by comments in the corrected function, it will ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted when needed. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test as well.
