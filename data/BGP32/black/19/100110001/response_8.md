## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line during formatting. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a discrepancy in the number of empty lines inserted in the actual output compared to the expected output.

## Issue:
The bug occurs when handling decorators without properly considering the situation when inserting empty lines. This causes the discrepancy in the number of empty lines between the expected and actual outputs.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for handling decorators to ensure that empty lines are inserted correctly.
2. Update the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on the context of the current line relative to the previous line.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or (depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic for handling decorators and adjusting the conditions for determining empty lines based on the context of the current line, the corrected function should now accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line during formatting.
