### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is expecting the correct formatting when there are comments in decorators, but it fails due to incorrect handling of empty lines by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
- The error message shows that there is a mismatch in the number of empty lines inserted between the expected and actual output.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the logic of determining the number of empty lines before certain types of lines. The condition for handling decorators, `is_decorator`, is not correctly checking whether it is a decorator. Additionally, the logic for handling newlines before decorators and flow control statements needs adjustment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the conditions for checking decorators to ensure correct handling.
2. Fix the logic for determining the number of empty lines before decorators and flow control statements.
3. Properly handle newlines before imports and yields.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class or (is_decorator and not current_line.is_flow_control):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        return 2 - current_line.depth, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

Applying the above corrections to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should resolve the issues and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
