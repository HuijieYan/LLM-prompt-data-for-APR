### Analysis:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line in the code. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual output. The error message indicates that the actual output generated by the function does not match the expected output. It seems like the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions within the code.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in how the function is handling the insertion of empty lines before decorators in the code. It is not properly managing the insertion of empty lines before and after decorators, leading to incorrect output.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a decorator in the code and fails to handle the insertion of empty lines accordingly. This results in the generation of incorrect output, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the insertion of empty lines before and after decorators. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for determining the number of empty lines based on whether the current line is a decorator or not.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    # Adjust logic for handling decorators
    if is_decorator:
        return 0, 1

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the function has been updated to handle decorators and correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after decorators in the code. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
