The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions.

The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` in the `test_black.py` file is showing a specific assertion error when comparing the expected formatted source code with the actual formatted source code. The error message indicates a mismatch in the number of empty lines between the expected and actual outputs.

Looking at the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, one potential issue is the calculation and handling of the `before` variable. It seems that the function is not correctly updating the `before` value based on the conditions, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

One possible strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly calculated and updated based on the conditions that affect the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After applying this correction to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, run the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` again to verify if the bug has been fixed and the test now passes successfully.
