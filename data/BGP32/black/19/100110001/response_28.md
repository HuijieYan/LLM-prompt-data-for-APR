### Analysis:
- The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling decisions related to inserting empty lines in the code.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an `AssertionError` when comparing the expected and actual output.
- The error message shows a difference in the number of empty lines inserted between comments in decorators.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` might be incorrectly determining the number of empty lines to insert in specific scenarios, like decorators.
2. The handling of previous and current lines in the function might not be accurate.

### Bug Cause:
The issue may be with how the function determines the number of empty lines to insert before certain elements in the code, like decorators. This incorrect calculation results in a difference between the expected and actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Review and adjust the logic within the function `_maybe_empty_lines` to ensure the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the code structure and requirements.
- Specifically, focus on the sections related to inserting empty lines before decorators, flow control elements, imports, etc.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        num_pops = len(self.previous_defs) - self.previous_defs.index(current_line.depth)
        for _ in range(num_pops):
            self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

Make sure to test this corrected version using the failing test to verify that the bug has been fixed.
