### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle formatting of empty lines in the code. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a formatting issue caused by the function not handling decorators properly. 

### Issues:
1. The function is not correctly handling empty lines between decorators.
2. The function is not considering the case where comments are present in decorators, leading to formatting issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` causes incorrect handling of empty lines between decorators, resulting in a formatting mismatch when comments are present in the decorator section. This leads to the failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles empty lines between decorators.
2. Modify the function logic to include comments within decorators in the formatting decision.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Fix for comments within decorators
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.prefix.strip().startswith("#"):
        return 0, 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the fix for comments within decorators, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
