The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function causes incorrect handling of empty lines in certain cases, leading to formatting issues. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing because of incorrect handling of empty lines between decorators and comments in the function code.

The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling empty lines before decorators is not functioning correctly. In particular, the condition for inserting empty lines before decorators is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling empty lines before decorators needs to be adjusted to correctly insert empty lines based on the conditions of the current line and the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
               return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By modifying the condition to check for previous line decorators correctly, the corrected version of the function should now handle empty lines before decorators as intended and pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
