### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to add or remove based on certain conditions related to the current line being processed. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is triggering an assertion error because the actual output does not match the expected output, specifically in the handling of empty lines within decorators.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic for handling empty lines within decorators. The function is not correctly adjusting the number of empty lines to be added or removed in this scenario, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for handling empty lines within decorators and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned.
2. Check if the conditions for skipping empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators are being correctly implemented.
3. Verify if the conditions related to flow control, imports, and yields are being handled properly.
4. Ensure that the depth, is_decorator, and other attributes of the current line are accurately considered in the decision-making process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth != 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function addresses the issues identified and should now handle the conditions for adding or removing empty lines correctly.
