### Analysis:
The error message indicates a problem with the formatting of the source code. The `assertFormatEqual` function is failing to assert that the expected and actual formatted code are equal.

### Bug:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. The bug might be related to the logic of handling empty lines before decorators.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before decorators. When encountering a line that is a decorator (`is_decorator` is True), the function should not insert empty lines. However, the current logic does not handle this case correctly, causing extra newlines to be inserted before decorators.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the case of empty lines before decorators.
2. Ensure that no empty lines are inserted before decorators by updating the conditions and return values accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class:
                # Don't insert empty lines before decorators, definitions, or class declarations
                return 0, 0
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the adjustments described above, the corrected function should now handle the case of empty lines before decorators correctly, thus addressing the bug.
