### Analysis:
- The `test_comment_in_decorator` test is failing with an `AssertionError` when comparing the expected output to the actual output.
- The error message indicates a difference in the number of empty lines in the output.
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug seems to be related to the logic of handling empty lines in different scenarios within `_maybe_empty_lines`.
- The issue might be with how the function calculates and updates the number of empty lines.
- We need to review the logic for inserting empty lines based on the conditions of the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 1  # Update this line to return 1 if empty line is required, instead of returning 0 in all cases
```

By updating the last return statement in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to `return before, 1`, we ensure that if an empty line is required, it will be inserted before the current line. This change should address the issue with the incorrect number of empty lines being inserted, causing the failing test case to pass.
