### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the logic of inserting empty lines in the code formatting process. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an error indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual output. This indicates that the buggy function is not properly handling the insertion of empty lines within decorators.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the inconsistency in handling empty lines within decorators. When encountering a decorator, the function should not insert empty lines unless specific conditions are met. The current implementation does not properly handle this case, leading to incorrect formatting and causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines within decorators based on the specified conditions. Specifically, the function should not insert empty lines between decorators and should check for the depth of the current line to determine the number of newlines to insert.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        ):
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the specified adjustments in the logic for handling decorators, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
