### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that need to be inserted before a particular line in the code formatting process. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing because it expects a specific formatting result which is not being achieved due to the buggy behavior of `_maybe_empty_lines`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when `current_line.is_decorator` is true. Specifically, it does not handle the case properly where there is a comment inside a decorator which leads to incorrect empty line insertion.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `current_line.is_decorator` is true, we handle the case where there are comments within the decorator correctly. We should count the number of newlines before the comment within the decorator and adjust `before` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_decorator and len(current_line.prefix) > 0:
        # Adjust before count for comments inside decorators
        before += current_line.prefix.count("\n")

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we have added a check for `current_line.is_decorator` along with comments inside decorators. This check ensures that we count the number of newlines within a decorator correctly, allowing for proper empty line insertion.
