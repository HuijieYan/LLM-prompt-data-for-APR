### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is asserting the output of `fs(source)` with the expected result using `self.assertFormatEqual`.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically related to the presence of comments in decorators.
4. The bug seems to be in handling the insertion of empty lines before decorators.
  
### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises when dealing with comments inside decorators. If there are comments within decorators in the source code, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` struggles to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before decorators, leading to incorrect formatting and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for inserting empty lines correctly handles comments within decorators. This involves updating the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert based on the presence of comments in decorators.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and (self.previous_line.is_comment or self.previous_line.prefix and "#" in self.previous_line.prefix)
        and not current_line.is_comment
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Correction Made:
I added a new condition to check if the previous line is a comment (or has a "#" in the prefix) and the current line is not a comment. This allows for the correct handling of empty lines before decorators that contain comments.

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly handle comments within decorators and insert the correct number of empty lines, fixing the bug.
