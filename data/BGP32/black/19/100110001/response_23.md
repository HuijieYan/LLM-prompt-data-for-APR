### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the function call `fs(source)` which is used to format the source code.
3. The error message indicates that there is an extra newline (empty line) inserted before the `@property` line, causing the assertion to fail.
4. The bug seems to be related to the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` that handles the insertion of empty lines before certain types of lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to occur when handling certain types of lines like decorators. The logic to determine the number of empty lines to insert for decorators is incorrect, causing extra empty lines to be inserted before `@property` lines.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly handle empty line insertion for decorators. Specifically, we need to ensure that no extra empty lines are inserted before decorator lines like `@property`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 0  # Adjusted newlines calculation
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the calculation for the number of empty lines to insert before decorator lines in the corrected version, we should prevent the extra newline issue and ensure that the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` passes successfully.
