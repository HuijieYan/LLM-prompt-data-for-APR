### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing the expected output with the actual output after formatting the source code.
3. The error message indicates that the number of empty lines inserted before the current line is incorrect, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue might be with how the function `_maybe_empty_lines` handles the insertion of empty lines before certain types of lines, particularly in cases involving decorators, imports, or yields.

### Bug Cause:
The bug appears to be related to how empty lines are handled in the presence of decorators and comments. The incorrect handling of empty lines before or after decorators is causing the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the logic for handling empty lines before decorators to ensure the correct number of blank lines is inserted.
2. Ensure that empty lines are handled properly in cases involving imports and yields to match the expected output provided by the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_def:
        return before, 2
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the handling of empty lines in the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test case.
