### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `black.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is located in the `test_black.py` file.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the test, comparing the expected output with the actual output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in specific cases, leading to differences in the output.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of empty lines when dealing with decorators and import statements.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. Inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the logic for handling empty lines in the case of decorators is incorrect.
2. The function is not considering all possible scenarios when determining the number of empty lines to insert between lines.
3. This incorrect handling results in a difference between the expected and actual output, leading to the test failure.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Adjust the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle cases involving decorators, import statements, and other specific scenarios.
2. Ensure that the function properly calculates the number of empty lines to insert based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 1, 0  # Changed to returning 1 empty line
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 1, 0  # Changed to returning 1 empty line
        newlines = 1  # Changed to insert 1 empty line
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return 0, 0  # Changed to not insert empty lines
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return 0, 0  # Changed to not insert empty lines
    return before, 0
```

After applying the corrections to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, re-run the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to verify that the corrected version now passes the test.
