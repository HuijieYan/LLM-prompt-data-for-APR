The bug in the provided function is related to the incorrect usage of the `self.previous_line` attribute. The function is not correctly checking if the `previous_line` has the `is_import` attribute before attempting to access it. This causes an AttributeError when the `is_import` attribute is checked without verifying if the `previous_line` object exists. 

To fix this bug and address the failing test cases, we need to update the function to appropriately handle cases where `self.previous_line` might be `None` or when it doesn't have the `is_import` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import') and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield') and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function includes checks for `self.previous_line` existence and whether it has the necessary attributes before accessing them. By updating the function in this way, it should now correctly handle the cases causing the bug and pass the failing test cases.
