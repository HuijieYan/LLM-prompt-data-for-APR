### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition where the function checks whether `current_line is_import` by calling `current_line.is_import`. However, the function should be calling the `is_import` function that is defined outside of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function but in the same file. Due to this error, the function incorrectly tries to access the attribute `is_import`, which leads to incorrect behavior during execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` correctly calls the `is_import` function defined outside of it. By utilizing the `is_import` function as intended, we can properly check if `current_line` corresponds to an import statement. This will enable the function to behave correctly and return the expected outcomes for the provided test cases.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By replacing `current_line.is_import` with `is_import(current_line)` within the function, we ensure the correct check for import statements. This correction should resolve the bug and enable the corrected function to pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
