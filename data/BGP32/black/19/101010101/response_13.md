### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the comparison of line types `is_import`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield`. The function is incorrectly comparing these line types with boolean values resulting in unexpected behavior and failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions for line types `is_import`, `is_flow_control`, and `is_yield` are correctly evaluated based on the actual properties of the line objects. We should adjust the comparisons to accurately reflect the line types.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not is_import(current_line):
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the comparisons based on the actual functions that check line types and adjusting the logic where necessary, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
