### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from a logical error in handling empty lines before certain types of code blocks. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on specific conditions related to code structure. The bug causes incorrect insertion or lack of empty lines, leading to incorrect formatting.

The main issues in the function are:
1. The logic for handling empty lines based on different code structures is not accurately implemented.
2. Incorrect usage of `self.previous_defs` list in determining the number of empty lines to be inserted.

The `self.previous_defs` list is intended to keep track of depths of previous code blocks (e.g., functions, classes) to regulate empty line insertion. However, improper manipulation of this list leads to incorrect decisions in empty line handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Adjust the logic for handling empty lines based on different code structures such as decorators, flow control, imports, etc.
2. Properly maintain and update the `self.previous_defs` list to accurately determine when to add empty lines.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code:
1. The logic for handling different code structures is updated to ensure the correct number of empty lines is inserted.
2. The function `is_import` is used to check if a line is an import statement.
3. The manipulations of the `self.previous_defs` list are corrected to maintain proper tracking of code block depths, ensuring accurate empty line handling.
