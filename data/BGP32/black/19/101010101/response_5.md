The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect check `self.previous_line.is_import` which results in a false comparison in cases where `self.previous_line` doesn't have an `is_import` attribute. This causes faulty logic and incorrect return values.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the absence of `is_import` attribute in `self.previous_line`. We can add an additional check to verify if `self.previous_line` exists before checking for the `is_import` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line 
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
        and self.previous_line.is_import 
        and not current_line.is_import 
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adding the `hasattr` check in the conditions related to `self.previous_line`, we ensure that we only access the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes if they exist. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected in all test cases.
