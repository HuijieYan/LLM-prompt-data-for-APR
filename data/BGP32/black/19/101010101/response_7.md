### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle indentation and spacing adjustments in Python code.
2. The function uses various attributes of the `current_line` object and the state stored in the `self` object to determine the necessary adjustments.
3. The function checks various conditions related to decorators, def statements, flow control, imports, and yields to decide on adding empty lines.
4. The function interacts with other functions like `is_import` to determine certain conditions.
5. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual formatting of the code, suggesting that the function is not correctly handling the indentation and spacing.
6. The expected inputs include different combinations of `current_line` attributes and the `self` object's state.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function assigns values to `before`. The logic that updates `before` based on conditions is not consistent, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that `before` is correctly updated based on different conditions.
2. Debug each condition where `before` is updated to identify the problematic sections.
3. Check if the conditions for adjusting `depth` are handled correctly.
4. Verify that all relevant attributes of `current_line` and `self` are considered appropriately.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This updated version of the function should address the issue with the incorrect handling of `before` value and address the spacing and indentation adjustments more accurately.
