### Correction Strategy
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the conditions to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue arises from not properly updating the values of the variables based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function.

To correct this, we need to address the conditions separately and ensure that the variables `before` and `newlines` are correctly updated based on the checks performed in the function. We also need to address the cases where the `self.previous_line` is not `None` and correctly handle the scenarios mentioned in the if conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Explanation
1. We correctly handle the conditions to determine the number of empty lines before the current line.
2. Update the variable values `before` and `newlines` based on the specific conditions checked in the function.
3. Ensure that the case for `self.previous_line` is not `None` is properly handled.
4. Modify the condition checking for `is_import` to call the function `is_import(self.previous_line)` to avoid the error.
5. The corrected version should now correctly handle the scenarios provided in the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
