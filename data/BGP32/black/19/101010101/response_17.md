The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. The function makes use of the attribute `is_import` from the `Leaf` class, but it should be called as a method with an instance of `Leaf` as an argument. This misuse could lead to errors.
2. The condition `if current_line.depth == 0:` is directly accessing the `depth` attribute of `current_line`, which could raise an error if `depth` is not present in the instance passed.
3. The function uses `self.previous_line` without checking if it's `None`, which may lead to an AttributeError if it's not set.

To rectify these issues and correct the function, we need to make the following changes:

1. We should properly call the `is_import` method of the `Leaf` instance in the conditions that need it.
2. Safeguard the `current_line.depth` access by checking if the attribute is present using `.get('depth', 0)` in the parameter.
3. Always check if `self.previous_line` is not `None` before accessing its attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.get('depth', 0) == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.get('depth', 0)

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator()
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.get('depth', 0)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.get('depth', 0))
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By addressing these issues, the corrected function should now handle the input parameters properly and avoid the previously observed errors.
