### Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted or removed based on certain conditions related to the input `current_line` and the previous line. The buggy function has several conditional branches to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted or removed.

The error message indicates a failed test case related to inserting empty lines within decorators. The expected output contains additional empty lines that are not correctly produced by the buggy function.

### Bug in the code:
The bug lies in the conditional check for decorators within the function. When the current line is a decorator, the function incorrectly handles adding empty lines, leading to incorrect output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted when dealing with decorators. Specifically, the function should not insert extra empty lines before the first line in the file and should not insert empty lines between decorators.

### Corrected code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By addressing the condition related to decorators and ensuring that no extra empty lines are added where they are not needed, this corrected version of the function should fix the bug and provide the expected output.
