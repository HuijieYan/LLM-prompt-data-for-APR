### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted or consumed based on specific conditions related to the current line and the previous line in the code. The function has several conditional statements based on properties of the `current_line` object and the `self` object (which is an instance of `EmptyLineTracker`).

The bug arises from the line `and self.previous_line.is_import` where the function attempts to check if the previous line is an import statement by calling the method `is_import()`. However, the function should have called the `is_import()` function from the same file to properly identify import statements.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the correct `is_import()` function from the file.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Import the `is_import()` function into the `black.py` file.
2. Update the buggy line `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly call `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: black.py

# Import the is_import function from the same file
from black import is_import

# Updated _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Corrected line
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the bug as described above, the corrected function will be able to correctly identify import statements and determine the number of empty lines to insert or consume as intended.
