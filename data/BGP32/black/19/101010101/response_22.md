The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the usage of the `is_import` function. In the buggy function, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is used to check if the previous line is an import. However, `is_import` is defined outside the function without being passed as an argument, which leads to a NameError when trying to access `is_import`.

To fix this bug, we need to pass the `is_import` function as an argument to `_maybe_empty_lines` so that it can be accessed within the function. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, is_import: Callable[[Line], bool]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By passing the `is_import` function as an argument, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function can now correctly use it to determine if the previous line is an import, fixing the NameError issue.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values for the different cases provided.
