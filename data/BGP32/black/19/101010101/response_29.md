The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of conditions related to empty lines in various contexts. The function is responsible for deciding whether to insert empty lines based on the current line being processed. The identified issues are:
- Incorrect handling of the case where the line is a decorator or definition.
- Incorrect handling of the case where the current line is an import and the previous one is not.
- Incorrect handling of the case where the current line is a yield statement.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions and the logic for deciding when to insert empty lines. Specifically, we need to check the conditions correctly for decorators, definitions, imports, and yield statements to ensure the correct insertion of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should handle the conditions correctly and pass the failing test cases while satisfying the expected input/output values.
