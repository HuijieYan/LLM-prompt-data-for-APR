### Analysis
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line in a file, based on certain conditions. It looks at the current line's properties such as depth, leaves, and types and compares them with the previous line to make decisions.

The buggy function has multiple if-else conditions that check various properties of the current line and previous lines to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output related to comments inside decorators in the code.

### Bug in the Code
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison related to decorators' comments. The function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines based on the presence of comments inside decorators.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should correct the comparison related to decorators' comments and adjust the logic accordingly. Specifically, we need to handle the comment insertion inside decorators to align with the expected behavior.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now handle comments inside decorators properly and align with the expected behavior, as outlined in the test cases.
