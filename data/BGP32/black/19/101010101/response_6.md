### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions like depth, previous definitions, decorators, imports, flow control, etc.
2. The function relies on the `self` object, which is an instance of `EmptyLineTracker` that keeps track of previous lines and definitions.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the `is_import` attribute which is a boolean indication if the current line is an import statement. The function calls `is_import` method on an object `current_line` to determine if it's an import.
4. The bug is causing incorrect insertion of newlines in specific cases, leading to failing test assertions due to formatting discrepancies.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. The bug seems to be related to how the import condition is checked in the function.
2. Add a condition to check `current_line.is_import` directly without calling the `is_import` method.
3. Ensure that the handling of imports compared to previous lines is correct to maintain formatting consistency.
4. Update the logic of determining the number of empty lines to respect the import statements properly.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

The corrected function now directly uses the `current_line.is_import` attribute to check if the current line is an import statement. This should fix the bug related to incorrect handling of imports and ensure the correct insertion of newlines in the specified cases, passing the failing test.
