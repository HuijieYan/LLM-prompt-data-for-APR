## Analysis
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line of code.
2. The function makes decisions based on various conditions such as the depth of the current line, whether it is a decorator, a definition, a class, etc.
3. There are issues related to handling the previous line's attributes like `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.
4. The failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output, specifically related to differences in empty lines between decorators and comments inside decorators.
5. The function needs to be corrected to correctly handle these conditions and return the expected number of empty lines.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Implement logic to correctly handle empty lines between decorators and comments inside decorators.
2. Ensure that the handling of previous line attributes is done properly for `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`.
3. Update the return logic to match the expected behavior for different conditions.
4. Test the function with the provided test cases to validate the fix.

## Bug-free Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line) # Fix to check if the current line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield # Fix to check if the previous line is a yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the mentioned fixes and handling the conditions properly, the updated function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected number of empty lines for different scenarios.
