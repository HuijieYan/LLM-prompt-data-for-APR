The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely causing incorrect handling of empty lines in specific situations, resulting in incorrect formatting of the output.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` is incorrect. It wrongly prevents empty lines before the current line if the previous line is a decorator.
2. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` causes an issue as the `is_import` function is not correctly implemented in the code.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition that checks for decorators by removing the restriction on empty lines before the current line if the previous line is a decorator.
2. Fix the `is_import` function or replace its usage with a direct comparison to `True` to check for imports.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line) != True
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now handle empty lines correctly and pass the failing test cases.
