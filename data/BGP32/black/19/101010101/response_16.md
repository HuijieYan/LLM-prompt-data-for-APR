### Analysis
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling empty lines between code blocks according to specific conditions.
2. The function relies on the attributes of the `current_line` object and the `self` object to determine the number of empty lines to insert.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before certain types of code blocks, based on the current line's attributes and the previous line's attributes.
4. The function should determine the appropriate number of empty lines based on the current line's type and relationship with the previous line.

### Bug
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to incorrect handling of empty lines before specific code blocks like decorators, class definitions, and flow control structures. These incorrect decisions lead to the wrong number of empty lines being inserted.

### Strategy
1. Review the conditions under which empty lines should be inserted based on different types of code blocks.
2. Make sure that the function correctly identifies the current line's properties and considers the attributes of the previous line when determining the number of empty lines to insert.
3. Update the logic to handle different scenarios correctly and consider edge cases to ensure accurate empty line insertion.

### Updated Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not self.previous_line:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_class:
        # Don't insert empty lines before or after decorators and classes.
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    return 1, 0
```

### Summary
The updated function now correctly handles the conditions for inserting empty lines before different types of code blocks like decorators, classes, flow control structures, imports, and yields. The logic has been revised to ensure the correct number of empty lines are added based on the relationships between the current line and the previous line.
