### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` which leads to an attribute error because the `previous_line` attribute can be None. In the failing test case, the code checks if `self.previous_line.is_import` when it is expected to be None, causing the comparison to result in an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where we check `self.previous_line.is_import` to first check if `self.previous_line` is not None. This way, we avoid trying to access an attribute on a NoneType object. By adding this extra check, we can ensure that the function handles cases where `self.previous_line` can be None gracefully without causing an attribute error.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

In this corrected version, we changed the lines where we check `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` to `self.previous_line.is_import()` and `self.previous_line.is_yield()` to call the functions appropriately. This modification ensures that we avoid the attribute error and handle the check based on the correct condition to fix the bug.
