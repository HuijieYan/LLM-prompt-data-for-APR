The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has issues with its logic around handling empty lines in code. The main bug occurs when checking for certain conditions related to decorators, imports, and yield statements.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function conditionally inserts empty lines based on the line being a decorator, definition, class, or import statement. However, the logic for handling these conditions is incorrect, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.
2. The check for `is_import` is being performed using `current_line.is_import`, which is never set to `True`. Instead, the correct function to check for an import statement is `is_import(current_line)`
3. When handling `depth`, the logic to determine whether to insert an empty line is flawed and can lead to unexpected results.
4. The handling of `before` and `newlines` based on different conditions is inconsistent and can lead to incorrect evaluation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use the `is_import` method correctly to check if the current line is an import statement.
2. Adjust the conditions for inserting empty lines based on decorators, imports, and yield statements to ensure correct behavior.
3. Simplify the logic for handling `before` and `newlines` to avoid confusion and potential bugs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    is_import_statement = is_import(current_line)

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import_statement
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

After making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the conditions and insert empty lines as expected based on the different scenarios outlined in the test cases.
