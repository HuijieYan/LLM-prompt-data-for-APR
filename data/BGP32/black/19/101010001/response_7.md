## Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the logic of adding empty lines in specific cases during code formatting. The error message indicates a failing test related to comments within decorators. The test is failing because the function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines in this scenario.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of decorators and comments within decorators.
2. Comparison logic with previous lines.
3. Incorrect conditions for adding empty lines.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not differentiate between decorators and comments within decorators when deciding whether to insert empty lines. This causes incorrect formatting in the specific case of comments within decorators, resulting in the failing test.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition to correctly handle comments within decorators and ensure proper insertion of empty lines.
2. Adjust the logic related to decorators to prevent unwanted empty lines between them.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition related to handling decorators and comments within decorators has been updated to ensure proper insertion of empty lines in the given scenario. Additionally, the function now correctly checks if the previous line is an import using the `is_import` function. This fix should resolve the failing test related to comments within decorators.
