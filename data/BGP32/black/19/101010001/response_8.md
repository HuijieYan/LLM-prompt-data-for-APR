## Analysis
1. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` method in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator`.
2. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert in the output. The bug might be related to incorrect logic in handling empty lines.
3. The bug might be related to the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the type of the current line and the previous line.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the conditions for inserting empty lines to match the expected behavior based on the test case failure.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in handling empty lines before and after specific types of lines. This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual output in scenarios where empty lines should be inserted or removed based on the type of lines in the input.

## Fix Strategy
The strategy to fix the bug is to review the conditions for inserting empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the logic is correctly handling cases where empty lines should be inserted or omitted based on the type of the current and previous lines.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we modified the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument to properly handle import lines. This change ensures that the logic for handling imports is consistent with the expected behavior in the test case.
