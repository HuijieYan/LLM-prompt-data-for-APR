1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line of code. The error message indicates that the formatting of the code is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of empty lines.

2. The potential error locations within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be the conditions where the number of empty lines is calculated based on the current line type and depth.

3. The bug is likely caused by conditions that incorrectly calculate the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The incorrect number of empty lines leads to formatting discrepancies between the expected and actual output of the function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to carefully review the conditions for calculating the number of empty lines and ensure that they align with the expected formatting rules. Specifically, we should focus on the conditions that deal with decorators, imports, yield statements, flow control, and class/function definitions.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import` function is properly called to check if the previous line is an import. The logic for calculating the number of empty lines has been adjusted to ensure correct formatting based on different types of lines. This correction should address the formatting discrepancies observed in the failing test.
