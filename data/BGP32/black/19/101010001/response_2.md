## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert between two lines of code.
2. The error message indicates a disagreement between the expected output and the actual output in terms of empty lines.
3. The function uses several conditions to determine when to insert empty lines, including checking if the current line is an import statement. However, there is a bug related to how the function handles the `is_import` function from the same file.
4. The bug seems to be that the `is_import` function is not being correctly called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, leading to incorrect behavior when determining empty lines after import statements.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` function is called correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and that its result is properly handled.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Call the `is_import` function correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. Handle the return value of the `is_import` function appropriately to determine the number of empty lines after import statements.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the `is_import` function is called correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This change addresses the bug related to handling import statements and should fix the incorrect behavior when determining empty lines after import statements.
