## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the logic of adding empty lines before certain types of lines in source code.
2. The error message indicates a failed test due to incorrect handling of empty lines when encountering certain types of lines (like decorators and imports).
3. The bug is likely related to how the function determines when to add empty lines before or after specific types of lines.
4. The function needs to accurately detect and handle situations where empty lines should be inserted.
5. The bug seems to be related to conditions involving decorators and imports.

## Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` fails to correctly add empty lines before decorators and imports. The bug seems to originate from the condition checks related to decorators and imports within the function.

1. In the condition:
   ```python
   if (
       self.previous_line
       and self.previous_line.is_import
       and not current_line.is_import
       and depth == self.previous_line.depth
   ):
       return (before or 1), 0
   ```
   The function incorrectly uses `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling `is_import(self.previous_line)` to check if the previous line is an import. This causes the condition to be evaluated incorrectly.

2. Additionally, in the condition:
   ```python
   if (
       self.previous_line
       and self.previous_line.is_import
       and not current_line.is_import
       and depth == self.previous_line.depth
   ):
       return (before or 1), 0
   ```
   The condition for handling imports is incorrect and does not properly handle the case where an import is not followed by another import at the same depth.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Update the condition for checking imports to correctly use the `is_import` function to check if a line is an import.
2. Adjust the logic to handle adding empty lines before and after imports and decorators appropriately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditions related to imports and making sure to call `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead of using `self.previous_line.is_import`, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle inserting empty lines before or after decorators, imports, and other types of lines in the source code.
