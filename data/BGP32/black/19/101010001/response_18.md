### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to determine the number of empty lines to add before a given line based on certain conditions.
2. The error message from the failing test is comparing the expected output (with additional empty lines) to the actual output (missing empty lines).
3. The bug seems to be related to the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` not correctly handling situations where empty lines should be inserted.
4. The bug might be in the logic that determines when to insert empty lines based on the properties of the current line and the previous line.
5. We need to ensure that empty lines are correctly inserted based on specific conditions like decorators, imports, yield statements, etc.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug likely occurs due to incorrect handling of empty lines insertion based on various conditions such as decorators, imports, yield statements, etc.
- The condition for inserting empty lines before the current line might not be correctly evaluated in certain cases, leading to the missing empty lines observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the cases where empty lines should be inserted.
- Ensure that specific conditions like decorators, import statements, yield statements, etc., are properly considered when determining the number of empty lines to insert.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Changes Made:
- Updated the condition for checking if the previous line is an import statement using the `is_import` function to correctly handle imports.
- Ensure that the logic for inserting empty lines before the current line based on various conditions is properly handled to avoid the missing empty lines issue.
