1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of a larger codebase for formatting Python code. It is specifically responsible for determining how many empty lines should be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions like indentation depth, type of line (import, decorator, etc.), and context with the previous line.

2. The potential error location is in the conditional block that checks if the previous line is an import (`self.previous_line.is_import`).

3. The cause of the bug is that the `is_import` function is actually not being called correctly within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The buggy code tries to access an `is_import` attribute directly on the `self.previous_line`, but `is_import` is a standalone function and not a method of the `Line` object.

4. To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function with the `self.previous_line` as the argument and check its return value.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the line `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:` has been changed to `if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):` to correctly call the `is_import` function. This should fix the bug related to the incorrect attribute access.
