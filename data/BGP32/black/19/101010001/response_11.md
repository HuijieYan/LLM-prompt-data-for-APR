## Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is checking various conditions related to newlines in the code.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `is_import` attribute for the `previous_line`.
3. The error message suggests a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs, focusing on the placement of newlines.
4. The bug may be caused by a logic error in the conditional statements checking for imports and decorators.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic when checking for the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line`. The buggy function is not calling the `is_import` function to check if `previous_line` is an import statement.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to check if the `previous_line` is an import statement by calling the `is_import` function.
2. Ensure that the correct comparison is made to determine whether to insert newlines based on import conditions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the fix involves calling the `is_import` function to correctly check if the `previous_line` is an import statement, ensuring the comparison is accurate for newline insertion based on import conditions. This modification should address the bug and align the newline insertion logic with the expected behavior, resolving the failing test.
