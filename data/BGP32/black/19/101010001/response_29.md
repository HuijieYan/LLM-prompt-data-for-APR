### Analysis:
1. The `is_import` function is called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, but the `is_import` function is not defined in the provided code snippet. This could lead to a NameError when calling `current_line.is_import`.
2. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected vs. actual output of the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case in the `assertFormatEqual` assertion.
3. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line of code based on certain conditions.
4. The bug may be related to the condition checking the `is_import` property of `current_line` without properly defining it.


### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by referencing `current_line.is_import` without defining the related function `is_import` in the provided code snippet. This leads to a potential `AttributeError` when trying to access `current_line.is_import`.


### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` method is properly defined and imported in the environment. We need to make sure that the function `is_import` is accessible to be called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.


### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with a placeholder implementation for the `is_import` function:
```python
from typing import Tuple, Any

class Line:
    pass

class Leaf:
    pass

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
        # Placeholder implementation
        return False

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not self.is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

Ensure to provide a proper implementation for the `is_import` function based on the requirements of the code.
