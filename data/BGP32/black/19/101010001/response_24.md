### Analysis:
1. The `is_import` function is being called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
2. The error message indicates a difference in the expected and actual output related to comments and empty lines within decorators.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes improper handling of empty lines and comments within decorators. The `is_import` function is not correctly being checked within the conditions for inserting newlines and handling decorators.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `is_import` function is properly checked within the conditions.
2. Adjust the logic for handling empty lines, comments, and decorators to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_import` function is properly checked within the condition related to imports.
- Adjustments are made to handle empty lines, comments, and decorators according to the expected behavior.
