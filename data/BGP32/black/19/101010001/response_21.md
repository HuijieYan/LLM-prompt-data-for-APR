### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine how many empty lines should be inserted before the current line.
2. The function checks various conditions related to empty lines, including depth, import statements, decorators, flow control, etc.
3. The error message indicates a discrepancy in the expected empty lines before and after certain lines in the code.
4. The error seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before and after decorators and import statements.

### Potential Error Location:
- The condition `self.previous_line.is_import` in the function seems incorrect.
- Misinterpretation of conditions related to empty lines before and after decorators and import statements might be causing the bug.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines before and after decorators and import statements, resulting in the unexpected number of empty lines in the processed code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after decorators and import statements are correctly implemented.
- Verify that the logic for handling empty lines based on different types of lines is accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is replaced with a function call `is_import(self.previous_line)` to check if the previous line is an import statement.
- The function `is_import` is assumed to correctly determine if a line is an import statement based on the provided leaf object.
- This change ensures that the correct condition is checked for handling empty lines before and after import statements, potentially resolving the bug.
