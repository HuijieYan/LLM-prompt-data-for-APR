## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the test case `test_comment_in_decorator` failed because the expected output does not match the actual output. The discrepancy seems to be related to the presence of extra newlines in the output generated by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling newlines and prefixes in the `while` loop.
2. The conditions for returning newlines based on the properties of `current_line` and `previous_line`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of newlines and prefixes in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before a line and handling prefixes may not be working as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for handling newlines and prefixes is correctly implemented.
2. Check the conditions for returning the number of newlines based on the properties of `current_line` and `previous_line`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        # Modify here to preserve previous newlines before popping
        if before == 0 and depth == 0:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not self.is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
1. Changed how newlines are handled when popping from `self.previous_defs`.
2. Changed the condition to check if the `previous_line` is an import statement by calling the `is_import` function.
3. Ensured that the correct number of newlines are inserted based on the conditions.
