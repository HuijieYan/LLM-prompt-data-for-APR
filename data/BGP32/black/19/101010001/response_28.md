## Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to calculate the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code based on various conditions. The error message indicates a failing test in a situation involving comments within decorators. 

## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` might not be correctly handling empty lines between decorators.
2. The comparison `depth == self.previous_line.depth` in the condition related to imports may not be considering the depth of the current line accurately.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of empty lines when encountering comments within decorators. The function fails to correctly adjust the number of empty lines based on the presence of comments.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted in cases where comments are present within decorators. Additionally, we need to review the conditions related to imports to make sure that the depth comparison is done accurately.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the condition related to decorators has been modified to handle empty lines correctly between decorators. Additionally, the condition involving imports now correctly checks if the previous line is an import and if the current line is not an import based on the `is_import` function. This modification should address the bugs identified.
