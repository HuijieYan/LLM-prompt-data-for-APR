### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted between code lines based on certain conditions.
2. The error message is related to a failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method of a test case, indicating that the expected and actual formatted code outputs do not match.
3. The bug seems to be causing discrepancies in the number of empty lines inserted in certain scenarios, leading to the formatting differences between the expected and actual outputs.
4. The function logic for handling empty lines based on different line types, depth, decorators, imports, etc., needs to be reviewed and potentially corrected to ensure consistent formatting.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in specific cases like decorators, imports, and flow control lines. Incorrect determinations of the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the line types and their relationships are causing formatting discrepancies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the conditions for empty lines insertion based on the type of the current line and its relationship with the previous line.
2. Ensure consistency in handling decorators, imports, flow control lines, and depth levels to determine the correct number of empty lines to be inserted.
3. Update the logic to accurately handle those cases where the bug might be causing incorrect empty line insertion.
4. Consider revising the handling of decorators, imports, and flow control lines to align with the desired code formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the handling of `is_import`, depth check, and empty line determination logic has been adjusted to address the bug causing the inconsistent formatting output. The function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the conditions specified for different line types.
