## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before a given line based on certain conditions.
2. The failing test case suggests that the function is not handling comments within decorators correctly, resulting in a mismatch in the expected and actual output.
3. The error message specifically mentions that the empty lines before and after the comments in decorators are not handled properly by the function.
4. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles decorators and comments within decorators.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` does not properly handle comments within decorators. When encountering comments within decorators, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly handle comments within decorators. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted before and after comments within decorators.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    # Check for comments within decorators
    is_comment_within_decorator = is_decorator and current_line.is_comment
    if is_comment_within_decorator:
        return 2, 0

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check `is_comment_within_decorator` to correctly handle comments within decorators. This check ensures that when encountering comments within decorators, the function returns the correct number of empty lines to be inserted. This fix should address the issue reported by the failing test case.
