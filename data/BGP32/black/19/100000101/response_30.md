The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic that adjusts the number of empty lines to be inserted based on different conditions. The issue arises when updating the `before` variable within the while loop, where it sets `before` to a fixed value of 1 or 2, neglecting the need to consider the `max_allowed` variable.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for `before` calculation within the while loop to adhere to the `max_allowed` limit set earlier in the function. By ensuring that `before` does not exceed the `max_allowed` value, we can address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = min(before, 1 if depth != 0 else 2)

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return min(before or 1, max_allowed), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return min(before or 1, max_allowed), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable respects the `max_allowed` limit and adjusts the number of empty lines based on the given conditions. It should address the bug and produce the expected output for all test cases provided.
