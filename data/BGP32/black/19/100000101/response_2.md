Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it appears that the bug occurs in the section where the conditions are checked whether to insert empty lines based on the current line properties. The bug occurs because the logic in the function is not correctly handling the cases where empty lines should be inserted or not based on the current and previous lines.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions for inserting empty lines are correctly evaluated based on the properties of the current and previous lines. Additionally, we need to update the logic to maintain the correct state of `previous_defs` list to track the line depths.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, leaf_type: Any):
        self.leaf_type = leaf_type

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: List[Leaf], comments: List[Any], bracket_tracker: Any, inside_brackets: bool, is_decorator: bool = False, is_def: bool = False, 
                 is_class: bool = False, is_flow_control: bool = False, is_import: bool = False, is_yield: bool = False):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = comments
        self.bracket_tracker = bracket_tracker
        self.inside_brackets = inside_brackets
        self.is_decorator = is_decorator
        self.is_def = is_def
        self.is_class = is_class
        self.is_flow_control = is_flow_control
        self.is_import = is_import
        self.is_yield = is_yield

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self, previous_line: Line, previous_after: int, previous_defs: List[int]):
        self.previous_line = previous_line
        self.previous_after = previous_after
        self.previous_defs = previous_defs

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the properties of the current and previous lines. It also maintains the `previous_defs` list to track line depths correctly.
