After analyzing the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the logic surrounding `before` variable assignment and modification within the loop. The issue arises from not properly handling the condition checks and updating the `before` variable correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated based on specific conditions and retains its correct value throughout the function. We should also correctly handle updating the `previous_defs` list when needed.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on different conditions and that the `previous_defs` list is handled properly. The provided fixes should satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
