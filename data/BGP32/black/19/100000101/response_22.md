The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a logical error in the while loop that updates the `before` variable. The issue arises when `depth` is not equal to zero, it unnecessarily changes the `before` variable to 1 regardless of the actual value of `before`.

To fix this bug, we should only update the `before` variable to 1 if `depth` is greater than zero. Additionally, we should keep track of the original value of `before` before entering the while loop to maintain consistency.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected function

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    original_before = before  # keep track of original before value
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth > 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return original_before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (original_before or 1), 0

    return original_before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable maintains its original value in the scenarios where `depth` is not zero. Additionally, it tracks the original value of `before` before the loop and uses that value for the return statement. This revised function should now handle the given test cases correctly.
