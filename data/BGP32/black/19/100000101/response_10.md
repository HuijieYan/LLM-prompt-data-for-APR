The bug in the provided function lies in the logic to handle empty lines based on the depth of the current line and previous lines. The function is intended to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on certain conditions. However, the logic within the function is not correctly handling all possible cases leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions and calculations within the function to correctly determine the number of empty lines to be inserted. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function considers all relevant scenarios such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

Based on the expected input/output values for the buggy function, we can provide a corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth == 0:
        before = 2
    else:
        before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        else:
            return 2, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should fulfill the expected input/output requirements provided for the buggy function. Make sure to test this corrected function with various input cases to verify its correctness.
