### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the handling of the `before` variable. The current implementation resets the `before` variable to 1 if a certain condition is met in the while loop, which leads to incorrect output in some cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the while loop where the `before` variable is reset to 1 if a specific condition is met. This causes the value of `before` to be set to 1 or 2 despite the actual value being calculated correctly prior to the loop. As a result, the return value of the function is incorrect in certain cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should not reset the `before` variable inside the while loop. The value of `before` should be maintained as calculated on each iteration and not forcefully overridden. Additionally, we need to handle conditions properly to ensure the correct output for different cases.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By removing the unnecessary resetting of the `before` variable in the while loop, the corrected function should now properly handle the empty line calculation for different scenarios according to the expected input/output values.
