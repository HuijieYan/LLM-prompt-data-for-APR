### Analysis
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that determines the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- There are conditions in the method to handle different scenarios such as decorators, imports, flow control, etc.
- The bug seems to lie in the condition related to checking if the previous line is an import.
- The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of empty lines inside decorators.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by incorrectly handling empty lines inside decorators.
- The if condition that checks whether the previous line is an import is problematic.
- There is a possibility that empty lines are not correctly inserted based on the specific scenario of decorators and imports.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the condition related to checking if the previous line is an import so that empty lines are correctly inserted between imports and other lines.
- Ensure proper handling of decorators to avoid incorrect insertion of empty lines inside decorators.

### Updated Fixed Version of the Method

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Check if the current line is a decorator
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0  # Don't insert empty lines between decorators

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check if the current line is an import
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function to check if previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the adjustments as outlined in the updated code snippet, the issue related to incorrect empty line insertion inside decorators should be resolved. This fix should address the failing test cases and ensure the correct behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
