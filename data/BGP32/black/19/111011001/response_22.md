### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for handling empty lines before and after specific types of lines. The function is not correctly handling cases where it should insert empty lines based on certain conditions, leading to incorrect formatting of the output.

1. The function checks various properties of the `current_line` object, such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`, to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the line.

2. The function utilizes the `previous_line` attribute of the `EmptyLineTracker` class to compare properties of the current line with the previous one to decide on the number of empty lines.

3. Incorrect handling of conditions, especially related to decorators, imports, yields, and previous definitions, is leading to the incorrect insertion of empty lines, as shown in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for deciding when to insert empty lines before and after the current line based on the conditions defined in the function. Specifically, we need to address the incorrect conditions related to decorators, imports, yields, and previous definitions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator and not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.depth != 0:
            return 1, 0
        return 2, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the buggy logic that was causing incorrect inserts of empty lines. It provides a more accurate evaluation of the required empty lines based on the line properties and the relation with the previous line.
