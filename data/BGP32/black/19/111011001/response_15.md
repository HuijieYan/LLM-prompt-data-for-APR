### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional check that determines whether to insert empty lines before the currently processed line. The bug is related to handling previous lines that are marked as imports. The function incorrectly checks if `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of utilizing the `is_import` function to determine if the previous line is an import, leading to incorrect decisions regarding the insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional check involving imports by using the provided `is_import` function instead of directly checking `self.previous_line.is_import`. This change should ensure that the correct import status of the previous line is consistently and accurately determined.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: black_corrected.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
