### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions.
2. The function utilizes the `self` object of the `EmptyLineTracker` class to store and manipulate previous definitions and lines.
3. The bug occurs due to the usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` in the condition, but there is no `is_import` attribute/method defined within the `Line` class.
4. The absence of the `is_import` attribute in the `Line` class leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition that checks for `is_import` in the `previous_line` to avoid the AttributeError by adjusting the boolean condition to suit the available attributes in the `Line` class.
2. Revise the logic to handle the case appropriately even without the `is_import` attribute.
3. The return statements can also be checked and corrected to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the conditions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves[-1].value == "yield"
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now handle the conditions appropriately without causing an AttributeError and return the expected number of newlines based on the code logic.
