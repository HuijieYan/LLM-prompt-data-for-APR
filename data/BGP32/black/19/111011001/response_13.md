### Analysis
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The function contains multiple conditional checks based on the properties of the `current_line` and the previous line. It determines the number of newlines to insert based on various conditions related to decorators, definitions, imports, yield statements, and flow control.
- The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically related to the insertion of empty lines in the code.
- The function uses an incorrect comparison `self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` instead of the intended `self.previous_line.is_import` which causes issues.
- Based on the runtime values provided, the function fails to handle certain scenarios correctly, leading to incorrect calculation of newlines to insert.

### Bug Cause
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect check `self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` in the condition related to imports.
- The `is_import` function is defined outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class but within the same file, causing confusion between class properties and global functions when referencing it in the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the condition regarding imports to correctly check `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of the current check with `self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import`.
- Ensure that for all comparison statements related to line properties (is_import, is_decorator, etc.), access the properties directly from the `current_line` or `previous_line` objects without unnecessary additional conditions.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition `self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly assess the import scenarios and ensure the function calculates the required empty lines accurately.
