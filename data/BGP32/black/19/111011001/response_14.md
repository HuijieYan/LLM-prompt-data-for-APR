### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. There are multiple if condition checks based on the type of the current line and the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the currently processed line. The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before and after decorators, imports, and yields.

In the failing test case, the output expected has more empty lines than the actual output generated by the function. This indicates that the function is not calculating the correct number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions specified in the code.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, when the current line is a decorator, the function returns 0 and 0 for the number of empty lines before and after. The correct behavior should not insert empty lines for decorators.
  
2. In Case 2, when there is a function definition after a decorator, the function returns 2 and 0, which is incorrect. It should only include one empty line before the function definition.
  
3. In Case 3, when a decorator is followed by another decorator, the function calculates the number of empty lines incorrectly. It should return 2 and 0, but it returns 2 and 1.
  
4. In Case 4, similarly, when there are multiple decorators, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to include.
  
5. In Case 5, when handling comments within the decorators, the function again calculates the number of empty lines incorrectly.
  
6. In Case 6, when there are multiple decorators and comments intermixed, the function does not handle the situation correctly.
  
7. In Case 7, when there is a function definition after a decorator, the function is not inserting the correct number of empty lines.
  
8. In Case 8, when the depth increases, affecting the indentation level, the function fails to handle the number of empty lines correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the conditions for inserting empty lines and ensure that they are correctly handled based on the type of the current line and the previous line. We should focus on scenarios involving decorators, imports, and yields since these are where the bug manifestations are occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function after addressing the identified issues:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if not current_line.depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        return 0, 1 if current_line.depth else 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or (current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to correctly insert the required number of empty lines based on the conditions specified in the function.
