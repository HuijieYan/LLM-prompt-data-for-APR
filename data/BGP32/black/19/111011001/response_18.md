### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from attempting to use `self.previous_line` similarly to a function, which results in incorrect behavior, triggering the tests to fail. In the provided cases, the issue is primarily related to how the `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` properties are being accessed and checked.

1. In Case 1, when checking for `current_line.is_import`, it tries to call the `is_import` function from the `current_line` object, leading to the failure.

2. In Case 2, the incorrect behavior arises due to the use of `self.previous_line` as a function by trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`.

3. In Case 3, a similar issue occurs when attempting to use `self.previous_line` as a callable by checking `self.previous_line.is_yield`.

4. In Case 4, the problem originates from mistakenly applying `self.previous_line` like a function when verifying `self.previous_line.is_import`.

5. In Case 5, the bug is caused by trying to access `self.previous_line.is_yield` as if it were a function.

6. In Case 6, the failure stems from using `self.previous_line.is_decorator` incorrectly.

7. In Case 7, the bug arises from treating `self.previous_line` as a function while checking `self.previous_line.is_decorator`.

8. In Case 8, similar to the other cases, the issue occurs due to using `self.previous_line` as a function-like object when accessing `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To correct the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to update the section where `self.previous_line` properties are utilized. The key is to compare the `current_line` properties directly with boolean values, ensuring that `self.previous_line` is not being called as a function. By properly accessing the attributes of the `current_line` object, we can address the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import) and (not current_line.is_import) and (depth == self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield) and ((not current_line.is_yield) or (depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
``` 

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should no longer encounter the issues observed in the failing test cases, restoring its functionality and ensuring its proper execution.
