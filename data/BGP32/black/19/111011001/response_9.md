### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to calculate these empty lines.

The error message provided shows a failed test case related to comments in decorators, indicating a mismatch in the expected and actual output format of the code.

### 2. Identified Issue
The current implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function contains an issue in the comparison logic related to empty lines before and after the current line. Particularly, the conditions for handling decorators, imports, and yields are causing the incorrect addition of empty lines.

### 3. Bug Cause
- The function fails to properly handle the case when the previous line is an import (`self.previous_line.is_import`). The condition should check if the previous line is an import by calling the `is_import` function, but it wrongly references it as an attribute causing the condition to be always false.
- The logic for handling decorators and yields also seems to be incorrect, potentially leading to incorrect empty line calculation.

### 4. Proposed Fix
- Correctly call the `is_import` function to check if the previous line is an import.
- Review the conditions related to decorators and yields to ensure they are correctly calculating the empty lines.

### 5. Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By applying these fixes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case related to comments in decorators.
