### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function contains various conditional checks based on the properties of the `current_line` object and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` instance.

### Bug Identification
The bug lies in the logic related to determining when to include empty lines before and after the current line. Specifically, the issue arises when checking if the `current_line` is an import by calling `current_line.is_import`. The function is attempting to access `is_import` as an attribute of the `Line` object without defining such an attribute.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test cases, the `current_line.is_import` check is causing an issue because the `is_import` function is defined outside the class but being referenced as an attribute of `current_line`, which leads to an `AttributeError`.
2. Since `is_import` is not defined as an attribute of the `Line` object, the condition `current_line.is_import` fails and causes incorrect behavior in determining the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `is_import` function to return `True` or `False` based on the properties of the `Leaf` object passed to it.
2. Modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly call `is_import` with the appropriate `Leaf` object to determine if the current line is an import.

### Corrected Version
```python
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Check if the leaf represents an import
    return leaf.type == IMPORT  # assuming IMPORT is a predefined constant for imports

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0])  # Checking if the previous line was an import
            and not is_import(current_line.leaves[0])  # Checking if the current line is not an import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `is_import` is used appropriately to check if a line is an import. This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the function works correctly in determining the number of empty lines before and after each line.
