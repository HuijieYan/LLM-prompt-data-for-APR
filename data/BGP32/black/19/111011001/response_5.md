### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to how it handles the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function contains multiple conditional statements that check the characteristics of the current line and the previous line to decide on the number of empty lines to insert.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect manipulation of the `before` variable that tracks the number of empty lines needed before the current line.
2. Incorrect handling of the `previous_defs` variable which stores the depth of previous definitions.
3. Incorrect return values based on the conditions specified in the function.

#### Bug Cause:
1. The conditional checks involving `current_line.is_import` are incorrect. The function is directly comparing the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` and `previous_line` using `self.previous_line.is_import`. This comparison can lead to errors because `self.previous_line.is_import` will trigger a call to the `is_import` function defined outside the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which is not what is intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function does not call the `is_import` function externally and modifies the condition involving `current_line.is_import` to compare using the attribute directly.
2. Correct the logic for updating the `before` variable based on the conditions and the `depth` of the current line.
3. Ensure proper handling of the `previous_defs` list and update it according to the depth of the current line.

### Corrected Version of `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle the logic for determining the number of empty lines more accurately and avoid the error caused by improperly comparing the `is_import` attribute.
