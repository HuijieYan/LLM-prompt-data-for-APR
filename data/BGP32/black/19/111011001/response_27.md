### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line in the context of a code formatter.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of `is_import` in the function. The function uses a check `self.previous_line.is_import` which should be `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual outputs after formatting code with comments within decorators.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to checking if the previous line is an import statement.
5. The corrected version of the function will correctly check if the previous line was an import statement by calling the `is_import` function.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the check for the previous line being an import statement to `is_import(self.previous_line)`, we ensure that the function correctly handles the case and should now pass the failing test.
