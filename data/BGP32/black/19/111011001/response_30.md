### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has a logical error in checking whether the current line is an import. The issue arises because the condition `self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` is used to determine if the previous line is an import. However, the attribute `is_import` is mistakenly assumed as a direct method, which is incorrect. The function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` should be called, but it is not utilized correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function with the appropriate parameters to determine if the current or previous line is an import. By invoking `is_import(self.previous_line)`, we can correctly check if the previous line was an import. Additionally, we should ensure that the `is_import` method is accessible within the scope of the `empty_line_tracker` module.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the bug analysis and fix strategy, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the usage of `is_import` and ensuring its availability in the context of `EmptyLinesTracker`, the function should now correctly handle determining if the previous line is an import.
