### Bug analysis:
The bug lies in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. There is an issue with the conditions for checking previous lines and determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. The function checks various line types and certain properties of the current and previous lines to decide on the number of empty lines. One specific issue is with the conditional check `self.previous_line.is_import` which is causing the function to raise an assertion error in the failing test.

### Bug explanation:
The issue arises when the function checks if the `previous_line` is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, the `is_import` check is incorrectly implemented and is not actually calling the `is_import` function defined in the file. It should use the defined function `is_import(leaf)` to determine if the line is an import.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Update the `is_import` check to properly call the `is_import` function.
2. Use the correct function to identify if the current or previous line is an import line.

### Corrected code:
```python
from typing import Tuple

# Correct is_import check function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By fixing the `is_import` check and using the correct function call, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line, resolving the assertion error in the failing test.
