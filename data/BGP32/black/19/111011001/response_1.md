### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to return the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions related to the current line and the previous line. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that lead to failing tests:

1. There is a check `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import`, but `is_import` is a function and not an attribute or property of `Line`, causing an error.
2. The logic for updating the `before` variable is not consistent. It is updated multiple times based on different conditions, leading to incorrect values.
3. The logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted is not accurately implemented in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the failing tests, the following changes can be made:
1. Correct the use of `is_import` by invoking the function `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead of accessing it as an attribute.
2. Simplify the updating of the `before` variable based on the conditions to ensure correctness.
3. Refactor the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted based on different line types and relationships.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing tests.
