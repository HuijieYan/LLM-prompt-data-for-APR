### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditions checking the `is_import` attribute of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. The buggy function incorrectly directly compares them as attributes rather than calling the `is_import` function to check if the line is an import line. This results in the program crashing when trying to access an attribute that the object does not have, leading to the reported assertion errors in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Add a call to the `is_import` function to correctly check if the line is an import line.
2. Fix the conditions that incorrectly access the `is_import` attribute without calling the function.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line) and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the corrections described above, the function should now properly handle the conditions related to checking if a line is an import line, and the failing tests should pass successfully.
