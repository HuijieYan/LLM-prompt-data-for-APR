### Bug analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition where it checks whether the `previous_line` is an import or yield to determine the number of empty lines to insert. The comparison is done incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior.

1. In Case 2, the function incorrectly returns 0 for both counts of empty lines when it should return `1` as per the condition check.
2. In Case 5, the function also returns incorrectly by omitting the empty lines where one should be inserted according to the conditions.
3. In Case 8, the function incorrectly sets `max_allowed` to 1 when in fact it should be 2 due to the depth check, leading to the wrong number of empty lines being returned.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison of the `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` properties with the `previous_line`. This correction will ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the defined conditions.

### Corrected function:

```python
# Required import for dataclass decorator
from dataclasses import dataclass

# The buggy function corrected version
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet. It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines. Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will check the import and yield conditions properly, leading to the correct number of empty lines being returned according to the defined rules.
