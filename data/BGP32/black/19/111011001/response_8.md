### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditions used to determine when to insert empty lines before and after the current line. The logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields is flawed, causing incorrect empty line behavior and leading to failing tests.

1. The function improperly handles the case when the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import. This results in the wrong number of empty lines being inserted.
2. The condition checking for yields also does not consider the depth of the previous line, causing incorrect empty line adjustments.
3. There are issues with maintaining `previous_defs` list, causing unexpected behavior when determining the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Correct the condition for handling imports and adjust the empty line count accordingly.
2. Update the logic for yields to consider the depth of the previous line.
3. Ensure proper maintenance of the `previous_defs` list to correctly track previous line depths.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return before, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.is_yield and depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions and handling of import, yield, and previous depth tracking, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
