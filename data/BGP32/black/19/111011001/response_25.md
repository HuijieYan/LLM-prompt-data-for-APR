### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the check for whether the previous line is an import. The function is trying to access the attribute `is_import` directly on the `Line` object, but this functionality has been moved to a separate function called `is_import`, which is not being properly utilized in the current function.

The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output related to empty lines. This inconsistency is likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines based on different conditions in the code.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function tries to access `is_import` directly on the `current_line` object, but the proper way to check for import status is to call the `is_import` function defined in the same module.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to properly use the `is_import` function instead of accessing the `is_import` attribute directly on the `Line` object.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Assuming the required imports are already present

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function `is_import` is called with the appropriate `Line` object to determine if the line represents an import. This change will ensure that the correct logic is used to handle empty lines based on the import status, fixing the bug in the process.
