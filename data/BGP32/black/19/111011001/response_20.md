### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the use of `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line is an import statement. The `self.previous_line` object itself does not have an `is_import` attribute or method associated with it. Therefore, trying to access `is_import` on `self.previous_line` results in an AttributeError, leading to the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if the `self.previous_line` object is an import statement directly. We can achieve this by making use of the `is_import` function that is declared at the beginning of the same file as the `is_import` function specifically checks if a given leaf is an import. By using this function with the first leaf of the `self.previous_line`, we can correctly determine if the previous line is an import statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function
I'll update the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly check if the previous line is an import statement by using the `is_import` function on the first leaf of the `self.previous_line`.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0]):
        if not current_line.is_import:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly determine if the previous line is an import statement using the `is_import` function and the first leaf of `self.previous_line`. This updated version should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
