### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of conditions related to previous lines' properties in the code. The function is responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions related to the line's depth, properties, and the previous lines.

One of the key issues causing the failing test is that the function incorrectly checks for `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `current_line.is_decorator`, but it should be checking `self.previous_line.is_import`, `self.previous_line.is_yield`, and `self.previous_line.is_decorator` instead. This incorrect reference leads to incorrect behavior when determining the number of empty lines needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly references the properties of the `previous_line` instead of the current line when making decisions based on the previous line's characteristics. Additionally, we should make sure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed based on specific conditions is correctly implemented.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By correctly referencing the properties of the `previous_line` and adjusting the logic for determining the number of empty lines needed in different scenarios, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
