### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is primarily related to the conditional statements that handle the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The main issue lies in the conditions that determine when to insert empty lines based on various properties of the current and previous lines. The error message provides a comparison between the expected and actual outputs, highlighting the discrepancies in the insertion of empty lines.

1. The function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines before and after specific types of lines such as decorators, defs, imports, and flow control statements.
2. The logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after certain lines is flawed, leading to incorrect output in some scenarios.
3. The function does not accurately maintain the state of previous lines and their properties, causing incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Update the conditional logic to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the type of line being processed.
2. Improve the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after each line, considering the context of the current and previous lines.
3. Ensure that the state of previous lines and their properties are properly maintained to guide the correct insertion of empty lines.

### Bug-fixed Version
Here is the bug-fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed_before = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed_before = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed_before)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        if depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By addressing the conditional statements and improving the logic for determining empty lines insertion, this fixed version should resolve the discrepancies observed in the failing tests.
