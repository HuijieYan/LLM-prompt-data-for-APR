### Analysis
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has multiple conditional checks based on the attributes of the `current_line` parameter.
- The function uses `self.previous_defs`, `self.previous_line`, and `current_line` attributes to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
- There are conditions related to decorators, flow control, imports, yield statements, etc., to decide the empty lines.
- The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of previous line attributes and their comparison with the current line attributes.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks if the previous line was an import statement `self.previous_line.is_import` and the current line is not an import statement `not current_line.is_import`. The condition is not correctly checking for `is_import` function as it is referring to `self.previous_line.is_import` directly instead of calling the `is_import` function.

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import statement.
- We need to update this fix wherever similar comparisons are made for other attributes as well within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the`_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the import statements correctly and pass the failing test cases.
