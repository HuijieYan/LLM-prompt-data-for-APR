### Analysis and Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines()` is not correctly handling the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. There are several issues:
1. The condition for checking if the previous line is an import is incorrect as it compares `self.previous_line.is_import` directly, which will result in an attribute error since `self.previous_line` is an object of class `Line` and not `bool`.
2. The logic for updating the `previous_defs` list is incorrect as it always sets `before` to 1 if `depth` is true, impacting the calculation of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition for checking if the previous line is an import by invoking the `is_import()` function instead.
2. Correct the logic for updating the `previous_defs` list and `before` variable based on the depth.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making the suggested fixes, the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line, passing the failing test cases.
