### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function uses various conditions based on the attributes of the `current_line` object and the state of the tracker to determine the number of empty lines.
3. The buggy part is with the condition that checks for `self.previous_line.is_import` within the function.
4. The buggy function fails when trying to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line` which is an instance of `Line` and not the `is_import` function from the module. This leads to the 'AttributeError: 'Line' object has no attribute 'is_import'' error during execution.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is trying to access an attribute `is_import` directly on an instance of the `Line` object instead of calling the function `is_import`.

### Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, you need to call the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as the parameter instead of trying to access it directly as an attribute.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` the bug is corrected, and the function will now correctly check if the previous line is an import statement.
