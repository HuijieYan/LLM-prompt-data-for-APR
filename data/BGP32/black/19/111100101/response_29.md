### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the comparison involving `self.previous_line.is_import`. The buggy function checks if `self.previous_line` has an `is_import` attribute and tries to access it. However, `self.previous_line` is an instance of the `Line` class and does not have an `is_import` attribute. This causes an AttributeError when trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic where `self.previous_line.is_import` is accessed. We should update the conditional check to compare the `self.previous_line` with a function call to `is_import` instead. The provided `is_import` function is expected to return a boolean value indicating whether the given `Leaf` object represents an import. By using this function, we can properly check if the `self.previous_line` is an import statement.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this change in the problematic conditional block, we ensure that the correct method `is_import` is called to determine if the `self.previous_line` represents an import statement. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
