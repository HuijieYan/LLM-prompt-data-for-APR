### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. It is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. The function seems to have a bug related to checking whether the `current_line` is an import statement, which leads to incorrect calculations.

### Bug Identification
The bug is located in the following conditional check:
```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0
```
The bug lies in checking `self.previous_line.is_import`. The `is_import` method should be called from the global `is_import` function instead of directly calling it on `self.previous_line`. This incorrect call causes the function to fail in certain scenarios where the actual class method should be called.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function tries to access the `is_import` property directly on `self.previous_line`, assuming it is a boolean attribute. However, `self.previous_line` is an instance of the `Line` class, which does not have an `is_import` property directly accessible. Consequently, this condition leads to incorrect behavior in determining the number of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for imports. We should call the `is_import` global function on `self.previous_line` to correctly identify whether the previous line was an import statement. This change will ensure that the correct logic is applied to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.is_import(self.previous_line) and not self.is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By calling the global `is_import` function on `self.previous_line`, we ensure that the correct logic is applied to check for import statements, and the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed.
