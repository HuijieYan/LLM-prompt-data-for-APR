## Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. 

Upon analyzing the function and the failing test, it appears that the bug lies in the condition where it checks if the previous line is an import (`current_line.is_import`) and the current line is not an import. This condition is incorrect and should be fixed to properly handle these cases.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs in the buggy function when it incorrectly checks if the previous line was an import (`self.previous_line.is_import`) and the current line is not an import (`not current_line.is_import`) to determine the number of newlines to be inserted. Due to this incorrect condition, the function is not behaving as expected when handling import-related cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition that checks for the import-related scenario. We should ensure that we correctly handle cases where the previous line was an import and the current line is not an import. We also need to address other conditions that affect the calculation of newlines in the function to ensure all cases are handled accurately.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the condition related to import handling, the function should now correctly determine the number of newlines to be inserted before and after the current line based on the specified conditions in each case.
