### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions such as depth, presence of leaves, type of line, and previous line information.
2. The buggy function has several conditional statements that check the attributes of the current line and the previous line to calculate the number of empty lines needed.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of attributes between the current and previous lines, especially when checking for import-related conditions.
4. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the line due to incorrect comparison conditions.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the conditions involving the comparison of attributes between the current and previous lines to ensure accurate calculation of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_line is None:
        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        return 0, 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    # Check and handle conditions related to decorators
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    # Handle flow control related conditions
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check and handle import-related conditions
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()  # Corrected function call to check is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Check and handle yield-related conditions
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the necessary corrections in the condition checks related to import and yield, the function should now calculate the correct number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the specified conditions.
