The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of the conditionals and assignments. The function is not correctly updating the `before` variable and `self.previous_defs` list, which leads to incorrect results when determining the number of empty lines to insert.

To fix the bug, we should update the `before` variable based on the conditions and ensure that `self.previous_defs` is updated correctly. Additionally, we need to account for the cases where the function should return different values based on the conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count('\n'), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ''

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < depth]

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass all the failing test cases and provide the expected results for the input parameters given in each case.
