### Bug analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the condition block related to checking if `current_line` is an import or a yield statement. The buggy condition block is using `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line was an import statement. However, the `is_import` function is not actually getting called to check this condition as it should be.

- The `is_import` function is defined to determine if a leaf represents an import, but it is not being utilized correctly in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to check if the previous line was an import statement.
- Due to the incorrect usage, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is always evaluating to `False`, leading to incorrect logic in determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
1. Utilize the `is_import` function to correctly check if the previous line was an import statement.
2. Update the condition block related to import statements to use the return value of the `is_import` function instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By utilizing the `is_import` function to correctly check if the previous line was an import statement, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected number of empty lines before and after the current line.
