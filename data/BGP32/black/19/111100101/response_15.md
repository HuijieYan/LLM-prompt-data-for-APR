### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a `_maybe_empty_lines` method that determines the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the current line being processed.
2. The method checks various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` instances to determine the number of empty lines required.
3. The bug lies in the comparison `current_line.is_import` is incorrectly checked as a method instead of a property and erroneously compared with `self.previous_line.is_import`.
4. The erroneous comparison results in the method not working as intended and failing to determine the correct number of empty lines needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the comparison of `current_line.is_import` to access the property correctly and compare it with `True` or `False`.
2. Update the logic around the import check to align with the correct property comparison.
3. Ensure that the conditions and comparison within the method align with the expected behavior for determining the number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the comparison of `current_line.is_import` and ensuring the logic aligns with the intended behavior, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
