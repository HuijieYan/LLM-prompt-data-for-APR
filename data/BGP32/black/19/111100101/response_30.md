### Analysis
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class is defined with a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function has several conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines based on various conditions such as whether the current line is a decorator, flow control, import, yield, etc.
3. The bug lies in the condition where it checks for `current_line.is_import` which is supposed to call the `is_import` function that checks if the current line is an import. However, the implementation mistakenly checks `current_line.is_import`.
4. The bug is caused by a typo in referencing the `is_import` function within the `if` condition.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the reference to the `is_import` function by changing `current_line.is_import` to `is_import(current_line)` within the conditional block.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(self.previous_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this change, the function now correctly calls the `is_import` function to check if the current line is an import, thus resolving the bug.
