### Analysis
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function initializes `max_allowed` to 1 by default, which may be changed to 2 if `current_line.depth` is 0.
3. The function then processes certain conditions related to the current line properties and the previous line to decide the number of newlines to be added before and after the current line. However, there is a logical error in the comparison related to the `is_import` property of the lines.
4. The bug seems to be in the conditional check `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`, where the `is_import` property of the lines is not checked correctly.
5. The fixes need to correct this logical error to accurately determine whether to insert empty lines based on the `is_import` property.
6. The function needs to update the `max_allowed` properly for each case to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function checks for the `is_import` property of the current and previous lines. Due to the incorrect comparison using `self.previous_line.is_import` without calling the `is_import` function, the condition does not work as intended. This leads to incorrect decisions on inserting empty lines based on the `is_import` property.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Use the `is_import` function to correctly determine if a line is an import line.
2. Update the comparison related to `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` to use the `is_import` function.
3. Ensure that the `max_allowed` variable is updated correctly based on the depth of the current line and other conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these fixes, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on the properties of the lines and previous line.
