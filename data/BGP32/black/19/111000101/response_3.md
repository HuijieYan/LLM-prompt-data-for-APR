### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. However, there are some logical errors in the implementation that make the function incorrect. Here are the main issues:
1. The conditions for determining the number of empty lines are not correctly checking the nature of the current line and the previous line.
2. The logic for managing `self.previous_defs` is flawed and may lead to incorrect results.
3. Incorrect handling of decorator lines and import lines.

### Bug Cause
1. The function improperly resets the `before` variable in the case where the previous line is a decorator or import line. This leads to incorrect calculations for the number of empty lines.
2. The logic for managing `self.previous_defs` is missing a proper update when encountering certain types of lines, resulting in improper handling of the required empty lines.
3. The condition for checking if the current line is an import line is incorrectly implemented, leading to a faulty comparison.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bugs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the logic to correctly determine the number of potential empty lines before and after the current line based on the line types. We also need to ensure proper maintenance of the `self.previous_defs` list to track the depth of the previous lines accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import() and not current_line.is_import:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the logical errors and should now be able to correctly calculate the required number of extra empty lines based on the line types and context.
