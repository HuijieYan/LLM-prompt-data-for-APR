The issue in the buggy function lies in the condition checking for `current_line.is_import`. The function erroneously references `self.previous_line.is_import` which might not be accurate in determining whether the current line is an import or not. Additionally, the comparison `depth == self.previous_line.depth` is also faulty and may lead to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition check for imports and properly handle the depth comparison. We can directly use the `is_import` function defined in the same file for checking if the current line is an import or not. Also, we need to update the way we handle the `self.previous_defs` list to ensure proper tracking of previous definitions' depths.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the expected input/output values provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_import(current_line): # Check if the current line is an import
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues with the buggy function and produce the expected output values for the given test cases.
