### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the number of extra empty lines required. The bug seems to originate from the condition where the function checks if `self.previous_line.is_import`. This check is incorrect because `is_import` is a separate function, not a property of `Line`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly tries to access the property `is_import` of the object `self.previous_line`, which should not exist. Instead, there is a separate function `is_import` defined in the module.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition related to `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function on `self.previous_line` wherever necessary.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the logic based on the output of the `is_import` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    # Check if the previous line has the required properties
    is_previous_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line)
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_previous_line_import and not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
