### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The bug arises from incorrectly checking whether the previous line is an import within the class, which should actually call the `is_import` function from outside the class.

### Bug
The bug occurs due to the misuse of the `is_import` attribute in the class instead of calling the `is_import` function from outside the class.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the conditional block that checks for imports to correctly call the `is_import` function from outside the class.
2. Ensure that the correct flow control and yield conditions are evaluated.

### Fix
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
            
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and is_import(current_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This fix improves the bug by using the `is_import` function correctly to check for imports outside the class definition.
