The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect check for the presence of an `is_import` attribute in the `current_line` object. The `current_line` object does not have an `is_import` attribute directly defined in the class. Instead, the `is_import` function is used to determine if a line is an import statement based on the contents of the line.

To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` object as the argument to correctly determine if the line is an import statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

# Assume these classes are defined somewhere in the code
class Line:
    pass

class Leaf:
    pass

# The function from the same file, but not the same class that is called by the buggy function
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    pass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not is_import(current_line)
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now correctly utilizes the `is_import` function to check if the previous line is an import statement and adjust the empty lines accordingly. The function should now return the expected values based on the test cases provided.
