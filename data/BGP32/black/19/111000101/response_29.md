The buggy function is `_maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]`. The function is designed to return the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.

Upon analysis, the bug arises from the incorrect comparison involving the function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`. This function is mistakenly called as a property of `current_line`, resulting in a TypeError. The actual function `is_import` is a standalone function and should not be accessed via `current_line` directly.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function properly outside of the `current_line` context as it is designed. We can pass the appropriate parameters to it instead of trying to access it as a property of an object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the `is_import` function call and ensuring it is a separate function call outside the object context, the TypeError issue will be resolved, and the function should work correctly based on the expected input/output values provided.
