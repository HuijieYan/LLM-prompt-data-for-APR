### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to calculate the number of potential empty lines before and after the current line based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to the `is_import` function call within the if condition related to import statements. However, the `is_import` function is not defined within the scope of the provided code snippet, so it might be causing an error. To resolve this bug, we need to handle this condition appropriately, and ensure that the function works correctly based on the given input parameters and expected output values.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when checking the condition related to import statements. The code tries to call the `is_import` method on objects of type `Line`, which is not defined within the given context. This leads to a NameError as there is no such method available. As a result, the function encounters an error while attempting to access the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line` object.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case involving `is_import` attribute more gracefully. We should remove the inappropriate condition related to `is_import` and handle it based on the available attributes and properties of `current_line` and `previous_line`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    # Handle the condition involving previous_line and import statements
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.leaves and self.previous_line.leaves[-1].value == 'import':
        depth = current_line.depth
        return (before or 1), 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1    
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function removes the invalid check for `is_import` and handles the condition involving imports using leaf values for a more robust implementation.
