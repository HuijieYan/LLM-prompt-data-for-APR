### Buggy Function Analysis
1. The `maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function uses several conditions based on the attributes of the `current_line` object and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` instance.

### Bug Identification
1. The bug lies in the condition that checks `self.previous_line.is_import` in the function. It incorrectly calls `current_line.is_import` directly on `self.previous_line`, which causes an AttributeError since `self.previous_line` does not have the attribute `is_import`.
2. The correct function call should be `is_import(self.previous_line)` as defined in the `is_import` function outside the class.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)` in the section where the bug is identified.
2. Make sure to import the `is_import` function at the beginning of the script.
3. Verify that the rest of the conditions and logic in the function are correctly handling the cases for determining empty lines.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version of the function should address the bug by calling the `is_import` function correctly and maintaining the expected logic for determining empty lines based on the provided input parameters.
