### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to add before the current line of code based on certain conditions. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a discrepancy in the number of empty lines added before and after the comment in a decorator.

### Potential error location:
1. The logic for handling empty lines and decorators might be causing the issue.
2. The conditions checking for import statements, yield statements, and flow control statements could also be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
The error message indicates a difference in expected and actual output due to improper handling of empty lines before comments within a decorator. This could be related to incorrect conditions in `_maybe_empty_lines` function, leading to the wrong number of empty lines being inserted.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check and correct the logic related to decorators and empty lines.
2. Verify the conditions related to import statements, yield statements, and flow control.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Changes made:
1. The condition checking for imports has been updated to call the `is_import` function instead of directly accessing the attribute. This ensures consistency in checking for imports.
2. Other conditions remain the same to maintain the functionality.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
