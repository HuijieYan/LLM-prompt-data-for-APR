### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted between code lines.
2. The issue is likely related to the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the type of the current line and the previous line.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual formatted code, specifically related to comments within decorators.
4. The bug seems to be causing incorrect handling of comments within the decorator block, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the condition that checks if the previous line is an import. Inside this condition, the function incorrectly references `self.previous_line.is_import` when it should be using the function `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition where `self.previous_line.is_import` is checked to instead use the separate function `is_import(self.previous_line)` to properly determine if the previous line is an import.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling comments within decorators is correct to prevent incorrect insertion of empty lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By using `is_import(self.previous_line)` instead of `self.previous_line.is_import`, the corrected version properly checks if the previous line is an import. This change should address the bug causing the incorrect insertion of empty lines.
