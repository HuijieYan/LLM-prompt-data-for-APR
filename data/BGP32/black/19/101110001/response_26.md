## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the logic of inserting empty lines in the formatted code.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to an incorrect insertion of empty lines, causing the assertion error.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code.
4. The cause of the bug is likely related to the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that determines when to insert empty lines before or after certain code elements.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that determines when to insert empty lines before or after certain code elements. This incorrect logic results in an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted, leading to the formatting mismatch observed in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review and adjust the logic inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines. Specifically, focus on the conditions that determine when to insert empty lines before or after decorators, imports, flow control, etc. Ensure that the logic aligns with the expected formatting behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the addition of the `is_import` function is called to correctly identify when the previous line is an import, and the logic for handling empty lines around imports is adjusted accordingly. This should resolve the issue causing the failing test.
