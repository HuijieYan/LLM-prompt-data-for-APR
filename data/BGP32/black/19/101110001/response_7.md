### Analysis:
1. The `assertFormatEqual` function is used in the failing test to compare the expected and actual formatted code.
2. The error message indicates a failure in the comparison of the expected and actual code.
3. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to be handling the insertion of empty lines in the code formatting process based on certain conditions.
4. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the number of empty lines being inserted in certain situations, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual code.
5. Specifically, the error message points towards differences in the amount of empty lines before and after comments and decorators in the code.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic implemented in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that determines the number of empty lines to insert before and after certain code elements like comments and decorators. The incorrect logic is leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being inserted, causing the formatting mismatch.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and correct the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the specific conditions.
2. Pay special attention to the conditions related to comments, decorators, and other elements that might require a specific number of empty lines before or after them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- Changed the calculation for `newlines` to correctly handle the depth condition.
- Updated the condition related to imports to call the `is_import` function for comparison.
- Ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the specific conditions for comments, decorators, import statements, etc.
