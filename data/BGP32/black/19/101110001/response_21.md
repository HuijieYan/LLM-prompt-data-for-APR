### Analysis:
1. The `is_import` function referenced by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not defined within the provided code.
2. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is trying to call `is_import` on `current_line` but the actual function definition is missing.
3. The failing test is related to comparing expected and actual output, indicating a formatting issue caused by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_maybe_empty_lines` function trying to call the `is_import` method which is not defined in the provided code. This causes a comparison failure in the test case due to incorrect formatting being applied.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `is_import` method or modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to avoid calling the `is_import` method.
2. Ensure that the formatting logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is correct to avoid the comparison failure in the test case.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I removed the call to `current_line.is_import` since the `is_import` method is not defined. This should prevent the comparison failure in the test case.
