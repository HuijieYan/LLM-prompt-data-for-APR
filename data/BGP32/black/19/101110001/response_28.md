### Analysis:
1. The `assertFormatEqual` method of the test is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
2. The bug is likely within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, specifically in the conditions that handle decorators and imports.
3. The error message indicates a difference in the output related to comments within decorators.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of decorators and imports in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is correct and aligns with the expected behavior.
5. The issue seems to be related to the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before certain types of lines like decorators and imports.

### Correction:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with a call to the `is_import` function to correctly identify import lines.
- This change ensures that the import handling is consistent with the method `is_import` and aligns with the expected behavior of the function.
- By using the `is_import` function to check for imports, we avoid potential inconsistencies and errors that may have occurred due to the incorrect condition.
