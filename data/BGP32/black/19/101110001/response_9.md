### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling empty lines in the code formatting process.
2. The error in the test case `test_comment_in_decorator` suggests that there is an issue with handling comments in decorators.
3. The error message shows a comparison mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code, specifically related to comments and empty lines in decorators.
4. The function is supposed to manage empty lines based on different conditions related to the structure of the code.
5. The bug may stem from how the function handles decorators and their related empty lines.
6. There seems to be an issue in the handling of empty lines in decorators, leading to the incorrect formatting in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to review how the `_maybe_empty_lines` function handles decorators and their corresponding empty lines. Specifically, ensure that the function correctly manages the insertion of empty lines before and after decorators to match the expected formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 1

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to handle decorators separately and ensure the empty lines are inserted correctly before and after decorators. Also, I modified the condition to check if the previous line is an import using the `is_import` function to fix the handling of imports.
