### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line. The bug seems to be related to how empty lines are handled in various scenarios. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect as there is no method `is_import` defined on `Leaf`.
2. The condition for checking `current_line.is_flow_control` might not be correctly evaluated.
3. The logic for handling `is_decorators` and `is_def` cases might be incorrect as well.

### Bug Cause:
The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is encountering an `AssertionError` because the expected and actual output strings do not match. This is likely due to incorrect handling of empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the condition related to `self.previous_line.is_import` by checking `is_import` function from another part of the file.
2. Review and correct the handling of empty lines in various scenarios based on the logic and conditions provided.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the condition related to `self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with a call to the `is_import` function that checks if the previous line is an import. This should help in accurately handling the scenarios where empty lines need to be inserted based on the previous and current lines' properties.
