### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to handle cases where empty lines need to be inserted or removed based on the current line's characteristics and the previous line's characteristics.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is testing the formatting behavior when comments are present in decorators.
3. The error message indicates that the expected formatting does not match the actual formatting on some lines with comments in decorators.
4. The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of decorators containing comments in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, leading to the inappropriate insertion of empty lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of decorators with comments. When a line with a comment in a decorator is encountered, the function does not appropriately determine if empty lines should be inserted or not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to ensure that proper checks are in place to handle cases where comments are present in decorators. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic around decorators to handle comments correctly and determine whether empty lines should be inserted or not in those cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import()
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_decorator
        and current_line.indent - self.previous_line.indent == 1
        and not current_line.leaves[0].source.strip().startswith("#")
    ):
        return 0, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the function, additional checks have been added to handle the case where a line with a comment in a decorator is encountered. This ensures that empty lines are inserted or removed correctly based on the presence of comments in decorators.
