## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

### Buggy Function `_maybe_empty_lines`
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for handling the number of empty lines and newlines to be inserted based on certain conditions when formatting code.
- It has several conditional branches based on the properties of the `current_line` object and the previous line.
- The function interacts with properties of the `current_line` and other related objects to determine the appropriate number of empty lines to insert.
- The issue seems to be related to determining when to insert empty lines before or after certain types of lines.

### Failing Test `test_comment_in_decorator`
- The test seems to be related to checking the formatting output of Black when there is a comment in a decorator.
- The test reads data from a file, processes it using `fs` function (presumably a function that formats code using Black), and then compares the formatted output with an expected value.
- The test fails with an `AssertionError` due to a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted outputs.

### Error Message
- The error message shows an `AssertionError` with a detailed comparison of the expected and actual formatted outputs.
- It indicates a difference after the `@property` decorator and comments `# TODO: Y` and `# TODO: Z`, where extra empty lines are being added in the actual output.

## Bug Cause
- One possible cause of the bug could be related to the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, where incorrect decisions are made about the number of empty lines to insert before certain types of lines.
- The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` exposes the bug when a comment is present in a decorator, triggering the incorrect insertion of extra empty lines in the output.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, it's essential to carefully analyze the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that the correct conditions are being checked and the appropriate number of empty lines are inserted based on the context.
- Specifically, the logic regarding when to insert empty lines before or after decorators, imports, yield statements, etc., needs to be revisited to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        return 1, 0 if current_line.depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the conditional branches for inserting empty lines before or after certain types of lines, improving the logic to better handle cases like comments in decorators. Make sure to test this corrected version against the failing test to confirm that the bug is fixed.
