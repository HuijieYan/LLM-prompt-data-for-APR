## Analysis:
- The `assertFormatEqual` method in the failing test is comparing the `expected` and `actual` output.
- The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.
- The failing test involves a scenario where comments are present within decorators in the input source code.
- The `is_import` function is called within the buggy `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition checking for `self.previous_line.is_import` might be causing issues.
2. The handling of empty lines before decorators or flow control statements may be incorrect.
3. The logic related to the handling of `is_import` and `is_yield` scenarios is likely problematic.

## Bug Cause:
The bug might be caused due to incorrect handling of empty lines before decorators or flow control statements. Additionally, the comparison involving `self.previous_line.is_import` may not be working as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for handling empty lines before decorators or flow control statements is correct.
2. Verify the comparison involving `self.previous_line.is_import` and make necessary adjustments.
3. Check the conditions related to `is_import` and `is_yield` scenarios and correct the logic if needed.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` for proper function call. Additionally, I suggested verifying the logic for handling empty lines before decorators or flow control statements.
