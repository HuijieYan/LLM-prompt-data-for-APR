### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to determine if empty lines should be inserted before the current line of code. 
2. The issue seems to be related to the condition for checking if the previous line is an import statement. The function that checks for imports is `is_import`, but the conditional check in `_maybe_empty_lines` is `self.previous_line.is_import`, which will not work correctly as it is trying to access the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object directly.
3. The failing test is related to comments being inserted incorrectly due to the buggy behavior of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to reassess how the import statement is checked in `_maybe_empty_lines` and ensure that the correct condition is used to compare the types of lines.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to update the condition for checking if the previous line is an import statement, using the `is_import` function properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between imports.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

With the corrected version of the function above, the issue related to checking import statements should be resolved, and the failing test should pass without any errors.
