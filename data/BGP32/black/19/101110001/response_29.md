### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling whether to insert empty lines in the formatted code based on different conditions such as indentation depth, type of line, previous line information, etc. The function is not correctly identifying whether the `current_line` is an import or a decorator, which leads to the test failure.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the condition where the function checks if the `current_line` is an import line:
```python
elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
    return (before or 1), 0
```
The function is trying to determine if the current line is an import by checking `current_line.is_import` but there is no check in the function to correctly identify if the current line is an import. It seems like a missing implementation or incorrect condition checking.

### Cause of the Bug:
Due to the missing or incorrect implementation of identifying the current line as an import, the function is unable to correctly handle situations where the current line is an import line. This leads to incorrect insertion of empty lines and formatting issues, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly identify when the `current_line` is an import line. We should use the `is_import` function defined in the same file to determine if the line is an import. This change will ensure that the function behaves as expected and correctly handles import lines.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if previous line is an import
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly uses the `is_import` function to determine if the `previous_line` is an import line. This change ensures that the correct check is performed for identifying import lines, fixing the bug in the function.
