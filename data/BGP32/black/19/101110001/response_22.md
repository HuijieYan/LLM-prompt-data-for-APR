### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is used to determine the number of empty lines to insert before a specific line.
2. The error occurs during the `test_comment_in_decorator` test where the actual output does not match the expected output.
3. Looking at the error message, it seems that the buggy behavior is related to handling comments and decorators, which affects the formatting of the output.
4. The buggy function is not correctly handling the scenarios involving comments, decorators, and empty lines, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a line with comments or decorators. This leads to incorrect formatting of the output.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle scenarios involving comments, decorators, and empty lines.
2. Ensure that the function returns the appropriate number of empty lines based on the conditions specified.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the condition related to checking imports, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle comments, decorators, and imports correctly, passing the failing test.
