### Analysis:
- The `assertFormatEqual` function is failing because the expected and actual outputs are not matching.
- The `is_import` function is being called inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function but it is not defined within the scope of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
- The error message indicates that the differences in the output are due to the handling of empty lines.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
- The condition `self.previous_line.is_import` is comparing the `is_import` function object directly instead of calling it as a function.

### Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `is_import` function is correctly called and returns a boolean value for the comparison condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the change to correctly call the `is_import` function within the comparison condition, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test.
