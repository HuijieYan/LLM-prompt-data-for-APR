### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the logic of determining the number of empty lines to insert between two lines of code.
2. One specific condition in the function checks for situations where the previous line is an import statement by using `self.previous_line.is_import`. This condition is supposed to call the `is_import` function from the same file to check if the line is an import. However, the function `is_import` is called incorrectly as `current_line.is_import` which is not the correct way to invoke the function.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is trying to assert the equality of the expected and actual formatted code.
4. The error message indicates that the test is failing because of differences in the number of empty lines inserted, which is likely caused by the incorrect identification of import statements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly calling `current_line.is_import` to check if a line is an import statement, instead of calling the `is_import` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Correctly call the `is_import` function to determine if a line is an import statement.
- Ensure that the condition for checking import statements in `_maybe_empty_lines` uses the correct function call.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Correct function call to check import statement
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Correct function call to check import statement
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
