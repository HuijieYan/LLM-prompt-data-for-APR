### 1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert between two lines of code based on certain conditions.
- The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output of `fs(source)`.
- The error message indicates that there is an extra empty line being inserted between the lines, causing the assertion to fail.

### 2. Error Location:
- The bug seems to be related to how the function determines the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions.
- Specifically, there might be an issue in the logic that calculates the number of empty lines to insert in certain scenarios.

### 3. Cause of the Bug:
- The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely causing an incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines to insert between two lines of code.
- This incorrect calculation is leading to an extra empty line being inserted in between lines, causing the failure in the `test_comment_in_decorator`.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to review the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that determines the number of empty lines to insert.
- Check the conditions and calculations inside the function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being returned based on the scenario described.
- Adjust the logic accordingly to prevent the insertion of extra empty lines between lines of code.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call the is_import function
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Call the is_import function
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, modifications have been made to improve the logic that calculates the number of empty lines to insert between lines of code. Additionally, the function `is_import` is called to correctly determine if the previous and current lines are imports. This adjusted logic should prevent the insertion of extra empty lines and address the issue causing the failing test.
