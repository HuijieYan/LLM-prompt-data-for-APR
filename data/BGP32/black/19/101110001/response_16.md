### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling cases where empty lines need to be inserted or not based on different conditions of the input `current_line`. One of the conditions contains a check `self.previous_line.is_import`, which is trying to call the `is_import` method on `self.previous_line` object. However, the `is_import` method is defined outside the scope of this class and is not directly accessible. This leads to the error in the failing test function where it encounters a mismatch due to the incorrect implementation.

### Bug
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is caused by attempting to access `is_import` as a property of `self.previous_line`, which is not defined. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`. 

### Fix
To fix this bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should check the type of `self.previous_line` and call the `is_import` method defined in the same file (`black.py`) instead of trying to access it as an attribute of `self.previous_line`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines before an import line.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function includes the call to the `is_import` method directly, which fixes the bug related to the AttributeError. Now the function should properly handle the different conditions for inserting empty lines according to the requirements.
