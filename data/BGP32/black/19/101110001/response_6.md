### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` test failed due to a discrepancy between the expected and actual output. The test involves comparing the formatted source code (`actual`) with the expected formatted code (`expected`).

### Bugs in the Buggy Function:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is referenced `self.previous_line.is_import` which should be `self.previous_line` should be checked with the `is_import` function from the imported module.
2. The logic for handling newlines and prefixes is convoluted and needs to be simplified.
3. There are inconsistencies in handling line depths and decorators which might cause incorrect newline adjustments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of newlines and prefixes within the function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The function incorrectly checks if the `previous_line` is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of referencing the `is_import` function. This results in incorrect newline adjustments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `is_import` function is properly utilized to check if a line is an import.
2. Simplify the logic for handling newlines and prefixes to avoid confusion and potential errors.
3. Correctly handle cases of line depths, decorators, flow control, and imports to ensure accurate adjustments of newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the function should now properly handle newline adjustments based on the previous line's properties and eliminate the bug that caused the test to fail.
