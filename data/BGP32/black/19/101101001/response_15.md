### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrect handling of line breaks when determining whether to add empty lines in the formatted output. The function logic is supposed to handle various scenarios like decorators, imports, yield statements, etc., but due to some incorrect conditions and assignments, the function fails to produce the expected output.

1. In Case 1, when dealing with a decorator (`current_line.is_decorator == True`), the function returns `(2, 0)` immediately, which is expected because decorators require two empty lines. However, in this case, the function should not consume `before` empty lines because it's a decorator.
  
2. In Case 2, the function fails to account for already existing comments in the line, resulting in an incorrect output.

3. In Case 3 and Case 4, the function doesn't handle the scenario when the previous line is an import, and the current line is not an import causing an incorrect output.

4. In Case 5, the function fails to handle the scenario when the previous line was a yield statement, but the current line is not a yield statement, leading to an incorrect output.

5. In Case 6, similar to Case 1, when handling decorators, the function should not insert empty lines, but it incorrectly adds two empty lines in this case.

6. In Case 7, the function correctly handles adding an empty line after a function definition (`is_def == True`), but it misses storing the current depth in the `previous_defs` list, causing an incorrect output.

7. In Case 8, the function should handle the indentation level (`depth`) properly to determine the number of empty lines needed. In this case, it incorrectly adds only one empty line instead of two.

### Bug Fix
To fix the buggy function, we need to adjust the logic for handling decorators, imports, yield statements, and function definitions correctly. Additionally, handling comments and preserving the proper indentation level is essential.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if depth != 0:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2

        if is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the identified issues and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the failing test cases.
