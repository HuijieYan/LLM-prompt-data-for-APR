### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is mainly due to the incorrect condition checks and handling of empty lines. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before the current line based on various conditions.

1. In Case 1, when `current_line` is a decorator, the function should not insert empty lines before the first line in the file. However, it mistakenly returns `(0, 0)` which might cause an extra empty line in this case.

2. In Case 2 and Case 3, the previous line is not validated correctly. The function is supposed to skip inserting empty lines between decorators. However, in these cases, it incorrectly returns `(0, 0)` where an empty line should not be inserted according to the logic.

3. In Case 4 and Case 5, the check for imports is incorrect. It should insert an empty line before a non-import line if the previous line was an import at the same depth. However, this condition is not properly handled leading to an incorrect number of empty lines added.

4. In Case 6, the handling of yielding lines is incorrect. The function should insert an empty line after a non-yield line if the previous line was a yield at a different depth. But due to a flawed logic, it deviates from the expected behavior.

5. In Case 7, the function fails to handle the scenario where a new definition line begins. It should add an empty line at the start of a new definition, but the implementation is faulty, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, focus on correcting the conditions that determine the insertion of empty lines. Ensure that the function accurately determines the number of empty lines needed in each scenario based on the defined rules. Address the issues mentioned in the bug explanation to align the function's behavior with the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import \
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield \
            and depth != self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_def:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return 2, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By incorporating these fixes into the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, you can address the identified issues and ensure that the function behaves correctly according to the specified conditions.
