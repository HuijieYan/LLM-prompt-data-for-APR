### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not handling the conditions related to imports (`is_import` function) correctly. The buggy function checks if the `current_line` is an import statement based on the `self.previous_line.is_import` condition, which is incorrect. Instead, it should use the `is_import` function to determine whether the current line is an import statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the condition in the buggy function that checks for imports to use the `is_import` function.
2. Make sure to handle the `before` variable correctly based on the conditions related to imports in the function.
3. Ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the import conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_import(current_line):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the function to use the `is_import` function correctly, the buggy behavior related to imports should be fixed, and the failing tests should now pass.
