### Issue:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has issues with the logic that determines the number of empty lines to insert before a current line. The conditions for inserting empty lines are not working correctly based on the input parameters and previous line information.

1. In Case 2, the function should not insert empty lines before the `'# TODO: X'` line because the previous line is a comment line. However, the function incorrectly inserts 2 empty lines.

2. In Case 5, the function should insert 1 empty line before the `'# TODO: Z'` line because it is not a decorator, def, class, import, or yield statement. However, the function incorrectly inserts 0 empty lines.

### Fix:
The conditions for inserting empty lines should be revised to ensure correct behavior based on the previous line context and the current line properties.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on the conditions provided.

After applying this fix, re-running the failing test cases should result in the correct behavior and pass the tests.
