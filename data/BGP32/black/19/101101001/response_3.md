### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the condition checks involving the `is_import` attribute of `current_line` and `previous_line`. 

1. The function is using `self.previous_line.is_import` to check if the previous line is an import statement, but it is not calling the `is_import` function with the leaf to check if it's an import. This results in the `is_import` function not being utilized, and incorrect checks for import lines in the function.

2. In the condition where it checks for `self.previous_line.is_import` and `not current_line.is_import`, it is trying to compare a method call to a boolean value which causes issues.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` function is called properly to check if a line is an import statement. Additionally, we need to modify the condition related to import statements to properly compare the results from the `is_import` function. 

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_current_line_import = is_import(current_line)
    is_previous_line_import = self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line)

    if is_previous_line_import and not is_current_line_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line 
        and self.previous_line.is_yield 
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these fixes, the function will now properly check for import lines using the `is_import` function and correctly compare the results as intended. This should address the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected when called from the test scenarios.
