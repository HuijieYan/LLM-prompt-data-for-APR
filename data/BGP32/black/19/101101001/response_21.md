The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function is related to the checks for previous lines. The function is designed to handle specific cases with different numbers of empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous line. However, in some scenarios, the checks for previous line properties are incorrect.

The issue arises when determining whether to insert empty lines based on the previous line being an import or a yield statement. The bug stems from the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`, which is supposed to check if the previous line is an import statement by calling the `is_import()` function. However, the function call is missing parentheses, resulting in an attempt to access the `is_import` attribute directly on the `previous_line`, which leads to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `self.previous_line.is_import` condition should be corrected to call the `is_import()` function with the `previous_line` as an argument to properly check if the previous line is an import. Additionally, the condition that checks for a previous line being a yield statement also requires proper handling.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes the proper function call for checking if the previous line is an import statement and handles the condition for yield statements appropriately. After applying this fix, the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function should pass the failing tests.
