The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditions that check for `is_import`, `is_yield`, and the assignment of `newlines`.

### Issue:
1. The function attempts to access `self.previous_line.is_import` which should be checked using the `is_import` function from the imported file but is incorrectly accessed directly. This leads to an AttributeError since a Line object doesn't have an `is_import` attribute.
   
2. The check for `is_yield` condition is also incorrect as `current_line.is_yield` is not in line with the logic to handle it properly.

3. The assignment of `newlines` is incorrect as it doesn't consider all the necessary conditions.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Use the `is_import` function to check if the current line is an import statement.
2. Revise the condition checks for `is_yield` to ensure correct handling.
3. Update the logic to calculate `newlines` based on the conditions provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# This function should be present in black.py
def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Implementation to check if the leaf represents an import statement
    return True if leaf.type == "import" else False

# This is the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the conditions correctly and pass the failing test provided.
