### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditional check for `self.previous_line.is_import`. The function is trying to access the attribute `is_import` on the `previous_line` object, assuming it would be a boolean value that indicates whether the line is an import. However, the `is_import` function is defined separately to determine if a leaf is an import, not a line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly call the `is_import` function passing the appropriate leaf as an argument. This will correctly determine if the current line is an import based on the leaves in the line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    ...
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line.leaves[0]) # change condition to use the is_import function
        and not is_import(current_line.leaves[0])
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    ...
```

By updating the conditional check as shown above, we address the bug in the function and ensure that the correct logic is applied to determine if the current line is an import based on the leaves.
