### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the conditional check `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` which is causing the failing test cases. The issue is that the code is attempting to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line`, assuming it is a function or method like `is_decorator`. However, `is_import` is a separate function defined in the same file, not an attribute of `Line` objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function on `self.previous_line` to correctly determine if the previous line is an import or not. We also need to update the logic accordingly based on the correct evaluation of whether the previous line is an import.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Fix: Call the is_import function here
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the code to call the `is_import` function correctly, we ensure that the check for the previous line being an import is accurate, fixing the bug.
