### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the conditions for inserting empty lines based on certain criteria such as whether the current line is a decorator, defining a function or class, flow control, import statement, or yield statement. The function's logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in different scenarios is incorrect, leading to incorrect output in certain cases.

### Bug Location
1. The condition for `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:` is causing incorrect behavior by not correctly handling the scenario of inserting empty lines between decorators.
2. The condition for `if current_line.is_import` is not correctly identifying if the current line is an import statement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the condition for handling empty lines between decorators to ensure that empty lines are correctly inserted.
2. Fix the condition to accurately identify import statements.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line) # updated condition to check if the previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import # updated condition to check if the current line is not an import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By updating the conditions as mentioned above, the function should now correctly handle the scenarios and pass the failing test cases.
