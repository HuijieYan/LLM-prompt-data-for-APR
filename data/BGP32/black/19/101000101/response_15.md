The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` lies in the logic used to calculate the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The bug is mainly related to the comparison and updating of `before` variable. The issue arises when updating `before` based on certain conditions leading to unexpected behavior.

The main cause of the bug is the improper handling of the `before` variable. In the buggy function, `before` is calculated and updated in different parts of the function without proper consideration of existing data. This can result in incorrect values for `before` and consequently lead to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on different conditions. We should maintain the previously calculated `before` value if certain conditions are met and only update it when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This fixed version of the function ensures that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions specified in each block of the function. It accommodates the expected input/output values provided for different test cases.
