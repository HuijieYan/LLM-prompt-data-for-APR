Based on the buggy function and the expected input/output values, here is an analysis of the issue:

1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle different scenarios regarding empty lines in a code file. It sets the maximum number of allowed empty lines based on the `depth` of the current line and certain flags set in the `current_line` object.

2. The bug arises from incorrectly checking for the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line`. The function mistakenly uses `self.previous_line.is_import`, which may lead to an AttributeError since the `previous_line` object does not have an `is_import` attribute.

3. It seems that the incorrect attribute access `self.previous_line.is_import` is likely to throw an AttributeError due to the absence of the `is_import` attribute.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we properly check if the `previous_line` is an import line. We can achieve this by calling the `is_import` function (defined in the same file) on the `previous_line` object.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This correction ensures that we correctly check for an import line in `self.previous_line` by calling the `is_import` function. Let me know if you need more information or assistance.
