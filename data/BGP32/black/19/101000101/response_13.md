The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` is related to the handling of the `is_import` property. The function attempts to check `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming the property exists in the `Line` object, but in reality, the property is defined in the `is_import` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly call the `is_import` function to check if the current line or the previous line is an import. Additionally, we need to update the function to consider the boolean return value of the `is_import` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        if not is_import(current_line) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly calls the `is_import` function to check for import statements in both the current and previous lines, ensuring the correct handling of the import check. This fix addresses the bug and satisfies all the expected input/output values for the function.
