### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. It considers various conditions such as decorators, functions, imports, flow control statements, etc., to make the decision.

There are a few issues in the buggy function:
1. It checks `self.previous_line.is_import`, but `is_import` is a function and not an attribute of `Line`.
2. The condition for `is_flow_control` only updates the before value and not the depth.
3. It doesn't return values properly where necessary, leading to incorrect decisions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition involving `is_import` to call the `is_import` function correctly.
2. Update the condition for `is_flow_control` to correctly handle both before and depth values.
3. Ensure that all return statements are providing the correct values as per the conditions.

### Bug-fixed function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This bug-fixed version of the function should now correctly handle the different conditions as described and pass all the expected test cases.
