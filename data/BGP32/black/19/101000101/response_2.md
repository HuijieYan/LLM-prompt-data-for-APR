### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for managing the number of empty lines to be inserted before each line in the code based on certain conditions. The cases provided specify the expected values and types of variables at different scenarios. 

### Bug
The bug in the function lies in the improper handling of the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`. Since `self.previous_line` is a `Line` object, the check `self.previous_line.is_import` will raise an AttributeError because there is no `is_import` attribute defined within the `Line` class. The intention here was to check if the current line is an import, but it is not being done correctly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition checking to match the correct logic related to imports.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and getattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import', False)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The fix involves using `getattr()` method to check if the `is_import` attribute exists in `self.previous_line` and fallback to `False` if it doesn't without raising an AttributeError. This modification ensures that the intended logic for handling imports is correctly implemented in the function.
