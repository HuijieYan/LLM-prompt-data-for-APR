The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug in the logic where it determines the number of empty lines to be inserted based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to handling the `self.previous_line.is_import` check.

The bug occurs when the function is trying to determine whether to insert empty lines based on the previous line being an import statement and the current line not being an import statement. This check is faulty because `self.previous_line.is_import` is not being set correctly from the `is_import` function.

To fix this bug:
- Update the `is_import` function to set the `is_import` attribute for the line correctly.
- Modify the checks in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function related to `self.previous_line.is_import` to refer to the `is_import` attribute instead.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version should now correctly handle the case where the previous line is an import statement, allowing the function to properly insert empty lines according to the specified conditions.
