The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues. Let's break down the problems and suggest a strategy to fix them:

### Issues:
1. In the if condition checking `self.previous_line.is_import`, the function is incorrectly referencing `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line`, but it should be using the `is_import` function defined in the same file.
2. The initial value of `before` is set to 1 whenever `depth` is non-zero, which is not the intended behavior based on the expected cases.
3. The logic for updating the `before` value in the loop is incorrect, leading to potential bugs in determining the number of newlines to return.

### Strategy:
1. Correct the reference to the `is_import` function.
2. Update the logic that modifies the `before` value to align with the expected behavior provided in the test cases.
3. Ensure that the loop correctly updates the `before` value based on the depth comparison.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = len(first_leaf.prefix.split('\n')) if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_prev_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
    
    if is_prev_line_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues and align with the expected input-output values provided in the test cases.
