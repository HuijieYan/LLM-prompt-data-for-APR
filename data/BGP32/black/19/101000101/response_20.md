### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` on line 59. The intention of this condition appears to be to check if the previous line is an import statement. However, instead of checking using a function call `self.previous_line.is_import()`, it directly accesses the attribute `is_import`, which is not a part of the Line class.

Since the `is_import` function (a related function) checks if the input Leaf contains an import statement, it seems that the intention was to use it to determine if a line is an import. Based on the provided expected input/output values, it is clear that the code intended to call the `is_import` function to check for imports instead of directly accessing an attribute.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the faulty condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the `is_import` function (`is_import(self.previous_line)`). By using the correct function call, we can properly check if the previous line is an import statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the bug is fixed by replacing `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to properly check if the previous line is an import statement. Now the function should work as intended and satisfy the expected input/output values for all cases.
