The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has an issue where it incorrectly handles the condition for checking if the `previous_line` is an import. This causes unexpected behavior when determining the number of empty lines to return.

The bug occurs when checking:
```python
self.previous_line.is_import
```
This condition does not work as intended because the `is_import` function is a separate function and is not invoked through the `previous_line`. Instead, the `is_import` function should be called directly with the `previous_line` passed as an argument.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition block as follows:

```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and is_import(self.previous_line)
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
    return (before or 1), 0
```

This revised condition calls the `is_import` function correctly with `self.previous_line` as an argument. Ensure that the `is_import` function correctly identifies if the line is an import statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing this condition, the corrected function should now correctly handle the cases provided and return the expected values.
