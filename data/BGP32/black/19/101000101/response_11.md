The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed to fix the bugs in the provided code. 

1. The function expects an instance of the class `Line` as the parameter `current_line`.

2. The function uses attributes of the `current_line` instance, such as `depth`, `leaves`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to determine the behavior and return values.

3. The function maintains state information in `self` attributes like `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`.

4. The function is designed to handle different conditions based on the attributes of `current_line` and the previous line, if available.

5. The function seems to have issues with correctly updating the state of the program based on the input parameters provided.

To correct the bugs in the function, we can follow a strategy to identify and address the issues:

1. Ensure that the conditionals are correctly checking and updating the state variables based on the attributes of the `current_line`.

2. Fix any issues related to the ordering of conditionals and apply appropriate logic to handle each conditional case effectively.

3. Make sure that the state variables, such as `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`, are updated correctly during the function execution.

4. Address any inconsistencies in the return values based on the expected behavior for each input case.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By carefully addressing the issues and following the outlined suggestions, the corrected version of the function should now behave as expected for the provided input cases.
