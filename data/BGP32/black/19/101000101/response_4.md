### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The function checks various conditions based on the current line's properties and the previous line. The bug arises from the condition where it tries to access `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line`, which should be invoked using the imported function `is_import(leaf)`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the buggy function tries to access the `is_import` property directly on `self.previous_line` without calling the `is_import` function. This leads to an AttributeError because `is_import` is not a property of the `Line` class. The code should use the `is_import` function from the same file instead.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to use the imported `is_import` function to check the `is_import` property of the `self.previous_line`. This will ensure that the function call is correct and prevent any AttributeError from occurring.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

Now, the bug is fixed by using the `is_import` function correctly, and the corrected version should satisfy the expected input/output values for all provided test cases.
