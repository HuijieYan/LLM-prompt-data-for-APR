The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed to ensure it functions correctly based on the expected input/output values provided. The identified problems are as follows:

1. There is a reference to `current_line.is_import`, but the function `is_import` is not being called correctly.
2. The conditions involving `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` are not handled as expected according to the given test cases.
3. The check related to `self.previous_defs` behavior needs modification.

To fix these issues, we need to address the following:

1. Include the call to the `is_import` function correctly.
2. Adjust the conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` as per the expectations.
3. Modify the logic involving `self.previous_defs` to ensure it updates correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function based on the identified issues and the expected input/output values provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_import = is_import(current_line)  # Correct call to is_import function

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the corrections outlined above, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output values provided in the test cases.
