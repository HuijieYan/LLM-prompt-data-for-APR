The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that it is trying to access attributes like `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` directly on the `current_line` object, but these attributes are not defined on the `Line` class itself. Instead, there are separate functions like `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` available within the module to perform those checks.

To fix this bug, we need to call the corresponding functions (`is_import`, `is_yield`, `is_decorator`) to determine the values of `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `current_line.is_decorator`, respectively, before using them in conditional statements.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = is_decorator(current_line)
    is_import_line = is_import(current_line)
    is_yield_line = is_yield(current_line)

    if is_decorator or (is_def(current_line) or is_class(current_line)):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_decorator(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import_line(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import_line(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield_line(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield_line(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we're utilizing functions like `is_import`, `is_decorator`, `is_yield`, `is_def`, and `is_class` to determine the boolean values required for conditional checks in the function. This approach ensures that the correct attributes are accessed and evaluated properly, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
