The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic that determines when to return the number of empty lines before and after the current line. The function is not handling the case where the current line is a decorator properly, causing issues with the formatting.

Explanation of the bug:
1. When `current_line` is a decorator, the function should not insert empty lines before or after it.
2. If the `current_line` is a decorator and the `previous_line` is also a decorator, empty lines should not be inserted between them.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the cases where `current_line` is a decorator.
2. Ensuring that empty lines are not inserted before or after a decorator.
3. Check if the `previous_line` is a decorator to avoid inserting empty lines between decorators.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic to handle decorators correctly, the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
