## Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines()` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The function checks various conditions based on the current line's attributes (depth, leaves, is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, and is_yield) and the attributes of the previous line.

## Identified Issues:
1. The logic for adjusting the number of empty lines based on certain conditions seems to be incorrect in some cases.
2. The handling of `before` variable and adjusting it based on `max_allowed` and the depth of the current line is causing issues.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function arises from the incorrect logic used to calculate and handle the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. In some cases, the logic for adjusting the `before` variable based on `max_allowed` and depth is causing unexpected outcomes.

## Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Review and correct the logic for adjusting the `before` variable based on different conditions.
2. Ensure that the number of empty lines returned by the function aligns with the expected behavior for different types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc.).
3. Address any inconsistencies in handling the `before` variable and ensure it is correctly updated based on the conditions.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By addressing the issues in the logic and aligning the adjustments to the `before` variable with the expected behavior in different scenarios, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function should now pass the failing test provided.
