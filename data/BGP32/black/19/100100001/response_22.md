The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a logic issue in determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line. The problem arises when trying to handle cases involving decorators, definitions, classes, flow control, imports, and yields.

The bug is evident in the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`, which is likely failing due to incorrect handling of decorators and newlines.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert based on the specific conditions in each case (decorators, definitions, classes, etc.). 

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    newlines = 1
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        newlines = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth) if not current_line.is_decorator else None
    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and \
            not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    elif self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and \
            (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
    before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), 1)
    first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
    return before, newlines
```

This corrected version should address the issues with handling decorators and correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the conditions of the current line.
