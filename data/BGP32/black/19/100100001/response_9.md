## Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line based on various conditions like depth, decorators, flow control, imports, etc. 

## Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to handle the case where `before` needs to be updated within the while loop, which results in incorrect maintenance of the `before` value based on the depth condition.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value is correctly updated within the while loop and that the conditions for updating it are correctly checked and handled.

## Corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if depth:
        before = 1
    else:
        before = 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the `before` value is appropriately updated within the while loop based on the depth condition, preventing the bug from causing incorrect behavior.
