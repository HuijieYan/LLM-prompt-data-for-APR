The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is likely related to the logic for handling empty lines when encountering decorators in the code. When a comment is present within a decorator, the function fails to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic specifically for decorators to ensure that comments within decorators are handled properly. Additionally, we need to consider the presence of comments in relation to the insertion of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            if len(self.previous_line.leaves) == 1 and self.previous_line.leaves[0].type == Token.COMMENT:
                return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version includes a check to account for comments within decorators, ensuring that no empty lines are inserted when this specific scenario occurs. It addresses the bug identified in the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
