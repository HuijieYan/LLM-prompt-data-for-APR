## Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line being processed.
2. The function considers various conditions such as depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to determine the number of empty lines.
3. The bug could lie in the logic that handles the calculation of empty lines based on different line attributes like depth, decorators, etc.
4. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` expects the output of the function to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines when there is a comment in a decorator.

## Bug:
The bug likely occurs in the logic that handles decorators in `_maybe_empty_lines`. When there is a comment in a decorator, the function does not handle the empty lines calculation correctly, leading to failure in the test `test_comment_in_decorator`.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for decorators to correctly determine the number of empty lines required when a comment is present. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments in decorators are being handled properly while calculating the number of empty lines before the current line.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if '#@' in current_line.prefix:  # Adjust for comment in a decorator
            return 1, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0

``` 

By adding the condition `if '#@' in current_line.prefix:` to handle comments in decorators, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines when there is a comment in a decorator, fixing the bug identified by the failing test scenario.
