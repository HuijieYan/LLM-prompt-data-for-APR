## Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line in the code. The function considers various conditions such as depth, leaves, decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc., to calculate the number of empty lines.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling the `current_line.depth`. In some cases, the calculation of `before` and `newlines` does not consider the full context of the current line, resulting in incorrect empty line counts.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling the depth of the current line and ensure that the appropriate number of empty lines is returned based on the specific conditions.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic related to `newlines`, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the conditions specified in the function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
