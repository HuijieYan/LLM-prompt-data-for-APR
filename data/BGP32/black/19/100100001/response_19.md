The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling empty lines before certain types of lines like decorators, def, and class lines. The issue stems from incorrectly calculating the number of newlines to insert based on the conditions provided.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining when to insert empty lines in the function based on different line types and context.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version:
- The logic for handling empty lines before def and class lines has been revised to insert the correct number of newlines.
- Proper handling for decorators has been added to track previous depth values.
- The conditions for empty lines before import and yield lines have been adjusted to work as intended.
- Return statements have been modified to provide the correct number of newlines and space flags.

With these adjustments, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test provided.
