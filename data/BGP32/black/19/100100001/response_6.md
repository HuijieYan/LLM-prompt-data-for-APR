The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic related to determining when to insert empty lines in the code formatting process. Specifically, the conditions for when to insert empty lines before certain code constructs are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves analyzing each conditional statement and ensuring that the correct empty line count is returned based on the context of the current line and the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if current_line.is_import:
            return 0, 0
        elif depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the conditions for when to insert empty lines based on the context of the current and previous lines, the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` as provided.
