The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before or after a specific line. The bug causes incorrect insertion of empty lines in certain cases, leading to a failure in the test `test_comment_in_decorator`.

The bug occurs when determining the number of newlines to insert before or after a line based on certain conditions. The logic seems to be overly complex and buggy, leading to wrong decisions on inserting empty lines. 

To fix this bug, we need to simplify the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before or after a line. We should carefully evaluate the conditions and revise the logic based on the requirements of empty lines insertion in the code.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before or after a line, ensuring that the conditions are met accurately. The revised logic should now pass the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
