The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle various cases related to adding empty lines in a Python file based on specific conditions. However, there are some issues in the implementation that lead to failing the provided test. Let's go through the identified cases:

1. In the first case, where `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`, the function should set `max_allowed` to 2. However, in the current implementation, even if `is_decorator` is `True`, it sets `max_allowed` to 1. This issue affects the correct handling of empty lines.

2. In the second case, when `current_line.is_decorator` is `False` and `previous_line` is not `None`, the function should check specific conditions to determine the number of newlines to add. The current implementation does not properly handle these conditions, resulting in incorrect newline count.

To resolve these issues and ensure the function behaves as expected in all cases, the following corrections can be applied in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max_allowed, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max_allowed, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max_allowed, 0

    return max_allowed, 0
```

These corrections address the identified issues within the function, ensuring that the correct conditions are checked and the appropriate number of empty lines are added based on the input parameters and previous line context.
