The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic related to `before` variable assignment and handling of `depth` conditions. The function is not correctly updating the `before` variable in some conditions, leading to incorrect output.

The buggy function's issue can be summarized as follows:
- The `before` variable is not consistently updated in various code paths, leading to incorrect values.
- The logic around handling `depth` conditions is not properly implemented, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on the conditions mentioned in the function. Also, the handling of `depth` conditions needs to be adjusted to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to the incorrect handling of the `before` variable and the `depth` conditions, ensuring that the function now behaves as expected across different scenarios.
