The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has some issues that need to be addressed to pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values. Here is the analysis and corrected version of the function:

### Issues with the Buggy Function:
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` based on the depth of the `current_line`.
2. Incorrect handling of `before` value inside the loop.
3. Error in determining the number of newlines to return in certain conditions.
4. Mistake in updating the `self.previous_defs` list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bugs:
1. Ensure that `max_allowed` is correctly set based on the depth of the `current_line`.
2. Update the `before` value properly inside the loop based on different conditions.
3. Fix the logic for calculating the number of newlines to return in specific scenarios.
4. Correctly update the `self.previous_defs` list when necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the identified issues in the buggy function and using the corrected version provided above, the function should now pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values outlined for each case.
