## Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle different scenarios based on the attributes of the `current_line` object and the previous lines processed. The main bug that needs fixing is related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue arises from how the `before` variable is handled during the processing of previous definitions. If the depth of the current line is 0, the `before` variable should be set to 2 initially and then decremented based on the condition. However, in some cases, this variable is being set to 1 unconditionally, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is handled correctly and decremented only when necessary. We should follow the logic based on different conditions to determine the appropriate value for the `before` variable.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By properly handling the `before` variable during the loop that processes previous definitions, we ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before the current line based on the given conditions.
