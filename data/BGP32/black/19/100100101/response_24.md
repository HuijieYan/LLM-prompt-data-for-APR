### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when attempting to set the `before` variable based on the depth value of the current line. The issue arises when trying to update `before` within the loop to handle a specific condition but using incorrect logic that results in incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly within the loop to handle the specific conditions as intended. We need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the conditions and update the `before` variable accordingly based on the depth value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic within the while loop to correctly update the `before` variable based on the depth value, the corrected version of the function should now handle the conditions properly and pass the failing test cases.
