After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can observe that the bug lies in the logic for handling previous definitions. The function is not correctly updating the `before` variable based on the conditions related to `depth` and `is_decorator`. This results in incorrect output values for certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the `before` variable within the function. We should consider the `depth`, `is_decorator`, and conditions involving `previous_line` appropriately to ensure the correct number of empty lines is returned.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth != 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth != 0:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the `before` variable correctly based on the conditions, the corrected function is now expected to pass the failing test cases and provide the desired output values for all scenarios.
