### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the calculation of the `before` variable for different scenarios. The issue occurs when updating the value of `before` inside the while loop that checks `self.previous_defs`. The logic within the loop causes incorrect manipulation of the `before` variable, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug:
1. Adjust the calculation of the `before` variable inside the while loop to ensure it behaves as expected.
2. Make sure that the logic to update `before` based on the depth and condition is properly handled to align with the intended behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic inside the while loop to correctly set the `before` value based on depth, the corrected function should now handle the scenarios as expected and pass the failing test cases.
