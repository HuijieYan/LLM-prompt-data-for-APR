The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the logic for handling empty lines before certain types of lines such as decorators, definitions, imports, flow controls, and yields. The function is not correctly updating the `before` and `newlines` variables based on the conditions provided.

The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of `before` and `newlines` variables depending on the conditions. The function fails to accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert before different types of lines, leading to incorrect spacing in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert based on the input `current_line` and the previous line. We should also ensure that the `before` and `newlines` variables are updated appropriately for each condition.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now handle the empty line insertion logic correctly based on different conditions and should pass the failing test cases.
