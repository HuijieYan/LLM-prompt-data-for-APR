The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple issues that need to be addressed:

1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` variable.
2. Incorrect usage of the `depth` variable.
3. Incorrect updating of the `before` variable.
4. Incorrect logic for determining the number of newlines to return.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function does not properly handle the conditions for returning the number of empty lines. There are inconsistencies in handling the `max_allowed` variable and updating the `before` variable based on conditions. Additionally, the logic for determining the number of newlines to return is flawed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the correct value for `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of the current line.
2. Update the `before` variable accordingly without overwriting it in the loop.
3. Adjust the logic for returning the number of newlines based on different conditions.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2 if current_line.depth == 0 else 1
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and properly handle the conditions for returning the correct number of empty lines based on the input parameters and conditions.
