The potential error in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the assignment of the `max_allowed` variable. It is set to `2` unconditionally at first and then conditionally to `1` only if `current_line.depth == 0`. This leads to incorrect calculations further in the function. To fix this bug, `max_allowed` should be set correctly for all cases.

A strategy to fix the bug would be to set `max_allowed` to `2` initially. Then, update it to `1` if the conditions related to depth and decorators are met.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed based on the conditions provided.
