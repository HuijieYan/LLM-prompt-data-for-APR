The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines in certain conditions. The function determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. 

Upon analyzing the function and the failing test, it appears that the issue might arise when processing decorators with comments. Depending on the presence of comments within decorators, the function may not handle the insertion of empty lines correctly.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve ensuring that the function correctly tracks the presence of comments within decorators and adjusts the insertion of empty lines accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    # Check if the current line has comments and is a decorator
    if current_line.leaves and current_line.is_decorator:
        comments_present = any(leaf.comment for leaf in current_line.leaves)
        if comments_present:
            return 0, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adding a check to handle comments within decorators appropriately, this corrected version should resolve the issue identified in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
