The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `depth` variable when determining the number of empty lines to insert. The function does not correctly consider the conditions related to the depth of the current line and the previous line, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to the depth comparison and the conditions for inserting empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the logic related to `depth` comparisons and inserts the correct number of empty lines based on the conditions identified in the test cases.

With this fix, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
