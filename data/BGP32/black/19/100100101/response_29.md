The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the handling of empty lines before certain types of code blocks. In particular, the logic for inserting empty lines before decorators, functions, classes, and control flow statements is incorrect and leads to unexpected behavior.

The bug arises when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line of code. The function fails to correctly account for the situations where empty lines should be inserted. This results in incorrect line spacing in the formatted code.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for inserting empty lines based on the specific conditions defined in the function. Additionally, we should ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned for each case to align with the expected output.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class or self.previous_line.is_flow_control:
            newlines = 2 - current_line.depth if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0
            
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before decorators, functions, classes, and control flow statements, as well as import and yield statements, aligning with the expected output for the provided test cases.
