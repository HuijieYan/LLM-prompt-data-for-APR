After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, I have identified a potential bug in the function related to the handling of empty lines and indentation depth. The issue arises when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line based on certain conditions.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect assignment of `before` within the while loop that pops values from `self.previous_defs`. The assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` should be outside the while loop to ensure it is set correctly before modifying it in the loop.

To fix the bug, we need to move the assignment of `before` outside the while loop. Additionally, we should update the condition `if depth` to `if before` to handle the case properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2 if before == 0 else before
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the described changes, the corrected function should now handle the case properly and pass the failing test scenarios with the expected input and output values.
