The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has issues with correctly handling empty lines and line spacing based on certain conditions. The main problem lies in how the `max_allowed` value is being updated and used in the subsequent logic. The function fails to set the appropriate number of empty lines based on specific cases.

To address the bug, we need to update the logic that determines the number of empty lines (`newlines` and `before`) based on the conditions provided. We also need to ensure that the `max_allowed` value is properly set and utilized throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the number of empty lines and spacing based on the given conditions and pass the failing test cases provided.
