### Fixing the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

#### Bugs identified:
1. In the case where `current_line.is_decorator` or `current_line.is_def` or `current_line.is_class` are True, the logic to determine the number of newlines is not correctly implemented.
2. In some cases, the logic for determining the number of newlines based on previous lines is faulty.
3. The updates to `before` variable may not always reflect the correct number of newlines needed.
4. Inconsistent handling of depth levels for newlines.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revisit the conditional logic for determining the number of newlines required before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that the logic considers all relevant factors such as decorators, class definitions, flow control, imports, and yields.
3. Update the logic to handle depth levels properly and ensure accurate counting of newlines required.

#### Corrected Version of `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
            
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
            
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
        
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
        
    return before, 0
```

By applying these corrections, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should now accurately determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the provided test cases.
