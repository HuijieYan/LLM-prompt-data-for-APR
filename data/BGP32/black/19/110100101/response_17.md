### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for updating the `before` variable might be incorrect.
2. Handling of `self.previous_defs` list might be inappropriate, leading to incorrect output.
3. Conditions for checking `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield` might not be accurate.
4. The return statements at the end might not be returning the correct values.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug might be caused due to incorrect handling of the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. In particular, the logic for updating the `before` variable based on the `max_allowed` value and the conditions for checking various flags like `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield` might not be accurate. Additionally, the handling of the `self.previous_defs` list might not be correctly managing the depth of the previous definitions, which could lead to incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and update the logic for updating the `before` variable to ensure it aligns with the `max_allowed` value correctly.
2. Check and correct the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the flags like `is_decorator`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, `is_yield`.
3. Ensure proper management of the `self.previous_defs` list to accurately track the depth of previous definitions.
4. Verify the return statements at the end to ensure they are returning the correct values based on the conditions in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 - int(current_line.depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the identified issues and align the logic with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases.
