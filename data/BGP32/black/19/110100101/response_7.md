### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It involves various conditional checks based on the type of the current line and previous line.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation arises due to the handling of the `before` variable. In each iteration of the while loop, the `before` variable is updated with the value `1 if depth else 2`. This leads to potential incorrect modifications when adjusting the number of empty lines before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable retains its correct value during each iteration of the while loop. Additionally, we need to handle all branching conditions appropriately to determine the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Corrected Implementation

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line:
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above corrections and ensuring the correct handling of the `before` variable, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
