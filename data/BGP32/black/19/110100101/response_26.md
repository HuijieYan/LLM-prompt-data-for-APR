### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable when there is a condition to return early in the function. Specifically, when certain conditions are met, the function should return specific values for `newlines` and `0`, but it incorrectly assigns the value of `before` instead of returning `0` for `before`. This causes the function to return `before` instead of the intended value of `0`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct values are returned when the function specifies early return conditions. If the function should return `0` for `before`, it should explicitly return this value. We can achieve this by setting `before` to `0` in the respective early return conditions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making sure to return `0` explicitly in the relevant early return conditions, we ensure that the corrected function behaves as expected and passes the failing test cases.
