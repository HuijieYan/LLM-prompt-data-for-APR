### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions related to the input `current_line` and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object.

The potential errors in the function are:
1. Inconsistent handling of `max_allowed` based on the `depth` of `current_line`.
2. Incorrect manipulation of `before` variable that stores the count of newlines in `current_line`.
3. Incorrect handling of `self.previous_defs` list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the incorrect manipulation of `max_allowed` and `before` variables. In some cases, these variables are being overwritten, leading to incorrect results in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that `max_allowed` is correctly determined based on the depth of the `current_line` and only updated when necessary.
2. Use a separate variable to store the initial count of newlines in the `prefix` of `first_leaf` before modifying it.
3. Properly handle the maintenance of `self.previous_defs` list to ensure correct behavior.

### Bug-fixed version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # Initialize max_allowed based on current_line's depth
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    # Initialize before count based on first leaf's prefix
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        adjusted_before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = first_leaf.prefix.replace("\n", "", adjusted_before)
    else:
        before = 0
    
    # Maintain consistency in updating/using previous_defs list
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        adjusted_before = 1 if depth else 2

    # Check conditions and return appropriate values
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By fixing the issues mentioned above, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the expected output values for all the given test cases.
