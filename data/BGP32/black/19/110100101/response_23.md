### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the inconsistency in updating the `before` variable based on the depth of the current line. The function incorrectly updates the `before` variable as either 1 or 2 within the loop, even if the depth is 0. This inconsistency results in incorrect values being returned in some cases when determining the number of empty lines needed before the currently processed line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on the depth of the current line. We should only update `before` to 1 if the depth is non-zero and to 2 if the depth is zero. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the current line depth is 0 correctly to determine the correct number of empty lines needed before the line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
``` 

By updating the logic inside the while loop to correctly handle the `before` variable based on the current line's depth, we ensure that the function returns the correct number of empty lines needed. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected values for all the given cases.
