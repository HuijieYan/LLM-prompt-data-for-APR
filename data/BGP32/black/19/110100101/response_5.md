### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for handling `self.previous_defs`. The function is designed to track previous definitions in the code and handle empty lines accordingly. However, in some cases, the logic for updating `self.previous_defs` and determining the number of empty lines to insert seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Location:
1. The logic inside the `while` loop that updates `before` based on `self.previous_defs` seems incorrect.
2. The conditions for determining the number of empty lines to return after processing the current line might be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to properly handle the `self.previous_defs` list and updating it when necessary according to the current depth.
2. Review the conditions for determining the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line and update them if needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### After Correction:
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function now includes fixed logic to properly handle the updating of `self.previous_defs` and determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line based on the conditions provided in the code. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases provided.
