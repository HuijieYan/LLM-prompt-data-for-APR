### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are issues in the logic and variable handling that are causing it to fail the test cases.

### Issues
1. The variable `max_allowed` is being set to `2` if `current_line.depth == 0` but is never reset back to `1` if `current_line.depth != 0`. This may lead to incorrect `max_allowed` values in subsequent calculations.
2. The handling of `self.previous_defs` to track previous definitions is flawed. The condition `before = 1 if depth else 2` inside the while loop is incorrect and doesn't properly update the `before` value.
3. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines are not accurately capturing the intended logic, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Initialize `max_allowed` to `1` at the start of the function and reset it to `1` inside the if block where `current_line.depth != 0`.
2. Update the logic for handling `self.previous_defs` to properly update the `before` value based on the depth.
3. Improve the return condition logic to accurately capture the required number of empty lines based on different scenarios.

### Bug-fixed Function
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        else:
            max_allowed = 1
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By fixing the logic and variable handling within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and accurately calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after the input line.
