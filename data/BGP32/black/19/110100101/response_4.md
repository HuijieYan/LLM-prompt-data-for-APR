### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions related to the line type and context. However, there are a few issues in the logic of the function that are causing it to produce incorrect results.

1. The handling of `self.previous_defs` list is causing unexpected behavior in adjusting the number of empty lines.
2. The logic related to decorators and previous lines is not properly accounting for all scenarios leading to incorrect empty line calculations.

### Bug:
The issue seems to stem from the manipulation of the `before` variable and the updates based on the presence of specific line types and indentations. The function is not maintaining the correct count of empty lines before and after the current line consistently. 

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Properly handle the adjustment of `before` based on the presence of `self.previous_defs` and the type of the current line.
2. Refactor the logic related to decorators, imports, and other line types to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines.
3. Ensure the correct handling of previous line types to avoid unnecessary empty lines.

### Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            before = 1 if depth else 2
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified and ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function calculates the correct number of potential extra empty lines before and after the current line. Please integrate this corrected version into the `EmptyLineTracker` class to pass the failing test cases.
