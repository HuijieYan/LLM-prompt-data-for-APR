### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is intended to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It has several conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` object and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` object.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when managing the `previous_defs` list. In the while loop, the function tries to pop elements from the `previous_defs` list based on a condition related to the `depth` value. However, it doesn't properly update the `before` variable after popping elements from `previous_defs`. This can lead to incorrect empty line calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly after popping elements from the `previous_defs` list. We should set the `before` variable to 1 if the `depth` is not zero after popping elements. Additionally, we can simplify some of the conditions inside the function for better readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the `before` variable inside the while loop and simplifying some of the conditions, we have fixed the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected empty line calculations based on the input `current_line` and the `EmptyLineTracker` object's state.
