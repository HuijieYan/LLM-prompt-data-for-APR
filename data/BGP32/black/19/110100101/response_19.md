## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is meant to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The function does not correctly handle the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on various conditions such as depth, line types (decorator, def, class, flow control, import, yield), and the previous line's characteristics.

2. The use of `before` variable is inconsistent and may lead to incorrect values being returned.

3. The logic for managing `self.previous_defs` list and checking for previous lines in specific scenarios is flawed.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the issues mentioned above, we need to:
1. Correctly handle the conditions for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the input parameters and other internal state variables such as `self.previous_defs` and `self.previous_line`.

2. Fix the logic related to updating the `before` variable to ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned.

3. Refactor the logic related to managing `self.previous_defs` list and checking for previous lines to handle cases more accurately.

## Bug-fixed Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying these fixes, we ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function correctly calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line in accordance with the specified conditions and input parameters.
