### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is meant to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function contains several conditional statements based on the properties of the `current_line` object.
3. The bug occurs when trying to calculate the number of newlines before and after the current line.
4. The bug seems to stem from the handling of the `before` variable and the logic for determining the number of newlines to return.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly calculated based on the conditions specified in the function.

### Solution:
Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided. It addresses the issues related to the calculation of the `before` variable and the logic for determining the number of newlines to return in different scenarios.
