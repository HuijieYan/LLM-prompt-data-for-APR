### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is incorrectly calculating the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line. There are several issues in the function:
1. The logic for updating the `before` variable inside the while loop is incorrect and not consistent with the expected behavior.
2. The condition for `current_line.is_decorator` is not properly handling certain cases where the logic should be adjusted.
3. There are inconsistencies in returning values based on different conditions, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic inside the while loop to properly update the `before` value.
2. Modify the condition for `current_line.is_decorator` to better handle when to update `previous_defs` and fix the return logic accordingly.
3. Ensure consistency in returning values based on different conditions to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the necessary fixes outlined above, the corrected function should now properly calculate the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the currently processed line in accordance with the expected behavior for all test cases.
