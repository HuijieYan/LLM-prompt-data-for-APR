Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the processed line. The problem arises from the calculation of `before` variable and how the updating of `self.previous_defs` list is handled.

The function logic looks flawed in handling the `before` value when updating `self.previous_defs` list. The issue seems to be related to incorrectly handling the conditions and values for `before` based on `depth`.

To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic of how `before` value is updated and consider the conditions where it should or shouldn't be updated. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is correctly updated based on the `depth`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the `before` value correctly and adjusting how the `self.previous_defs` list is updated, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
