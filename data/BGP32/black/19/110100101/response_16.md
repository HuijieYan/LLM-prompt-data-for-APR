### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior and potential bugs:
1. The logic for handling `self.previous_defs` is flawed and can lead to incorrect results.
2. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines are not properly defined.
3. The function does not correctly handle all relevant cases based on the input parameters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the issues in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to:
1. Properly handle the `self.previous_defs` list to ensure it maintains the correct state based on the depth of the current line.
2. Refine the conditions for returning the number of empty lines before and after the line.
3. Consider all relevant cases based on the input parameters to ensure the correct output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    if depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1
        
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function handles the `self.previous_defs` correctly, refines the conditions for calculating empty lines, and considers all relevant cases based on the input parameters.
