### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions based on the properties of the `current_line` object and updates the variables accordingly. However, there are multiple issues in the function that prevent it from functioning correctly.

### Issues
1. The calculation of `before` variable is flawed when the `current_line` has leaves. The code tries to update `before` based on the number of newline characters in the prefix of the first leaf. However, it doesn't account for the case when `before` should be limited to `max_allowed`.
2. The handling of `previous_defs` list is incorrect. The function should pop elements from this list based on depth comparison but mistakenly assigns `1` or `2` to `before` instead of updating the `depth`.
3. There are missing return statements for certain conditions where the function should return specific values.

### Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the calculation of `before` to limit it to `max_allowed` when necessary.
2. Properly update `depth` and fix the logic around popping elements from `previous_defs`.
3. Add missing return statements for remaining conditions to ensure the function returns the correct values.

### Updated Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        depth = self.previous_defs[-1] if self.previous_defs else 0
        before = max(depth, 1) if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the suggested changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now return the correct number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line in different scenarios, meeting the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
