### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class and is responsible for computing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function takes the current line and some internal state variables as input.

### Bug Location
The bug might be present in the logic related to updating the `before` variable, handling the `depth`, and the conditions inside the function that determine the number of empty lines to be returned.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `before` variable is being updated incorrectly. It is set to either the count of newlines in the `prefix` of the first leaf or `1` based on certain conditions. This logic might lead to incorrect values for `before`.
2. The handling of `depth` and updating the `previous_defs` list seems to be incorrect, especially when determining whether to insert empty lines based on previous definitions.
3. The conditions related to different types of lines (decorator, flow control, import, yield) and the return values based on these conditions might be incorrectly evaluating the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic for updating the `before` variable to correctly handle the count of newlines.
2. Update the logic for `depth` and managing the `previous_defs` list to ensure the correct calculation of empty lines based on indentation levels.
3. Review and correct the conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the type of the current line.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.depth in self.previous_defs:
        before = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        self.previous_defs = [d for d in self.previous_defs if d < current_line.depth]

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version makes adjustments to properly update the `before` variable, manage the `previous_defs` list, and evaluate conditions for returning the number of empty lines before and after the current line accurately.
