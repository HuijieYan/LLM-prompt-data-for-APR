### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable. The function is supposed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines before the currently processed line, but in some cases, it fails to update the `before` value correctly based on the conditions.

### Bug Location
The main issue lies in the block of code where the variable `before` is updated to a value of 1 if the `depth` condition is met and the `previous_defs` list is being updated. This causes the `before` value to become 1 even when it should remain 0.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `before` value is updated correctly based on the conditions provided in the function. Specifically, we need to make sure that the value of `1` is only assigned to `before` when the conditions justify it, and in all other cases, the `before` value should remain as calculated earlier in the function.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and
            depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and
            self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the `before` variable assignment and ensuring its proper updating based on the conditions, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now produce the expected output values for all the test cases provided.
