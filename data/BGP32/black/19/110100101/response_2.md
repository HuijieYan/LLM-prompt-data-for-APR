### Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is checking various conditions based on the input `current_line` and previous context to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. The function tracks the depth, type of line (decorator, def, class, etc.), and previous line information to make these decisions. 

#### Bugs:
1. In the first `if` condition where it checks `if current_line.depth == 0`, the code assigns `max_allowed = 2`. This should be corrected to `max_allowed = 1` as per the function's logic.
2. In the last return statement, the function returns `before, 0` which is incorrect. This should be corrected to return `before, 1`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the first `if` condition to correctly assign `max_allowed = 1` when `current_line.depth == 0`.
2. Correct the last return statement to return `before, 1` instead of `before, 0`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 1
