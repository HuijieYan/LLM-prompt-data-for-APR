### Analysis
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The logic for updating the `before` variable inside the while loop is not handling the depth condition correctly.
2. The if conditions for checking the type of the current line are not correctly returning the expected values for newlines.
3. The function lacks proper handling for different scenarios related to the current line and the previous line.

### Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect logic inside the while loop that updates the `before` variable. Additionally, the conditions for determining the number of newlines to return based on the type of the current and previous lines are not functioning as expected.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function, we need to:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly inside the while loop based on the depth condition.
2. Adjust the if conditions for determining the number of newlines to return based on the type of the current and previous lines.
3. Add proper handling for various scenarios related to the type of lines.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected values based on the input parameters.
