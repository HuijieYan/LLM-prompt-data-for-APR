### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is incorrectly handling the logic to determine the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are several issues present in the function:

1. The logic for adjusting the `before` variable based on the `depth` of the current line and the `self.previous_defs` list is not functioning correctly.

2. The logic for returning the number of newlines based on the type of line (decorator, def, class, etc.) and the relationship with the previous line is not correctly implemented.

3. The function is returning incorrect values for the number of empty lines that should be inserted before and after the current line for various scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the calculation of the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on the input parameters provided.
2. Ensure that the function correctly considers the type of the current line and its relationship with the previous line to determine the number of empty lines needed.
3. Update the function to return the correct values for the number of newlines before and after the current line based on the specified scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    else:
        max_allowed = 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
          
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic within the function to properly handle the scenarios described in the test cases, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are returned before and after the current line based on the input parameters and context provided.
