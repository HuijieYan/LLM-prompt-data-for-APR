### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for updating the `before` variable. The code is designed to handle different scenarios based on the type of the current line, but the logic for updating `before` is not consistent throughout the function. In some cases, the `before` value is calculated correctly, but in other cases, it is set to a fixed value without considering the actual prefix of the line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on the prefix of the current line in all relevant scenarios. This involves calculating the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf and ensuring that the `before` value is updated accordingly. Additionally, we need to handle updating `before` when conditions change within the function to reflect the actual number of empty lines needed.

### Updated `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the bug explanation and the expected input/output values:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the prefix of the current line in all relevant scenarios, fixing the bug present in the original implementation.
