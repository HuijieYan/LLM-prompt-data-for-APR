### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the logic used to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. There are issues in handling the `self.previous_defs` list, updating the `before` variable, and the conditions for returning the number of empty lines.

1. In the case where `current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class`, the logic for updating the `before` variable when popping from `self.previous_defs` is incorrect.
2. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines based on different line types are not properly implemented.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Update the logic for updating the `before` variable when popping from `self.previous_defs`.
2. Modify the conditions for returning the number of empty lines based on different line types to ensure correct output for each case.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            popped_depth = self.previous_defs.pop()
            if popped_depth == 0:
                before = 2
            if len(self.previous_defs) == 0:
                break

    if current_line.is_decorator and self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output for each scenario.
