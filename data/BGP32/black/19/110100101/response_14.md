### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, it has some logical errors which are causing it to produce incorrect results.

1. The variable `before` is being updated in multiple places, which could lead to incorrect calculations.
2. The condition checks for certain line types (decorators, defs, etc.) and adjusts the newlines to be returned accordingly. These conditions may not be correctly handling all cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the variable `before` is updated correctly and only once based on the calculations required.
2. Review and update the conditional logic for different line types to ensure that the correct number of newlines are returned.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    newlines = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= current_line.depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the different cases and conditions correctly based on the expected input/output values provided for the failing test cases.
