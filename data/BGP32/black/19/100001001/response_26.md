### Bug Analysis:
The bug is related to the calculation of the number of empty lines to insert before a given line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is expected to return a tuple `(int, int)` representing the number of empty lines before the current line and after it. However, based on the provided runtime values, the function is not correctly calculating the number of empty lines in some cases.

Here is the analysis of the bug based on the provided runtime values:
1. In Case 1, the function is incorrectly returning `(2, 0)` instead of `(0, 0)`. This is because the condition `if self.previous_line is None` is not correctly handling the case where the `self.previous_line` object is not None.
   
2. In Case 2, the function correctly returns `(2, 0)`.

3. In Case 3, the function incorrectly returns `(2, 0)` instead of `(0, 0)` for the same reason as in Case 1.

4. In Case 4, the function correctly returns `(2, 0)`.

5. In Case 5, the function incorrectly returns `(2, 0)` instead of `(0, 0)` for the same reason as in Case 1.

6. In Case 6, the function correctly returns `(0, 2)`.

7. In Case 7, the function correctly returns `(0, 1)`.

8. In Case 8, the function incorrectly returns `(1, 0)` instead of `(0, 0)` because the condition `if self.previous_line is None` is not properly handling the case.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the condition `if self.previous_line is None` needs to be corrected to handle the case where the `self.previous_line` object is not None. The function should properly calculate the number of empty lines based on the defined conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if depth > 0 else 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the condition and adjusting the logic within the function, the corrected version should now produce the expected output based on the given runtime values and conditions.
