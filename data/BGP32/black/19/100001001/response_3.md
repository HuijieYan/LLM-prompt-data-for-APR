### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when calculating the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions, leading to incorrect output values for certain cases.

1. In Case 1, the function fails to insert the correct number of empty lines before a decorator. It should insert 2 empty lines before a decorator, but it only returns 1 empty line.

2. In Case 2, the function fails to insert 1 empty line before the current line as the previous line is not a decorator. It incorrectly returns 0 empty lines instead.

3. In Case 3, the function fails to account for the empty lines to insert before a decorator, leading to incorrect output.

4. In Case 4, a similar issue to Case 2 occurs where the function incorrectly inserts 0 empty lines before the current line.

5. In Case 5, the function incorrectly considers the previous line when deciding the number of empty lines to insert before the current line, resulting in an incorrect output.

6. In Case 6, the function fails to handle the correct number of empty lines to insert after a decorator.

7. In Case 7, the function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines after a function definition.

8. In Case 8, the function fails to insert the correct number of empty lines based on the current line's depth and the previous definitions.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` to correctly calculate and return the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on the given conditions. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before decorators, function definitions, and based on the current line's depth.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This version addresses the specific cases described above where the function was producing incorrect outputs. It ensures that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the conditions specified for different types of lines and their relationships with the previous lines.
