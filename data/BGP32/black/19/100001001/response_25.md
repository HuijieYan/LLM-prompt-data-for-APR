The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` is that the logic to determine the number of empty lines to insert is flawed. The function is supposed to return a tuple containing the number of empty lines before and after the current line. However, the logic to calculate these values is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly calculate the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the given conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the logic to determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line has been adjusted to handle the different conditions appropriately. The function now correctly calculates the necessary number of empty lines based on the provided input parameters and their relationships.
