### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic handling the insertion of empty lines based on line types and previous line conditions. The function is not correctly determining the number of newlines to insert in certain cases, causing incorrect formatting.

### Bug Location
The bug can be spotted in the conditional statements where the number of newlines is being calculated based on different line types and relationships with the previous line.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of the number of newlines to insert. In some cases, the function is returning an incorrect number of newlines based on the conditions of current and previous lines.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert needs to be adjusted. Specifically, focus on the conditions where newlines are being calculated based on line types and relationships with the previous line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the logic issues causing incorrect newline insertion in the original function. It ensures that the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the line types and their relationships with the previous line.
