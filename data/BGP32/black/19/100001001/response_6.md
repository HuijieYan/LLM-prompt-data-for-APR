### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the logic of handling empty lines in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is designed to determine whether to insert empty lines based on certain conditions related to the structure of the code lines. In particular, the bug is present when calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line.

#### Issue:
The bug arises when setting the value of `before` inside the `while` loop that iterates over `self.previous_defs`. 
- `before` is reassigned to `1 if depth else 2`, regardless of whether `depth` is 0 or not. This leads to incorrect behavior, especially when `depth` is 0, affecting the number of empty lines to be inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `while` loop to correctly calculate the number of empty lines based on the depth of the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    for prev_depth in reversed(self.previous_defs):
        if prev_depth < depth:
            break
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

I have adjusted the logic inside the `for` loop to properly update the `before` value based on the depth relation between `prev_depth` and the current line's depth. This fix ensures correct handling of empty lines before the current line based on the code structure and depth levels.
