### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. The issue arises from incorrect handling of the `before` variable in certain cases, leading to unexpected results in determining the number of empty lines.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function is correctly determining `before` based on the `depth` of the `current_line`. However, the subsequent conditions that check for different line types and scenarios are not properly handled, leading to discrepancies in the final return value.

2. In Cases 2, 3, and 4, where the `current_line` is not a decorator, but the previous line is also not a decorator, the expected behavior is not maintained. This inconsistency is due to the way the `before` value is manipulated within the function.

3. In Case 5, the presence of the `is_yield` condition is not handled correctly, affecting the `before` value set in the return statement.

4. In Cases 6 and 8, the representation of previous and current lines with different leaves or attributes does not result in the proper computation of empty lines before the current line.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug and correct the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the logic for determining the value of `before` and subsequently calculating the number of empty lines before the current line needs to be revised. By ensuring proper conditions and handling for each line type and scenario, the function can provide accurate results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By revising the logic and ensuring proper handling of different scenarios, the corrected version of the function should provide accurate results for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.
