### Bug Explanation:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines based on specific conditions and context provided by the `current_line` parameter and the state of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. However, there are a couple of issues causing incorrect behavior:
1. The condition `if depth:` in the while loop is causing problems when `depth` is 0. It sets `before` to 2, but this assignment is not correct in all cases.
2. The logic related to `before` and the handling of various types of lines (decorators, flow control, imports, yield, etc.) is not consistent and can lead to incorrect empty line insertion.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following modifications should be made:
1. Correct the logic for setting `before` inside the while loop when `depth` is 0.
2. Adjust the conditions and logic related to setting the number of empty lines to be inserted based on various line types and context.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines += 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues in the original function and ensure correct handling of empty line insertion based on the provided context and conditions.
