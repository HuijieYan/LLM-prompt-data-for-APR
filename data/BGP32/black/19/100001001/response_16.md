### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the handling of the `before` variable when checking `self.previous_defs` conditions. In some cases, the `before` variable is being set incorrectly, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Analysis
1. In Case 1, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.
2. In Case 2, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.
3. In Case 3, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.
4. In Case 4, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.
5. In Case 5, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.
6. In Case 6, the `before` variable is incorrectly set to 2 when it should be 0 before the function's return.
7. In Case 7, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.
8. In Case 8, the `before` variable is correctly set to 0 before the function's return.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is set correctly in all cases. The `before` variable should only be set to 1 if the depth is 0, and it should be set to 0 otherwise. 

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 0 if depth == 0 else 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the condition within the `while` loop to correctly set the `before` variable based on the depth, the function should now handle the cases correctly and return the expected output.
