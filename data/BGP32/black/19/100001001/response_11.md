### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines in the code based on certain conditions related to the input `current_line`. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the insertion of newlines before the first line in the file, the exclusion of empty lines between decorators, and the correct handling of flow control statements, imports, and yields.

The bug occurs in the conditions where the function should return specific values to control the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions related to the `current_line`.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition for not inserting empty lines before the first line in the file.
2. Update the condition for not inserting empty lines between decorators.
3. Update the handling of flow control statements, imports, and yields to return the correct number of empty lines.

### Fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the conditions for handling empty lines have been updated to ensure the correct behavior of inserting empty lines in various code structures.
