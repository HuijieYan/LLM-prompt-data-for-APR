### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle adding empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current line in the code snippet. However, it seems to have some issues with correctly determining when to insert empty lines. The issues arise from the handling of `before` variable and the conditionals that check for the type of the current line.

### Bug Explanation
1. The variable `before` is being modified inside the loop that removes previous definitions. This loop is erroneously updating `before` for each iteration, which can lead to incorrect values assigned to `before` by the end of the loop.
2. The conditions checking for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, and `is_class` are not properly distinguishing the cases where empty lines should be inserted or not.

### Bug Fix
To fix the identified issues, the `before` variable should be correctly updated only once within the loop. Additionally, the conditions checking for the current line type should be reevaluated to accurately determine when to insert empty lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before if before else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before if before else 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles the `before` variable and revises the conditions related to the type of the current line to ensure proper insertion of empty lines.
