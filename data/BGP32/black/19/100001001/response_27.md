### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the calculation of the number of lines to be inserted before the current line. The function is intended to determine the number of empty lines to add based on different conditions, such as the type of line (e.g., decorator, flow control) and the relationship with the previous line.

However, in the buggy code, in cases where the `is_decorator` condition is met, the function incorrectly handles the logic of adding empty lines. When the current line is a decorator, the function should not insert empty lines before or after it. But the buggy code erroneously calculates and returns `newlines = 2` when `is_decorator` is True, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic related to decorators in the function. When the current line is a decorator, we should simply return `0, 0` to indicate that no empty lines should be added before or after the decorator. This adjustment will ensure that the correct behavior is maintained for decorator lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        return 0, 0  # Adjusted to return 0, 0 for decorators

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this adjustment, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function will now correctly handle the case of decorators, ensuring that no empty lines are inserted before or after a decorator line.
