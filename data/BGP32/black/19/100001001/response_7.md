### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` aims to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the number of empty lines to be inserted in various cases.

### Issues in the buggy function:
1. The variable `before` is being overwritten in the `while` loop, which is causing incorrect calculations.
2. The condition in the `while` loop (`before = 1 if depth else 2`) seems problematic and might not produce the desired outcome.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the `before` variable within the `while` loop, leading to unexpected results in determining the number of empty lines to insert.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly without overwriting the calculated value.
2. Update the condition in the `while` loop to accurately determine the value assigned to `before`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    initial_before = before  # Store the initial value of before
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = initial_before
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By storing the initial value of `before` before entering the `while` loop and updating the condition within the loop, the correct behavior should be restored to the function.
