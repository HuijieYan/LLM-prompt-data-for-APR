### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs in the conditional checks related to `is_decorator`. When the `current_line` is identified as a decorator, it should handle the logic differently, such as not inserting empty lines before the first line in the file and not inserting empty lines between decorators. However, the current implementation doesn't consider all the necessary conditions within these blocks, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic within the `is_decorator` block to correctly handle the cases where the `current_line` is a decorator. Specifically, we need to ensure that it adheres to the correct rules for inserting empty lines based on whether it is the first line or a line between decorators.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function includes the necessary checks and conditions to handle decorators appropriately and ensure correct insertion of empty lines based on the context of the code being processed.
