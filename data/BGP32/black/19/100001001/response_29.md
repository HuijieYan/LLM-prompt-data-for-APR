The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` arises from incorrect handling of indentation depth and empty lines insertion logic. 

The bug is primarily caused by the calculation of `before` variable and the handling of `depth` in various conditions. The `before` variable is being overwritten in multiple places leading to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the logic for inserting empty lines based on indentation levels is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of `before`, ensure proper handling of indentation levels, and correct the insertion of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version handles the `before` variable more consistently and adjusts the logic for inserting empty lines based on indentation levels. It should now work correctly based on the provided test cases and fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
