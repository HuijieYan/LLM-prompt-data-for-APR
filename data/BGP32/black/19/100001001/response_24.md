### Bug Explanation:
In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, there is a bug where the handling of `before` variable is incorrect. The function calculates and assigns values to `before` based on certain conditions, but then mistakenly overrides these values in subsequent parts of the code. This leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect output in some cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug is present in the block of code where `before` variable is set multiple times based on different conditions. The issue arises when `before` is overridden before returning the final output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the values assigned to `before` are not mistakenly overridden in the subsequent code sections. We need to maintain the correct value of `before` based on the initial conditions set in the function without unwanted reassignments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By preventing unnecessary reassignments to the `before` variable, the corrected version of the function should now provide the expected output and behave correctly in all cases.
