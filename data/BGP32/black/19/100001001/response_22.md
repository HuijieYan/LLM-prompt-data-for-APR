### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The condition `if self.previous_line is None` is not handling the case where `self.previous_line` is `None` correctly, causing unexpected behavior.
2. The logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in specific cases is not processing all conditions accurately, which may lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to make the following modifications:
1. Update the conditional statement `if self.previous_line is None` to check for both `None` and `False` conditions to handle the case when `self.previous_line` is not the first line in the file.
2. Refactor the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in different scenarios to ensure accurate processing.
3. Update the conditions and return values to reflect the correct behavior based on the runtime input values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is False or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line is False
        or (self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import)
        or (depth == self.previous_line.depth and not current_line.is_import)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line is False
        or (self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth))
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the conditional statements and return values have been updated to handle all edge cases and ensure that the function processes the input correctly to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line.
