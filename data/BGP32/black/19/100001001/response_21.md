### Bug Explanation
The current implementation of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function has a bug where it incorrectly handles the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the input parameters provided. The issue arises in the logic that determines the number of newlines to insert before the current line.

### Bug Analysis
1. In cases where `current_line` is a decorator, `is_def`, or `is_class`, the function returns the wrong number of newlines to insert. This occurs because the function does not properly handle these cases and calculates the newlines incorrectly.
2. The conditions for handling `is_import` and `is_yield` in relation to the previous line are incorrect and lead to unexpected results in determining the number of newlines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling empty lines based on the given conditions and relationships between the current line and the previous line. Here are the steps for the bug fix:
1. Update the logic for when `current_line` is a decorator, `is_def`, or `is_class` to correctly determine the number of newlines to insert.
2. Revise the conditions for `is_import` and `is_yield` to ensure proper handling of these cases.
3. Make sure that all edge cases and relationships between the current line and the previous line are considered when calculating the number of empty lines to insert.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the bug analysis and fix strategy provided, here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return min(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if (self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return min(1, current_line.prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return min(current_line.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed), 0
```

This corrected version should address the bugs present in the original function and ensure proper handling of empty lines based on the given conditions and input parameters.
