The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the calculation of the `newlines` variable inside the condition where `is_decorator`, `is_def`, or `is_class` are true. The calculation is not considering the case when `current_line.is_decorator` is true, leading to incorrect output. The `newlines` value calculation is not intuitive and needs refinement.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `newlines` value considering the `is_decorator` case separately. We need to update the logic to handle the case when `is_decorator` is true, as the current implementation is returning incorrect results in that scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if not is_decorator else 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic to calculate `newlines` properly and considering the `is_decorator` case separately, the function should now return correct results for all cases, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
