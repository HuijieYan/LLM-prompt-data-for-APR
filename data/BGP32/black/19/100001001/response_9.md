### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of newlines to output. The logic seems to mistakenly overwrite the value of `before` when checking conditions related to flow control, imports, and yields. This results in incorrect newline counts being returned.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable retains its value for the correct number of newlines, and we need to update the logic for deciding when to return newlines based on different conditions. Specifically, we need to handle the cases of flow control, imports, and yields correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 0
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines += 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correctly handling the conditions for different cases and ensuring that the `before` variable retains the correct newline count, the corrected version of the function should resolve the bug.
