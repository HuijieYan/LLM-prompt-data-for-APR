The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the condition that checks if the previous line is an import statement. The function attempts to access the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object, assuming it to be a direct property. However, in the function definition, there is no attribute named `is_import` defined for the `Line` class, that's why it throws an error and fails the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where it's checking for the previous line to be an import. We should use the `is_import` function which is defined in the same file. By calling this function with the `previous_line` as an argument, we can properly check if the line is an import or not.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change, the function should now properly handle the check for the previous line being an import statement using the `is_import` function, thus fixing the bug and passing the failing test.
