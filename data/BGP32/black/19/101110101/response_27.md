Based on the provided information, there are several potential issues in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` that need to be addressed:

1. The function is not correctly handling the case where the current line is a decorator. It's not updating the `previous_defs` list and incorrectly determining the number of newlines to return when the line is a decorator.
2. The function incorrectly checks for `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of `is_import(self.previous_line)` which leads to an attribute error.
3. The function does not accurately handle the case where the current line is a yield statement.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function logic to properly handle decorators, imports, and yield statements.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if is_import(self.previous_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the cases mentioned in the failing test and pass the expected input/output values.
