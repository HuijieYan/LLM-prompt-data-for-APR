### Strategy for fixing the bug:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in these conditions and ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the conditions specified in the function.

Here are the key points to focus on for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned depending on the conditions specified in the function.
2. Validate the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yield statements to handle each case appropriately.
3. Consider the depth and previous definitions when determining the number of newlines.

### Corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the function according to the suggested strategy, the function should now be able to handle the different scenarios based on the conditions provided and pass the failing test cases.
