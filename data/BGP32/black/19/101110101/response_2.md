Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect comparison of `current_line.is_import` with `self.previous_line.is_import` without properly checking if the `is_import` function should be used. The bug causes incorrect empty line handling when encountering import statements.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` function is invoked correctly to determine if a line is an import line. Additionally, we should compare the results of the `is_import` function for both `current_line` and `self.previous_line`.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_import_current = is_import(current_line)
    is_import_previous = (
        self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line)
    )

    if is_import_previous and not is_import_current and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This correction should address the bug related to handling import statements properly and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all the provided test cases.
