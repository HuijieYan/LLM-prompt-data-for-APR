The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by not correctly handling the logic related to empty lines. The function wrongly calculates the number of empty lines that should be inserted before the current line based on specific conditions. The bug leads to incorrect results when determining whether empty lines should be added.

To address this issue, we need to reevaluate the conditions and logic within the function to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the context of the current line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the `if` conditions and handling the cases where empty lines should or should not be inserted correctly, the function should produce the expected results for the given test cases.
