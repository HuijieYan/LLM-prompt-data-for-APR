### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function `_maybe_empty_lines` encounters a situation where the previous line is an import but the current line is not an import, and their depths are the same. In this case, the function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the conditions that check the previous line and the current line to correctly handle the case when the previous line is an import and the current line is not an import.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return before, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        return before, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the condition that checks the previous line and sets the number of newlines to insert, the corrected function should now correctly handle the case described in the failing test.
