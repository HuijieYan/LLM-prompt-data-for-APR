The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields. The function fails to correctly determine the number of empty lines needed before a given line based on the line properties and previous lines.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic related to decorators, imports, and yields. We also need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the number of empty lines required based on the given conditions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and
        self.previous_line.is_import and
        not current_line.is_import and
        depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        
        return before or 1, 0

    if (self.previous_line and
        self.previous_line.is_yield and
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields, the corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
