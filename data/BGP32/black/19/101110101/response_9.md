The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to stem from not correctly identifying whether a line is an import line. The function calls `is_import` on `current_line.is_import`, but `is_import` is a function that takes `Leaf` as an argument, not `bool` as expected by `_maybe_empty_lines`.

To fix this bug, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should directly check the type of the first leaf in the current line to determine if it is an import line. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        is_import_line = first_leaf.type in {NAME, ASYNC, AWAIT, AT}
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if is_import_line else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves
        and self.previous_line.leaves[0].type == AT
        and not is_import_line
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.leaves
        and self.previous_line.leaves[0].type == YIELD_EXPR
        and (not is_import_line or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This fix directly checks the type of the first leaf in the current line to determine if it is an import line, and then proceeds accordingly. This should resolve the import-related bugs in the function based on the provided failing test cases.
