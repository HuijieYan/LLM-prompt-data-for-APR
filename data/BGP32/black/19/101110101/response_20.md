### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not properly handling the condition related to checking if the `current_line` is an import statement. The issue arises from the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import`, as the function `is_import` is a separate function defined in the file `black.py` and not a property of the `Line` class.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is expecting `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `current_line.is_decorator` properties to properly determine the behavior, but these properties are not being set correctly or are causing issues with the comparison logic. The relevant properties are not properly evaluated within the `Line` class or the `EmptyLineTracker` class, leading to incorrect behavior in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `Line` class has appropriate methods or properties to determine whether the line is an import, yield, flow control, def, class, or decorator. 
2. Update the `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` function to correctly determine if a given `Leaf` represents an import statement.
3. Modify the `EmptyLineTracker` class to correctly set the properties of the `current_line` object when initializing or updating.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with a call to the `is_import` function which correctly determines if the previous line is an import statement. Make sure to update the `is_import` function accordingly to accurately identify import statements.
