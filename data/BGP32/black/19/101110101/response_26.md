The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a logical error that causes incorrect output in certain cases, leading to failing test cases. The bug is mainly related to the handling of newlines before and after certain types of lines, and it also has issues with the management of `self.previous_defs`.

The bug occurs in the logic involving when to return the number of newlines before and after a given line. The issue arises from how newlines are counted and assigned based on different conditions, such as decorators, imports, yields, etc.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the number of newlines before and after a line based on the context. We also need to ensure that the handling of `self.previous_defs` is consistent and correctly updated.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version takes into account the different conditions for handling newlines before and after lines, updates the `self.previous_defs` correctly, and provides the expected behavior based on the specified test cases. This should help the function pass the failing test and produce the desired output.
