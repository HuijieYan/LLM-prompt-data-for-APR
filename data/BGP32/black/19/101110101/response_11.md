Looking at the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`, one issue that stands out is the condition surrounding the call to `is_import` method. The current implementation uses the expression `self.previous_line.is_import` which is incorrect, as `self.previous_line` is an instance of `Line` and not a direct check for an import statement.

To fix this bug, we should be calling the `is_import` function passing the `self.previous_line` as an argument. We will then use the result of that function call to determine whether the line is an import. Additionally, we need to update the types of certain variables and ensure that we handle the logic correctly based on the expected test cases.

Let's correct and update the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_previous_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_previous_line_import  # Updated logic for checking import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly handle the logic for determining empty lines and importing statements, thus passing the failing test cases.
