## Bug Analysis
The buggy function, `_maybe_empty_lines`, is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines based on specific conditions related to the structure of the code. The bug seems to be related to the handling of situations where empty lines need to be inserted, primarily when dealing with decorators and previous lines.

1. In Case 1, when the `current_line` is a decorator, the function incorrectly returns `2` newlines, failing to insert any empty lines before the decorator. This results in a formatting discrepancy between the actual and expected outputs.

2. In Case 5, a similar situation occurs where the function fails to insert empty lines before a decorator, causing a formatting mismatch.

3. In Case 7, when the `current_line` is a function definition, the function incorrectly prepares to insert an empty line but fails to do so in practice.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the following strategies can be employed:

1. Adjust the conditions related to decorators to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before decorators.
2. Ensure that the function correctly determines when to insert empty lines before various code structures, such as function definitions.
3. Validate the logic for storing and using `self.previous_defs` to maintain consistency in inserting empty lines.

## Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            newlines = max(0, 2 - before)  # Corrected insertion of newlines
        else:
            newlines = 0 if before > 1 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the identified bug scenarios and ensure the correct insertion of empty lines based on the specified conditions.
