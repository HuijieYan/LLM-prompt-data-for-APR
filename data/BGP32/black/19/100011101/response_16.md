Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the provided runtime values, expected values, and corresponding error messages, the bug seems to stem from the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, specifically in the section responsible for determining the number of newlines to be inserted before the current line. The function's handling of decorators, yield statements, and imports might not be consistent with the expected behavior, leading to incorrect insertion of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be revised to handle these scenarios correctly:

1. Ensure that newlines are inserted appropriately based on the conditions specified in the function.
2. Update the logic related to handling decorators, yield statements, and imports to align with the expected behavior.
3. Adjust the line spacing insertion within the function to match the intended formatting rules.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line.is_decorator and not current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic of the function as outlined above, the function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the specified conditions, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values.
