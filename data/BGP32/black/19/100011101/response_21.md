### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when handling `self.previous_defs`. Specifically, when updating `before` variable based on the depth of the current line, the code mistakenly assigns values based on the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2`. This logic results in incorrect assignment of values to the `before` variable, causing unexpected behavior in subsequent comparisons and returns in the function.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the inappropriate assignment of values to the `before` variable based on the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2`. This condition wrongly assigns `before` different values depending on the truthiness of depth, whereas it should calculate it based on the actual depth of the current line.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for setting the `before` variable based on the depth of the current line. We should set `before` equal to `1` if the depth of the current line is non-zero, otherwise set it to `2`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth != 0 else 2  # Corrected logic for setting 'before' based on depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying the corrected logic for assigning values to the `before` variable based on the depth of the current line, the function should now correctly handle the cases and pass the failing tests.
