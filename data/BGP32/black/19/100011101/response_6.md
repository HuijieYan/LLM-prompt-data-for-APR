The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the failing test because it is not correctly handling the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert. Let's analyze the issue:

1. In the failing test, we can see that the actual output does not match the expected output. The discrepancy arises from the function incorrectly calculating the number of newlines to insert in certain conditions.

2. The bug seems to be related to the `newlines` calculation logic when `is_decorator` is `True`. This is evident from the cases where the previous line is a decorator, causing the function to return fewer newlines than expected.

3. The bug occurs because the function mistakenly calculates the number of newlines to insert based on the current line's depth, without properly considering the presence of decorators in the previous line.

4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `newlines` calculation when `is_decorator` is `True` to account for the cases where the previous line or the current line is a decorator.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines when decorators are involved.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version adjusts the `is_decorator` condition to skip inserting empty lines between decorators, fixing the issue in the original function.
