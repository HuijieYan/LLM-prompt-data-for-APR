The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle the logic of inserting empty lines in Python code based on specific conditions. From analyzing the function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in determining the correct number of empty lines to insert under various conditions.

### Observations:
1. The function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines to insert, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
2. The handling of decorators, definitions, imports, and flow control statements seems to be incorrect based on the failing test cases.
3. The logic for updating `before` and `newlines` variables based on different conditions is flawed, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert in specific scenarios. For cases involving decorators, `before`, and `newlines` are not properly updated, causing discrepancies.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for calculating the number of empty lines based on decorators, definitions, imports, and flow control statements.
2. Ensure correct handling of `before` and `newlines` variables in different scenarios.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1 if max_allowed else 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1 if max_allowed else 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as described above, the function should now correctly handle the conditions for inserting empty lines as expected in the failing test cases.
