The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before a line. The bug causes incorrect newline insertion before certain types of lines like decorators, defs, and classes. The current logic does not handle these cases correctly, leading to failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of newlines based on the type of the current line and whether it is a decorator, def, class, or import statement. We also need to handle the case where a line is a yield statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues causing failing tests and provide the expected behavior for determining empty lines before specific types of lines.
