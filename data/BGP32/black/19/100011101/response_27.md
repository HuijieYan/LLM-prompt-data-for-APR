The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before the current line is not correctly handling the cases where the current line is a decorator, function definition, class definition, or flow control. This results in incorrect placement of empty lines in the output, causing the test cases to fail.

The bug stems from the inconsistent handling of `newlines` based on different conditions. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic to accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert based on the current line's characteristics.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if not self.previous_line or self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class:
            return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

This revised version fixes the mentioned issues by explicitly handling different conditions like decorators, function definitions, class definitions, flow control statements, imports, and yield statements separately to ensure proper handling of empty lines.
