The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the failing tests because the logic for handling empty lines is not correctly implemented. The function is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions. However, the current implementation has issues with updating `before` and `depth` values, leading to incorrect results in determining the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, we need to address the following key points:
1. Update the logic for handling `before` and `depth` variables correctly based on different conditions.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles decorators, definitions, imports, and yields to determine the appropriate number of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    if not (self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth):
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With the above corrections, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing tests.
