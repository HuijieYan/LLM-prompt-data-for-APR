The bug in the provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` seems to stem from incorrect handling of the `before` variable's value, specifically when `depth` is `0`. The function incorrectly sets `before` to 1 when `depth` is `0`, regardless of other conditions. This leads to incorrect output in some cases causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `before` variable is assigned based on the conditions of the function. By setting `before` depending on the current conditions correctly, we can ensure that the function behaves as intended and passes the failing tests.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the function handles the `before` variable correctly based on the conditions specified in the function. It should now pass the failing tests by providing the expected output for each case.
