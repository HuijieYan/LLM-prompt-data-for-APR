## Bug Analysis
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle the formatting of empty lines based on the characteristics of the input `current_line`.
2. The function determines the number of empty lines to insert before the `current_line` based on various conditions.
3. The bug seems to be related to determining the appropriate number of empty lines before the `current_line` in specific scenarios.
4. The expected values for empty lines before the `current_line` are not being calculated correctly, leading to incorrect formatting.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before the `current_line` based on the different conditions like decorators, definitions, imports, and yields.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle the scenarios where the formatting of empty lines is incorrect.
3. Ensure that the function returns the expected values based on the input parameters to pass the failing tests.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    # Check if it's a decorator, def, or class
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    # Handle flow control conditions
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    # Check import conditions
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
        
    # Check yield conditions
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the corrected version should now handle the conditions correctly and return the expected values for empty lines before the `current_line`. This should resolve the formatting issues identified in the failing tests.
