### Bug Analysis:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle indentation levels and spacing between lines in Python code, ensuring proper formatting. The bug is related to the handling of empty lines within decorators, which causes differences in the expected and actual output in some test cases.

#### Issues:
1. The logic for determining the number of newlines to insert before a line inside a decorator block is incorrect.
2. The insertion of newlines before flow control statements, imports, and yields is also causing discrepancies in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert in specific cases within decorator blocks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct number of newlines is inserted based on the context of the line (e.g., flow control, imports, yields).

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line:  # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1

        if not current_line.is_def and not current_line.is_class:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 1, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, current_line.leaves[0].prefix.count("\n")), 0

    return 0, 0

```

This corrected version addresses the issues with inserting newlines in decorator blocks, flow control statements, imports, and yields, ensuring that the output matches the expected formatting. It should pass the failing test cases provided.
