The bug in the provided function is that the logic for handling empty lines in decorators, def, and class blocks is not correctly updating the number of newlines to be inserted. This results in incorrect line spacing, leading to failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling empty lines based on the conditions specified in the code. Specifically, we need to update the calculation of the number of newlines to be inserted in different scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        current_depth = current_line.depth
        newlines = 2 - min(current_depth, 1)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0

```

The corrected function should now handle the logic for inserting empty lines correctly based on the given conditions in the code. This should resolve the failing test cases related to incorrect line spacing caused by the buggy function.
