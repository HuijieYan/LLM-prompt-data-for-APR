The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of empty lines and indentation levels. The function is expected to determine the number of new empty lines before the current line based on certain conditions, but it fails to provide the correct number of newlines in some cases, leading to failing tests.

The issue could be due to incorrect logic when determining the number of newlines to insert before the current line. The function should correctly handle cases where newlines need to be inserted or omitted based on various conditions such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, etc.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the number of newlines and adjust the conditions for when to insert or omit empty lines appropriately. The function needs to correctly evaluate the current line's attributes and the previous line to decide on the number of empty lines to insert.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the cases where extra newlines should be inserted or not before the current line based on the specified conditions. This updated version should fix the failing tests and provide the expected behavior.
