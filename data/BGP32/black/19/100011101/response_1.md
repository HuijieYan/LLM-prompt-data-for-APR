The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly handling the condition to add empty lines based on the current line's properties. The bug causes the function to produce incorrect output, leading to failing tests. 

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic to consider the correct conditions for adding empty lines. Specifically, we need to adjust the conditions related to decorators, definitions, classes, imports, yields, and flow control.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    
    # Adjust max_allowed for depth 0
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        limit = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
        before = limit

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with the original function by adjusting the conditions for adding empty lines to align with the expected behavior. It should now pass the failing tests and produce the correct output based on the given inputs.
