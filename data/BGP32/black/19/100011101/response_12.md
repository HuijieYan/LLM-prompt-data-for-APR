The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing incorrect behavior leading to failing test cases. The issue arises from how the function is handling the insertion of empty lines. The function has several conditions and assignments that are not correctly updating the variables, causing the function to return unexpected values.

The bug occurs primarily when determining the number of newlines to insert before a line. The function is not correctly updating the `before` variable based on certain conditions, resulting in incorrect insertion of newlines. 

To fix the bug, the function must accurately update the `before` variable based on the conditions in the function and ensure that the correct number of newlines are inserted.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class or is_decorator:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - int(bool(current_line.depth))
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the `before` variable accurately based on the conditions and fixing the logic for calculating the number of newlines to insert, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
