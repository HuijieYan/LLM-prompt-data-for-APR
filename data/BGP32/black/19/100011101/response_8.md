### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle scenarios where empty lines need to be inserted based on specific conditions like decorators, imports, etc. However, based on the failing test cases provided, it seems that the function is not handling the insertion of empty lines correctly, leading to mismatches in the expected and actual outputs.

Looking at the code logic and the provided runtime and expected values, here are some observations:
1. The function determines the number of empty lines to be inserted based on various conditions. However, the actual implementation of these conditions might be incorrect.
2. The calculation of the variable `before` seems inconsistent as it is modified multiple times within the function.
3. The logic for handling different cases such as decorators, imports, or yield statements may not be correctly capturing the required empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be corrected to properly handle the scenarios where empty lines should be inserted. Here are some steps to consider for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted is correct for each condition.
2. Review the handling of different cases like decorators, imports, and yield statements to align with the expected behavior.
3. Update the logic where `before` is calculated to provide consistent results based on the condition checks.
4. Consider refactoring the function to make the code more readable and maintainable.

### Code Fix:
Based on the bug analysis and the identified issues, here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not (current_line.is_import) and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues identified and align it with the expected behavior based on the failing test cases provided.
