The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic of handling empty lines before specific code constructs (e.g., decorators, functions, classes). The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on certain conditions, but it is not handling all cases correctly.

The issue seems to be with the computation of `newlines` for cases where `is_decorator`, `is_def`, or `is_class` are true. The function is not returning the correct number of newlines based on these conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating `newlines` and ensure that the conditionals for different code constructs are correctly handled.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 2

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version of the function should now handle the conditions for empty lines more accurately based on the type of code constructs detected in the input line. Re-running the failing tests should now produce the expected output.
