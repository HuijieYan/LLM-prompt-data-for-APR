### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect handling of empty lines in certain conditions, causing the function to return incorrect values. The cases where the function fails are:

1. When the `current_line` is a decorator, the function does not correctly insert empty lines according to the expected behavior.

2. When there is a comment inside a decorator, it results in an incorrect number of empty lines in the output compared to the expected result.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to accurately handle the insertion of empty lines in the specified conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import:
        if self.previous_line.depth == current_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and current_line.depth < self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the function behaves as expected in cases where decorators and comments are involved, based on the provided failing tests and expected outcomes.
