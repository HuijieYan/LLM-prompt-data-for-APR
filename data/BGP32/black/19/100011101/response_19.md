## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is in the part where it handles whether to insert empty lines based on certain conditions. The incorrect condition check is leading to the incorrect indentation of the code.

### Issue:
In the code snippet:
```python
if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
    if not is_decorator:
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1
    return newlines, 0
```

The code checks if `self.previous_line` is a decorator and returns 0 newlines. This leads to skipping the insertion of empty lines in specific cases where it is needed, causing incorrect indentation.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To correct this bug, we need to make sure that the correct conditions are checked to determine whether to insert empty lines. Specifically, in cases where `current_line` is a decorator, `self.previous_line` should be considered to decide on the insertion of empty lines. In case `self.previous_line` or `current_line` is a decorator, no newlines should be inserted.

## The Corrected Version

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, which has been modified to address the bug:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function will now correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the conditions and improve the indentation logic.
