The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is causing the tests to fail. The function is not correctly handling the insertion of empty lines based on various conditions related to the code structure, comments, decorators, functions, etc.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `before` variable in the function is being incorrectly assigned inside the loop, which may not align with the intended logic.
- The `self.previous_defs` list is not being updated correctly based on specific conditions related to decorators, functions, and imports.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the given conditions.
2. Update the `self.previous_defs` list based on the conditions for decorators, functions, and imports.
3. Make sure that the logic for inserting empty lines before statements is properly handled for decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic for `before` and `self.previous_defs`, the corrected function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly based on the given conditions.
