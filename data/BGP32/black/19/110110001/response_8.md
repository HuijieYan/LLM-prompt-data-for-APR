### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` function.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_in_decorator` specifically tests for comments in decorators and the behavior related to empty lines in such cases.
4. The error message shows that there is an incorrect handling of empty lines in decorators, which is causing the assertion failure. This incorrect behavior is likely due to an issue in determining the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves carefully analyzing the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure proper handling of decorators and their associated empty lines.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle decorators and the insertion of empty lines. We need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the conditions specified for decorators, flow control statements, imports, yields, etc.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0
    
    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        else:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the issue related to incorrect handling of empty lines in decorators should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
