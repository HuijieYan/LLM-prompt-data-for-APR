### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The test `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an `AssertionError` when comparing the expected output with the actual output.
3. The error message shows a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.
4. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.

### Bug
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line. This discrepancy is leading to the test failure.

### Bug Location
The bug might be in the logic of determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on various conditions within the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Review the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure it correctly calculates the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
2. Check the conditions and their outcomes in the function to make sure they align with the intended behavior.
3. Debug the function to understand which condition or calculation is causing the issue.
4. Modify the logic to accurately determine the required number of empty lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line):
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            first_leaf.prefix = ""

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By reviewing the conditions and updating the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the corrected version aims to accurately determine the number of empty lines before and after the current line to address the bug and fix the failing test.
