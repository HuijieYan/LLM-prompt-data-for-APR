### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of empty lines in the input source code.
- The failing test is related to handling comments within decorators, indicating a problem with how empty lines are handled in this scenario.
- The error message shows that the function is not correctly handling the presence of comments within the decorators, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug:
- The bug seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after a line, especially when dealing with decorators that contain comments.
- The function is not properly handling the scenario where comments are present within decorators, leading to an incorrect number of empty lines being added.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle scenarios where comments are present within decorators.
- Ensure that the function considers comments when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after a line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    # Check for decorators with comments
    if current_line.is_decorator and current_line.trailing_comment:
        return 1, 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to specifically handle decorators with comments, ensuring that the correct number of empty lines is returned in that scenario. This should fix the bug and make the function behave correctly in the failing test case.
