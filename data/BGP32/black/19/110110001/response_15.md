### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class implementation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing the expected and actual output using the `assertFormatEqual` method.
3. The error message shows that there are discrepancies in the expected and actual output related to the positions of empty lines.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of empty lines before or after specific types of lines in the code.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve revising the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly determine the necessary number of empty lines before and after each line.

### Bug Fix:
Based on the analysis, the bug fix should focus on updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before and after lines in the code. Here is the corrected version:

```python
# Import needed for dataclass
from dataclasses import dataclass

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    """
    Provides a stateful method that returns the number of potential extra
    empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
    
    Note: this tracker works on lines that haven't been split yet.  It assumes
    the prefix of the first leaf consists of optional newlines.  Those newlines
    are consumed by `maybe_empty_lines()` and included in the computation.
    """

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
        
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
        
            newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the corrected version should address the bug and allow the test `test_comment_in_decorator` to pass successfully.
