#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The test function `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an `AssertionError` due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.
3. The error message indicates a difference in the number of empty lines between the expected and actual outputs.
4. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after a line. The bug may be related to how this function is calculating the empty lines.
5. The failing test indicates that there are discrepancies in the number of empty lines in the decorator section of the input code.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function may be related to how it handles the insertion of empty lines before and after certain types of lines, especially decorators. The incorrect calculation of empty lines in decorator sections is causing the test to fail.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we can revise the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before and after decorators. We need to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        before = 0
        after = 0
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if current_line.depth == 0:
                after = 2
            else:
                after = 1
        elif current_line.is_flow_control:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 0
        
        return before, after
```

In the corrected version, we simplify the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. It now checks for specific conditions such as decorators, flow control, and defaults to no empty lines before or after lines. This revised logic ensures that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the line type.
