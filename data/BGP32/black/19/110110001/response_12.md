### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` is comparing expected and actual formatted code, but it fails due to incorrect handling of empty lines within decorators in the output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after a line, especially with decorators.
5. The current implementation does not handle the case of empty lines within decorators correctly. It sometimes fails to insert the correct number of empty lines.
6. We need to ensure that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` correctly handles the presence of empty lines within decorators and adjusts the number of empty lines accordingly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Firstly, we need to review the logic that handles decorators and determine the correct number of empty lines to be inserted.
2. Adjust the logic to properly account for empty lines within decorators and ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the context of the current line.
3. Check if the previous line is a decorator, and if so, handle the empty line insertion accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Determine the number of empty lines before the current line
    before_empty_lines = 0
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before_empty_lines = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        # Determine the number of empty lines after the current line
        after_empty_lines = 2 - (1 if current_line.depth else 0)
        return before_empty_lines, after_empty_lines

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### By updating the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the incorrect handling of empty lines within decorators should be fixed, and the test should pass successfully.
