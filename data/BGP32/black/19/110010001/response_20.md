### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`. It is responsible for computing the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output related to comment formatting in decorators.

### Bug Identification:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several conditional statements that determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line based on certain conditions.
2. The bug might be related to how the function handles the insertion of empty lines in specific cases, such as decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function might be incorrectly handling the scenario when a comment is present within a decorator block. This issue may lead to miscounting the required empty lines.
2. The failing test shows a difference in the expected and actual output related to comments within decorators, suggesting a problem with the handling of comments in decorators.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` needs to be adjusted to properly handle comments within decorators and ensure the correct number of empty lines is inserted based on the code structure.
2. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments within decorators are considered when calculating the required number of empty lines before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic in the `EmptyLineTracker` class's `_maybe_empty_lines` method, the bug related to comments within decorators should be addressed, leading to the correct calculation and insertion of empty lines according to the code structure.
