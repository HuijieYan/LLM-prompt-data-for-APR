### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The bug occurs in the logic of determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output of the function. It seems there is an issue with the generation of empty lines between certain types of lines.
4. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic of calculating empty lines before and after the current line to ensure it aligns with the expected formatting rules.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is due to incorrect handling of empty lines in certain conditions. This causes a mismatch in the expected and actual output, leading to the failed test.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Review the conditions under which empty lines should be inserted before and after the current line.
2. Ensure that the logic considers all relevant cases such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc.
3. Update the function to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines based on the context of the current line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional, Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return 1, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return 1, 0

        return 0, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function aims to address the bug by ensuring proper handling of empty lines based on the context of the current line. The conditions for inserting empty lines have been revised to align with the expected formatting rules.
