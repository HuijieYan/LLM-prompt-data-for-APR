### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- The error message indicates an assertion error in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case, specifically related to the presence of extra newlines in the output.
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.

### Bug Location:
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of newlines in the `before` variable in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
- The issue might be caused by the updating of `before` variable inside the loop without proper consideration of previous values.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug could be caused by the inconsistent handling of the `before` variable within the function. When updating the value of `before` inside the loop, it might not be retaining the correct number of newlines to be included before the line.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the correct number of extra newlines needed before the line is determined and updated appropriately with respect to the previous value of `before` in different conditions.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth > 0:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

Now, the function should correctly handle the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the currently processed line, addressing the bug that caused the assertion error in the test case.
