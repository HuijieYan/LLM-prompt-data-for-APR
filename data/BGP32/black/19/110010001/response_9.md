### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class, which provides a stateful method for handling empty lines in the source code.
2. The function calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The error message indicates that there is a disagreement in the number of empty lines inserted between the expected and actual output at specific points in the source code.
4. The bug seems to be related to the logic concerning when to insert empty lines based on different line types and depths.
5. The function needs to correctly identify when to insert empty lines based on the type of the current line and the relationship with the previous line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to properly handle situations where empty lines need to be inserted before or after specific line types.
2. Adjust the logic to consider the relationship between the current line and the previous line to determine the correct number of empty lines to insert.
3. Address cases where empty lines should not be inserted based on the type or depth of the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if not self.previous_defs:
        self.previous_defs.append(0)
    
    while self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function adjusts the logic for inserting empty lines before and after the current line based on the type and depth of the line. This revised version should address the bug and ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted in the source code according to the specified conditions.
