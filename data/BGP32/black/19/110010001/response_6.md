### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. The error message indicates a formatting mismatch between the expected output and the actual output.
3. The function is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
4. The bug in the function is likely causing incorrect computation of the number of empty lines, leading to a formatting mismatch in the output.
5. We need to review the conditions and computations in the function to identify and fix the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review the conditions and calculations in `_maybe_empty_lines` to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is calculated based on the specified criteria.
2. Verify the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
3. Make sure that the correct adjustments are made based on the line properties and previous lines.
4. Update the function to correctly handle each case and provide the expected number of empty lines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before or 1, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

After applying these corrections to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class, the function should compute the correct number of empty lines before and after the current line, addressing the bug and resolving the formatting mismatch observed in the failing test.
