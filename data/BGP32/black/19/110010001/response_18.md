### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the function, specifically related to the presence of empty lines within the formatted text.
4. The bug seems to be related to how empty lines are handled within the function, potentially leading to incorrect output when formatting the code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of empty lines within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function may not be properly considering when to add or remove empty lines based on different conditions such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc. This can lead to deviations in the formatted code output, as seen in the failing test results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the logic for handling empty lines based on different conditions needs to be revisited and revised. This involves ensuring that the correct number of empty lines are added or removed before and after each line based on the specific context of the code being processed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        if self.previous_line:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_def or self.previous_line.is_class:
                newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
                return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
            if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
                return max(1, before), 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
            if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                return max(1, before), 0

        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling empty lines has been adjusted based on the different conditions specified in the function. Now, the function should correctly calculate and return the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line, addressing the bug identified in the failing test.
