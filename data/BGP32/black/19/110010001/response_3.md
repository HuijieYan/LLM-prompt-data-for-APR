### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error message indicates a failure in formatting where the expected output does not match the actual output, specifically related to the number of empty lines.
4. The bug could be related to how the function is handling empty lines before and after certain types of lines, such as decorators, flow control, imports, yields, etc.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the logic in determining the number of empty lines before and after a line, especially when it comes to certain conditions like decorators, flow controls, imports, and yields. This results in an incorrect number of empty lines being added or removed during the formatting process.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the logic for handling each type of line (decorators, flow control, imports, yields) to ensure the correct number of empty lines are returned.
2. Make sure that the conditions for adding or removing empty lines are properly handled for different types of lines.
3. Verify that the logic for consuming extra newlines and adjusting the count of empty lines is correct.
4. Consider refactoring the logic to improve readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By ensuring that the logic for handling different types of lines and adjusting the number of empty lines before and after each line is correctly implemented, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
