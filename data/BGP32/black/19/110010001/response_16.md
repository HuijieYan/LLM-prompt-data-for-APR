### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
- It is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The error message indicates a failure related to empty lines in decorators and comments.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line may not be correctly handling decorators and comments.
2. The control flow within the function might not be correctly evaluating all the conditions for empty lines.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of empty lines before and after decorators and comments. The incorrect calculation of empty lines before and after these elements is causing the test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that proper condition checks are in place for decorators and comments to accurately determine the number of empty lines needed.
- Modify the logic to correctly handle decorators, comments, and other special cases where empty lines should be inserted or omitted.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.comment:
        return 0, 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a condition to check if the current line is a decorator or contains a comment. If so, return 0, 0 to prevent adding empty lines.
2. Updated the location of the check for decorators and comments to ensure they are handled correctly before the other conditions.
3. Adjusted the logic for handling different cases that require empty lines to be added or skipped based on the nature of the current line.
