### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class defines a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The error message suggests that there is a discrepancy in the number of empty lines between the expected output and the actual output.
3. The bug seems to be related to the logic of handling empty lines before and after specific types of lines, such as decorators, flow control statements, imports, and yields.
4. The bug may be due to incorrect logic in determining when to insert empty lines based on the type of the current line and the previous line.
  
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review the logic for handling empty lines before and after each type of line to ensure it aligns with the desired behavior.
2. Debug the `_maybe_empty_lines` function by analyzing its behavior for different types of input lines to identify the specific conditions causing the issue.
3. Ensure that the logic properly considers cases where empty lines should be inserted based on the current and previous line types.
4. Add appropriate conditions to correctly determine the number of empty lines before and after each line type to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` Function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        if current_line.depth > 0 and depth := self.previous_defs[-1]:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth == current_line.depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and not current_line.is_yield
            or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should fix the bug related to incorrect empty line handling. It adjusts the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the type of the current and previous lines to align with the expected behavior.
