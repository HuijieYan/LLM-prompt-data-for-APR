### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The error message indicates an assertion error in the `assertFormatEqual` method, suggesting that the expected and actual output do not match.
3. The buggy function is responsible for returning the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of empty lines before and after a line in the source code, leading to a formatting difference.
5. The function needs to properly handle the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after a line in the source code.

### Bug Cause:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is not correctly handling the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after a line. This results in an incorrect number of empty lines being added, leading to a formatting difference between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function and ensure that the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the specific conditions mentioned in the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return (before or 1), 0
        return before, 0
```

By fixing the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines needed before and after a line, resolving the formatting difference issue causing the test failure.
