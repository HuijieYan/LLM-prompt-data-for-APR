### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the class `EmptyLineTracker`.
2. The error message indicates an Assertion error in the test `test_comment_in_decorator`.
3. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling the logic related to adding empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions. It seems like the function is not handling the case of adding empty lines between comments in decorators correctly.
4. The bug might be related to how the function is updating the number of empty lines before and after the current line.
   
### Fix Strategy:
1. Inspecting the error message, it seems that the current logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the case of comments in decorators which leads to an incorrect number of empty lines.
2. We need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the case of comments in decorators.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and (self.previous_line.is_import or self.previous_line.is_decorator)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected version adds a condition to handle the case of comments in decorators correctly and adjusts the logic to update the number of empty lines based on the surrounding context. This should resolve the issue with adding empty lines between comments in decorators.
