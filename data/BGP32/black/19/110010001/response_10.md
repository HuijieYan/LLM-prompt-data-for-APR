### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The error is related to formatting differences in the output generated by the function, as indicated by the failing test.
3. The function determines the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of empty lines or newlines before and after certain types of lines (e.g. decorators, flow control statements).
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates and returns the required number of empty lines based on the conditions provided.

### Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the function to properly handle the conditions and calculate the correct number of empty lines, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
