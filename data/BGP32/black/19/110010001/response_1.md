### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is defined within the class `EmptyLineTracker`. It takes a `current_line` parameter of type `Line` and returns a tuple of two integers.
2. The function is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
3. The error message indicates a failure in comparing the expected formatting with the actual formatting while processing comments within decorators.
4. The logic within the function may not be correctly handling the case involving comments within decorators, leading to incorrect empty line calculations.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to arise from the logic that determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. In the case of comments within decorators, the function may not be adjusting the empty line count correctly, leading to the assertion error in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling comments within decorators to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the context.
2. Specifically, when encountering comments within decorators, adjust the empty line calculation to match the expected output.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if is_decorator and self.previous_line is not None and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    return before, 0
```

### Correction Made:
Added a condition to check for comments within decorators by verifying if the `current_line` is a decorator and the previous line is also a decorator. If this condition is met, the function returns 0 empty lines before and 0 empty lines after.

By incorporating this check, the function should now correctly handle the scenario where comments within decorators are encountered, ensuring the correct number of empty lines is returned.
