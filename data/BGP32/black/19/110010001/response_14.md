### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is a method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The error message is an `AssertionError` indicating a discrepancy between the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` function.
3. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug in this function may lead to incorrect counting of empty lines, which could result in formatting differences between the expected and actual output.
4. The bug seems to be related to the calculation of empty lines before and after the current line. The logic for determining when and how many empty lines to insert appears to be incorrect or missing some conditions.
5. To fix the bug, we need to review the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure it correctly calculates the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line. 

### Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_import:
            before = 1 if not current_line.is_import else 0
        elif self.previous_line.is_yield:
            if not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth:
                before = 1
    else:
        if current_line.is_flow_control and not (current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class):
            return 0, 1

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth > 0:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    return before, 0
```

The fix above addresses the issues with the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function by correctly handling the cases for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line. This should align the formatting output with the expected results and resolve the test failure.
