### Bug Explanation
In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, there is a comparison against `self.previous_line.is_import`, assuming it refers to a method or property of `self.previous_line`. However, `is_import` is actually a separate function defined outside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that takes a `Leaf` object as input.

Since `is_import` is a function, the correct way to call it would be `is_import(current_line)` to check if the current line is an import. This error causes the function to misbehave and fail the test provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `is_import` function with the `current_line` as the parameter. This way, we can properly determine if the current line is an import and adjust the behavior accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

return before, 0
``` 

By correcting the line that previously referenced `self.previous_line.is_import` to correctly call the `is_import` function, the corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases provided.
