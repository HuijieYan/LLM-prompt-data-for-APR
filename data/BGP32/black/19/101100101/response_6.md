### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `Line` object and calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The function seems to handle different cases based on the properties of the `current_line` and the `previous_line`. The bug might be related to the way it handles empty lines for certain conditions.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when checking for specific conditions related to the `previous_line`. In the condition where it checks if `self.previous_line` is an import and the `current_line` is not an import, the buggy function incorrectly uses `self.previous_line.is_import` to determine if the previous line is an import. Since `is_import` is a function and not a property of a `Line` object, the condition always evaluates to False.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine if the previous line is an import by calling the `is_import` function on the `previous_line` inside the condition. By doing this, we can accurately check if the previous line is an import or not.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    previous_line_is_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and previous_line_is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the condition to correctly check if the `previous_line` is an import using the `is_import` function, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
