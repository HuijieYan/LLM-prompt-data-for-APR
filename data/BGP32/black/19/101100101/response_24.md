### Buggy Code Explanation:
The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is designed to handle the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions related to the current line and the previous line in a piece of code. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior and failing the test cases. 

1. The function tries to access the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line`, assuming it exists. But the actual intention is to call the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as an argument. This leads to the AttributeError as the `Line` class does not have an `is_import` attribute.

2. In case of the last `if` statement, there is an incorrect condition check involving `self.previous_line.is_yield` where it should actually check `is_yield` attribute of `current_line`.

3. The function sometimes tries to return an integer value when the return type is defined as Tuple[int, int].

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly call the `is_import` function with the appropriate arguments.
2. Correct the condition check for `current_line.is_yield` in the corresponding `if` statement.
3. Ensure that the return type matches the expected Tuple[int, int].

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_import_previous = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line is not None else False
    is_import_current = is_import(current_line)
    if (
        is_import_previous
        and not is_import_current
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        current_line.is_yield
        and (not is_import_current or depth != current_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By correcting the function as mentioned above, it should pass the failing test cases provided.
