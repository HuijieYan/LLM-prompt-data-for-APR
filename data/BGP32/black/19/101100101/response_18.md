### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect condition for checking if the previous line is an import. The buggy code uses `self.previous_line.is_import` which tries to access an `is_import` attribute on the `previous_line` object. However, `is_import` is actually a function (`is_import(leaf)`) that needs to be called on the `previous_line` leaves.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if the previous line is an import. We should call the `is_import` function on the `leaf` objects of the `previous_line` leaves. This will correctly determine if the previous line was an import.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and any(is_import(leaf) for leaf in self.previous_line.leaves)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

The corrected code section replaces the condition for checking if the previous line was an import with a call to `is_import` function on each leaf of the `previous_line`. This change will correctly identify if the previous line was an import statement.
