The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple issues. Here is an analysis of the root cause of the bug:

1. The function is not properly handling the cases where `current_line.is_import`, `current_line.is_yield`, and `current_line.is_flow_control` conditions are checked. It seems like some conditions are not working as expected.

2. The function seems to have a logical issue with the `while` loop that pops elements from `self.previous_defs`.

3. The handling of `current_line.is_decorator` might be incorrect, as it results in an incorrect return of newline counts.

To fix these issues, we need to correct the conditions and logic in the function. Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the conditions and return the expected values for the given test cases.
