## Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle various scenarios related to inserting empty lines in code. However, there are several issues within the function itself that need to be addressed:

1. The logic for handling previous definitions and decorators seems to have a bug as it does not update the `before` value correctly.
2. The conditions for determining when to insert empty lines are not properly evaluated, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the issues, we need to adjust the logic within the function to handle the different scenarios correctly based on the given input parameters and expected outcomes.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is related to incorrect handling of the `before` variable in scenarios where previous definitions and decorators impact the insertion of empty lines. The function is not updating the `before` value correctly in those cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
1. Fix the logic for updating the `before` value when handling previous definitions and decorators.
2. Adjust the conditions for determining when to insert empty lines based on the specific scenarios mentioned in the failing test cases.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1 if current_line.depth else 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import()
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        if before == 0:
            before = 1
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield()
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        if before == 0:
            before = 1
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditions and handling the `before` value correctly, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output in each scenario.
