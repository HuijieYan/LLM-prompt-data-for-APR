The buggy function has multiple issues that contribute to incorrect behavior. Here are the identified problems:

1. In the `is_import` function, the check `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrectly referring to `self` instead of the `current_line` parameter.
2. In the main function `_maybe_empty_lines`, the logic for handling decorators is flawed. The check for `is_decorator` is made before checking for the validity of `self.previous_line`, leading to incorrect return values.
3. The handling of `self.previous_defs` is not consistent and may lead to incorrect empty line insertions.

To address these issues, we will make the following adjustments:

1. Fix the reference to `current_line` in the `is_import` function.
2. Reorder the conditions related to decorators and adjust the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert correctly.
3. Update the handling of `self.previous_defs` to ensure proper tracking of previous definitions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        if not self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_import:
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
            and not current_line.is_import
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

    if current_line.is_yield and (
        not self.previous_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the cases correctly as outlined in the test scenarios provided.
