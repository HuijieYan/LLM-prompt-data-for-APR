### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines that need to be inserted before the current line in a given context. Based on various conditions like line depth, presence of leaves, flow control status, import status, yield status, etc., the function calculates the number of empty lines to be inserted. 

### Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the logic for handling `before` and `self.previous_defs` in certain conditions. Specifically, the bug occurs when updating the `before` value while popping elements from `self.previous_defs` list. The logic inside the while loop is updating the `before` value to `1` if `depth` is not equal to `1`. However, this logic is incorrect and doesn't account for the current depth value. 

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the while loop where `before` is updated based on the depth value. The correct approach would be to update `before` to the specific value based on the current `depth` in each iteration.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        # Update before based on the current depth value
        if depth == 0:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### By correcting the logic inside the while loop to update `before` based on the current `depth` value, the function should now correctly handle the cases provided and pass the failing test.
