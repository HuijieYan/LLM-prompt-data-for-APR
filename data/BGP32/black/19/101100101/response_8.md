### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle certain cases related to managing empty lines in code formatting. It checks various conditions based on the input `current_line` and the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. However, there are a few bugs in the function that need to be addressed.

### Bug
The bug lies in the handling of the `is_import` attribute for `current_line` and `self.previous_line`. The function checks if `self.previous_line.is_import` is True, but it should be calling the `is_import` function since `is_import` is a function and not an attribute of `Line`. This mistake causes the function to fail the test cases that rely on this condition for correct output.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly check if the `self.previous_line` and `current_line` are imports by calling the `is_import` function. This change will allow the function to correctly handle cases based on the import status of the lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
         and is_import(self.previous_line)
         and not is_import(current_line)
         and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the correction in the `if` condition that checks for imports, the function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle the insertion of empty lines in the specified scenarios.
