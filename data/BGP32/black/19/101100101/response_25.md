The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the conditions and logic used to determine the number of empty lines to return. The function is not handling some cases correctly, leading to unexpected results.

The bug can be seen in the conditions where it checks for `is_import`, `is_yield`, and others. The issue is specifically with how these conditions are evaluated and what values are returned based on them.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle each case and return the expected number of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n") if first_leaf.prefix else 0
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.is_import(self.previous_line) and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now handle all the cases mentioned in the test scenarios and provide the expected number of empty lines based on the input `current_line` attributes.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test to verify its functionality.
