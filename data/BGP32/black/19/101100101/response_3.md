The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has some logical issues that need to be addressed to fix the bugs. Here is a summary of the identified issues and the proposed fix:

### Issues:
1. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:` is checking if the previous line is a decorator, instead of checking if the current line is a decorator. This condition should be updated to reflect the correct logic.
2. In the case where `current_line.is_decorator` is true, the function should add the current line's depth to `self.previous_defs` to track the previous definitions correctly. The current implementation misses this step.
3. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` attempts to check if the previous line is an import by calling `is_import`. Instead, it should call the `is_import` function from the related functions and not directly on the `Message` object. 

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition related to decorators to check the current line's properties.
2. Add the current line's depth to `self.previous_defs` when the current line is a decorator.
3. Call the `is_import` function correctly to check if the previous line is an import.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if current_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Call the is_import function to correctly check if the previous line is an import
    if self.previous_line and is_import(self.previous_line):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By applying the suggested fixes above, the `maybe_empty_line` function should now correctly handle the conditions and pass the failing test cases provided.
