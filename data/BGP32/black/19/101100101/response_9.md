### Analysis
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. It takes the current line object and some internal state variables as input.
2. The function uses conditions to check various properties of the current line and the previous line to decide the number of empty lines to insert.
3. The function seems to have an issue with the conditions related to decorators, imports, and yields, as they are not handled correctly.
4. The `is_decorator`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` attributes are not directly present in the `Line` class. Instead, there are separate functions such as `is_decorator` that are used to determine these attributes.
5. It's essential to make sure that the conditions properly handle these cases and accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function checks if `self.previous_line.is_import` to determine if the previous line was an import. However, `is_import` is not a direct attribute of the `Line` class. It should call the `is_import` function instead.
2. The condition `and not current_line.is_import` should be replaced with `and not is_import(current_line)` to correctly handle this case and determine the number of empty lines to insert.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the lines related to the import check. We should call the `is_import` function to determine if the current line is an import correctly. Additionally, the condition `and not current_line.is_import` should be replaced with `and not is_import(current_line)` to ensure the correct behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle imports and other conditions, ensuring that the expected number of empty lines is inserted based on the given inputs.
