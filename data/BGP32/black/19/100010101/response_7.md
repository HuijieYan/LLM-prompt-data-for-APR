The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from handling the `before` variable incorrectly. The function needs to allow multiple line breaks when `before` is updated within the while loop context.

The cause of the bug is that the `before` variable is not properly updated inside the while loop. It should allow for multiple line breaks to be counted and not reset back to 1 or 2 each time in the loop.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `before` variable inside the while loop to accumulate the count of line breaks correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = max(1, before)
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return max(1, before), 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version incorporates the suggested changes to properly handle the `before` variable within the while loop, allowing for accumulation of line breaks counts. This should fix the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output values for all cases.
