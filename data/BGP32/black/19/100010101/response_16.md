### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to handle logic related to inserting empty lines in Python code formatting.
2. The function relies on conditions based on properties of the `current_line` object passed as input.
3. The bug seems to be related to the manipulation of `before` and `newlines` variables, which control the number of empty lines to insert.
4. The function should return a tuple containing two integers: the number of newlines to be added before the current line, and whether a newline should be added after the current line.
5. The bug could potentially lead to incorrect empty line insertions in specific scenarios, resulting in failing tests.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided buggy function:
- The variable `before` is incorrectly reassigned inside the while loop, which may lead to incorrect values.
- The calculation of `before` in the `while` loop is not directly related to the logic after this block, potentially causing discrepancies in output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `before` variable maintains consistent value updates based on the requirements of the code formatting.
2. Verify the flow control conditions and adjustments of `before` along with `newlines` to accurately determine the amount of empty lines to be added based on different scenarios.
3. Make sure to maintain the expected behavior for empty line insertion before and after specific line types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 1
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By following these fixes, the corrected function should now properly calculate and return the expected number of empty lines based on the given scenarios. This updated version aims to resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
