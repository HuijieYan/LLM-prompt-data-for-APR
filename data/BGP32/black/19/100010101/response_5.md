### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic where the function determines the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The bug seems to be related to the manipulation of the `before` variable and the handling of different cases based on the properties of the `current_line`.

In the code snippet:
```python
while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
    self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2
```
The `before` variable is being overwritten in the `while` loop, which seems to be intended to update `before` based on different conditions. However, a constant value is used each time (`1 if depth else 2`), which causes incorrect values to be assigned to `before`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain a backup of the original `before` value before entering the `while` loop to correctly handle different cases without overwriting the variable each time.
2. Update the `before` value based on specific conditions within the loop, as intended.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    before_backup = before  # Backup the original before value
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = before_backup  # Restore the original before value
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By maintaining the original value of `before` in the `before_backup` variable and using it to restore the correct value when needed, the corrected code should now handle the different cases correctly and pass the failing test cases.
