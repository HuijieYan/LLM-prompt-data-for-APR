The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has several issues that need to be addressed for it to work correctly. The main problem is in the logic of handling `before` variable which should determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The function should correctly evaluate the conditions based on the `current_line` and `self.previous_line`.

The cause of the bug is that the `before` variable is being overwritten in several places without checking previous values. This leads to incorrect values for `before` in the subsequent steps of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is properly maintained and updated based on each condition. This can be achieved by updating the `before` variable only when necessary and keeping track of the previous value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file
    if self.previous_line is None:
        return 0, 0

    # Don't insert empty lines between decorators
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
        return 0, 0

    newlines = 2
    if current_line.depth:
        newlines -= 1

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified and pass the failing test cases for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
