The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how the `before` variable is updated within the while loop using `self.previous_defs`. 

### Bug Analysis:
- The function is supposed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on various conditions.
- The `before` variable is incorrectly updated inside the while loop which is causing unexpected behavior.
- The issue occurs when the `self.previous_defs` is not empty and the loop starts popping elements from it. The value of `before` is set to `1` if `depth` is `True`, otherwise it is set to `2`.
- This behavior is not always correct based on the case-specific input parameters.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should update the value of `before` outside of the while loop, considering the conditions based on `depth`. We should only update `before` to `1` when the loop condition is met and `depth` is non-zero. Otherwise, `before` should be set to `2`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Update the value of before based on depth before the while loop
    if depth:
        before = 1
    else:
        before = 2
        
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```
By updating the `before` variable correctly based on the depth condition before entering the while loop, the corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
