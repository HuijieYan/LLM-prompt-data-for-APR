The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug that causes incorrect output values leading to failing test cases. The bug lies in the `while` loop where the `before` variable is mistakenly updated within the loop, causing incorrect assignments and potential errors.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect logic applied when updating the `before` variable inside the `while` loop. The assignment `before = 1 if depth else 2` is disrupting the expected behavior and causing the function to return wrong results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable update within the loop does not overwrite the expected value determined outside the loop. By moving the statement `before = 1 if depth else 2` outside the loop, we can maintain the correct value for `before`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    before_in_loop = 1 if depth else 2  # save the value for the while loop
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = before_in_loop
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should pass all the failing test cases and return the expected results for each input scenario.
