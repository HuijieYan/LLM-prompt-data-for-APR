The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the incorrect handling of the `before` variable. The function incorrectly updates `before` inside the while loop, leading to unexpected behavior. The function should preserve the original value of `before` when there is no change needed.

To fix the bug, we need to maintain the original value of `before` when it does not need to be changed. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the conditions for each line type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return min(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return min(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue with the `before` variable and includes the necessary conditions for handling different types of lines. It should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
