The issue in the provided function seems to be related to the conditions and assignments within the function leading to incorrect return values. Here are the identified problems and a strategy for fixing the bug:

### Identified Issues:
1. The `max_allowed` value is set to `2` when `current_line.depth` is `0`, but it should only be set to `2` if `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`.
2. The logic for setting `newlines` does not seem correct.
3. The condition for not inserting empty lines before the first line in the file seems to be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Set `max_allowed = 2` only when `current_line.is_decorator` is `True`.
2. Adjust the logic for setting `newlines` based on the conditions provided.
3. Update the condition for not inserting empty lines before the first line in the file.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0 and current_line.is_decorator:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and \
            depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or \
            depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the cases and provide the expected return values for each scenario.
