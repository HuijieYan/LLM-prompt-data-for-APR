The bug in the provided function is related to the logic for handling empty lines based on certain conditions. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is supposed to determine the number of empty lines before the current line based on different criteria related to the structure of the code.

The error messages indicate that the function is not properly handling the insertion of empty lines before specific types of lines in the code. This leads to incorrect formatting of the code output, causing the test assertions to fail.

To resolve the bug, we need to make sure that the conditions for inserting empty lines are correctly evaluated and returned by the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function handles cases where empty lines need to be inserted before certain lines like decorators, imports, and yield statements.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if depth else 1
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        if not self.previous_line or not self.previous_line.is_def:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        return 2 if depth else 1, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import:
        if not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield:
        if not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the function according to the expected behavior and input/output values, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
