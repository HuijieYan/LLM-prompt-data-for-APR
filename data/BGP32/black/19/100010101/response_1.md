The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine whether to insert empty lines between code lines based on certain conditions. The current implementation has a bug that causes incorrect behavior when handling different scenarios, leading to failing test cases.

### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function tries to handle the cases where empty lines need to be inserted based on the current line characteristics and the previous lines. The issue is mainly related to how `before` variable is calculated and updated in different scenarios. Additionally, the conditions for determining the number of newlines to insert are not properly structured.

### Bug Location:
The bug appears when calculating the `before` variable within the while loop where previous definitions are checked and popped. The logic within the if conditions for decorators is also contributing to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the `before` variable, especially in scenarios where decorators, imports, or yield statements are involved. The logic flow for determining the number of newlines is not properly structured, leading to unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise how the `before` variable is updated and calculate the number of newlines accurately based on the given conditions. Additionally, we need to ensure that the flow control and import cases are handled correctly to maintain the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix and Code Correction: 
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if depth <= 1 and self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 2 if depth == 0 else 1
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the given scenarios and pass the failing test cases while meeting the expected input/output values outlined.
