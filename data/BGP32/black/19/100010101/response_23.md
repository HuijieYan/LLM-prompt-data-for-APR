The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has a bug in the logic when determining the number of empty lines to insert before a given line. The issue arises when handling decorators and defining blocks, causing incorrect behavior and failing the test cases provided.

### Bug Explanation:
- When handling decorators or defining blocks, the function fails to correctly manage the number of expected empty lines to be inserted.
- The conditions for determining empty lines before decorators and defining blocks are not properly set, leading to incorrect results and assertion errors in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the function to properly handle the insertion of empty lines before decorators and defining blocks.
- Ensure the correct number of empty lines based on the nature of the line being processed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By incorporating the corrections above, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle empty line insertion correctly before decorators and defining blocks, passing the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output values.
