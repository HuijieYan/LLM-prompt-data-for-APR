The buggy function is designed to handle scenarios where empty lines should be added based on certain conditions, such as indentation level, line content, and context.

The cause of the bug is in the calculation of the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line. In several scenarios, the implementation does not correctly determine the number of empty lines to insert, leading to incorrect output compared to the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure the correct number of empty lines are inserted based on the provided conditions and context in each case. We need to handle each condition separately and adjust the number of empty lines to be added accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple

def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if not self.previous_line:
        return 0, 0
    
    if self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the conditions for adding empty lines before and after the current line, ensuring that the expected output matches the conditions. It should satisfy all the expected input/output values for each case.
