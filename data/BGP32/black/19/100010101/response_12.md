The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to handle the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added before the current line, based on various conditions related to the line type, depth, and previous lines. 

There is a bug related to the updating of the `before` variable inside the while loop. The bug lies in the fact that the `before` value should be set based on the maximum allowed value `max_allowed` in each iteration of the loop rather than setting it directly to 1 if the `depth` condition is met. This causes an incorrect value for the `before` variable, which leads to incorrect empty line insertion.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to set the `before` value based on the `max_allowed` value inside the loop each time.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = min(1, max_allowed)  # Update before value based on max_allowed
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable is properly updated based on the `max_allowed` value inside the while loop which fixes the bug causing incorrect behavior.
