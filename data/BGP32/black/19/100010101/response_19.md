The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has an issue related to the calculation of the number of empty lines before a line. The `before` variable is being reset to `1` or `2` in a while loop, which is not the intended behavior.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `before` variable is being incorrectly updated to `1` or `2` in the while loop inside the function. This leads to incorrect calculations of the number of empty lines before a line.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should initialize the `newlines` variable to `0` at the beginning and then correctly update the `before` variable to count the number of newlines before the current line.

#### Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 0
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines before a given line, passing all the test cases and satisfying the expected input/output values.
