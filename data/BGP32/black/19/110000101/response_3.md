### Analysis
- The function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the current line.
- The function contains multiple conditional statements based on the properties of the `current_line` and previous lines.
- The function seems to have a mix of conditions that might not always produce the correct output based on the expected cases provided.
- The main issue seems to be with the handling of line prefixes and determining the correct number of empty lines to return.

### Bug Explanation
- The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has multiple conditional statements that modify the `before` variable based on certain conditions within the input `current_line`.
- The issue arises from the inconsistent handling of the `before` variable as it gets updated within different conditional blocks. This inconsistency can lead to incorrect results being returned by the function.
- In some cases, the `before` variable is updated correctly, but in other cases, it is being overwritten based on wrong conditions, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly updated based on the conditions provided in the expected cases.
- Ensure that each condition updates the `before` variable accurately without overwriting it when unnecessary.
- Make sure to handle the different cases of `current_line` properties and adjust the logic accordingly to get the expected output for each case.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the changes as highlighted above, the corrected function should now provide the expected output for the given test cases.
