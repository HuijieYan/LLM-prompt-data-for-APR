The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` has some issues that need to be addressed:
1. The variable `self.previous_line` is not properly initialized in the `EmptyLineTracker` data class which can lead to NoneType errors.
2. The logic to update the `before` variable seems to be incorrect in some cases.
3. The conditions for returning the number of empty lines seem to be missing or incorrect in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.previous_line` is initialized correctly and add missing conditions for returning the correct number of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    self.previous_line = current_line  # Update previous_line here

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version ensures `self.previous_line` is properly updated and correct number of empty lines are considered based on the conditions provided in the function.
