Based on the analysis of the buggy function and expected input/output values, the cause of the bug is that the logic in the function is not correctly updating the `before` variable based on the conditions provided. The function is not properly handling the cases where a line contains decorators, definitions, classes, flow control statements, imports, or yields.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to properly calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on the conditions provided in each case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        if self.previous_defs[-1] == depth:
            before = 1
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function considers all the cases provided in the expected values and updates the `before` variable correctly based on the conditions. It should now meet the expected input/output values for all the test cases.
