Based on the analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the `EmptyLineTracker` class, the primary issue seems to be with the logic for computing the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly calculating the values for `newlines` and is not updating the stateful variables `previous_defs` and `previous_line` properly in certain conditions, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The logic for updating the `previous_defs` list is incorrect, leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels.
2. The conditions for returning the number of newlines are not properly implemented, causing unexpected behavior in line spacing.
3. The handling of different line types (decorators, definitions, etc.) is inconsistent, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for updating `previous_defs` list based on the depth of the current line.
2. Refine the conditions for determining the number of newlines before and after the current line.
3. Ensure consistent handling of different line types to maintain correct spacing and formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth > 0 else 2
    
    before = 0
    first_leaf = None
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""

    depth = current_line.depth

    if depth <= 0:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        self.previous_defs.append(depth)

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth > 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, before), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, before), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues identified and should now provide the expected results for all the test cases provided. Make sure to update the function in your `EmptyLineTracker` class.
