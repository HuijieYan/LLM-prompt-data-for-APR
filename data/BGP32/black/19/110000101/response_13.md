### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the logic for updating the `before` variable when popping previous definitions. When popping previous definitions, the code sets `before` to either 1 or 2 based on the `depth` value. However, in some cases where `depth` is truthy, the code should set `before` to 2 instead of 1. This discrepancy causes incorrect results when determining how many empty lines to insert before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic that modifies the `before` variable when popping previous definitions. Specifically, when `depth` is truthy, we should set `before` to 2 instead of 1. This adjustment ensures that the correct number of empty lines is inserted before the current line.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

The corrected version of the function addresses the issue with the `before` variable not updating correctly when popping previous definitions, ensuring the correct behavior based on the input parameters and expected output values in all test cases.
