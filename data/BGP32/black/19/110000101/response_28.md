Based on the analysis of the buggy function and expected input/output values, the bug occurs when determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the current line based on certain conditions. The buggy function fails to correctly calculate the number of newlines needed in various scenarios, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to handle each case properly and return the correct number of newlines before and after the current line. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions and that the correct number of newlines is returned for each scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues in the original function and ensures that the correct number of empty lines is returned based on the input conditions provided in the buggy class. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
