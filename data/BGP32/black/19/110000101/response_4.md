### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It takes the current line, analyzes its properties, and returns the appropriate number of empty lines.

#### Bug:
The bug in the function lies in the logic flow for handling the `self.previous_defs`. In the while loop, it currently resets the `before` variable to `1` if `depth` is zero, which is not aligned with the expected behavior. This causes incorrect output in some cases, leading to potential extra empty lines being wrongly calculated.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, the logic inside the while loop that updates the `before` variable needs to be modified. Instead of always setting `before` to `1` if `depth` is zero, we should only set it to `1` if the `depth` is non-zero. This aligns with the expected behavior and corrects the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else before
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the logic in the while loop as suggested above, the corrected version of the function should now output the expected values for all the provided test cases.
