The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises due to the incorrect handling of the `before` variable during the evaluation of conditions. The `before` variable is being reassigned inside the loop, but it should not exceed the initial value obtained from `first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")`.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `before` variable remains unchanged after its initial calculation. We can achieve this by introducing a new variable to store the initial value of `before` and use it inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before_initial = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before_initial, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    # Store the initial value of before to prevent reassignment
    before_initial = before
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before_initial, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before_initial or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before_initial or 1), 0

    return before_initial, 0
```

This corrected version ensures that the `before` variable maintains its initial value and prevents unexpected reassignment within the function.
