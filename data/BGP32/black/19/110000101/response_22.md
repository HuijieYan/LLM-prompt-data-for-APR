### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues that lead to incorrect behavior:
1. The `max_allowed` variable is set to `1` initially but should be set to `2` when `current_line.depth` is `0`. This is correct according to the expected cases.
2. The manipulation of `before` variable (number of extra newlines before the current line) is incorrect. The intention is to update it based on certain conditions, but the logic inside the loop is incorrect as it repeatedly updates `before` without considering the initial value.
3. In cases where certain conditions are met (like checking if the current line is a decorator, a flow control statement, or an import statement), the function should return specific values for extra newlines before and after the line. However, due to incorrect logic, these conditions are not handled properly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the function `_maybe_empty_lines`, we need to ensure that:
- `max_allowed` is correctly set based on the value of `current_line.depth`.
- Update the `before` variable computation to properly handle different scenarios and conditions.
- Handle the special cases where specific return values are expected based on the type and characteristics of the current line.

### Corrected Function
```python
# Import dataclass from the necessary library
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker():

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        before = 0  # Initialize before variable
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the input parameters correctly and return the expected results for all the cases provided.
