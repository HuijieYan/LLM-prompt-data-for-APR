### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the correct number of empty lines.

The bug in the function is likely related to the handling of `before` variable, which is used to calculate the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. While the function logic seems to cover different scenarios based on the type of line being processed, the assignment of `before` in certain conditions might be incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug:
The bug can be identified where the `before` variable is reassigned within the function. Particularly, when `self.previous_defs` has elements and it enters the `while` loop to pop elements from it and update the `before` variable, it might not correctly reset the `before` based on the depth condition. The wrong assignment of `before` in this scenario can lead to incorrect results for determining the number of empty lines before the current line.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, a better strategy would be to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly within the `while` loop and that the depth condition is properly considered to set the appropriate number of empty lines. Additionally, it's important to handle all conditions related to different line types to determine the correct number of empty lines.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs:
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            popped_depth = self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if popped_depth == 0 else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version takes care to correctly update the `before` variable within the `while` loop and handles various conditions related to different line types for determining the number of empty lines. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values for the function.
