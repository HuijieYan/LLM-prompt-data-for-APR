### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when trying to maintain and update the `before` variable within the function. The issue arises from incorrectly updating the `before` variable in each conditional block. This leads to incorrect values being assigned to `before` based on specific conditions, causing unexpected behavior in determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is updated correctly based on the conditions provided in the function. We should maintain the initial value of `before` when certain conditions are not met and update it appropriately only when the conditions require it. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

### Changes Made
- Updated the logic for updating the `before` variable in the function.
- Ensured that `before` is appropriately set based on the conditions provided in the function.
- Corrected the handling of the `previous_defs` list to maintain the correct depth values.
