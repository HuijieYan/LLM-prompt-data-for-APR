Based on the buggy function provided and the expected input/output values, the bug seems to be related to the logic for determining the number of empty lines required before and after the currently processed line. The bug likely arises from incorrect handling of the `before` variable, which should track the number of empty lines before the current line. 

To fix the bug, we need to make adjustments in the logic related to updating the `before` variable based on specific conditions in the code. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `max_allowed` value is correctly determined and taken into consideration during the calculations.

Here is the corrected version of the function considering the expected input/output values:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line):
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        before = 0
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        
        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            before = 1 if depth else 2
            self.previous_defs.pop()
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            
            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                return 0, 0
            
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
        
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return before or 1, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return before or 1, 0
        
        return before, 0
```

Make sure to test the function with all the provided cases to ensure that it now produces the expected output for each scenario. If there are any further issues or discrepancies, additional adjustments may be necessary.
