### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. In the current implementation, the function is not handling the case where `before` should be calculated based on `self.previous_defs` when `is_decorator` is True. This leads to incorrect results when determining the number of empty lines before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to properly calculate the `before` variable based on the conditions specified. Specifically, we need to check the value of `is_decorator` and include the handling of `self.previous_defs` when necessary.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now handle the cases correctly and satisfy all the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
