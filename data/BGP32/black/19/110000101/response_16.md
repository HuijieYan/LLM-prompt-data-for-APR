### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is intended to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior.

1. The logic for handling `self.previous_defs` list is incorrect. The function updates the `before` variable based on the depth of the current line and removes elements from the `previous_defs` list without correctly updating the `before` variable. This leads to incorrect values being returned.

2. The condition for returning `newlines, 0` when the current line is a decorator or a def-class block is not handling the case where `current_line.is_decorator` is false and `self.previous_line` is None. This condition should return `(0, 0)` in this case.

3. The condition for returning `newlines, 0` when the current line has `is_flow_control` set to true is missing a check for the `depth` attribute of the current line. It should subtract 1 from `newlines` when `depth` is non-zero.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Fix the logic for `self.previous_defs` handling to correctly update the `before` variable.
2. Update the condition for returning `(0, 0)` when `current_line.is_decorator` is false and `self.previous_line` is None.
3. Correct the condition for returning `(before, 1)` when `current_line.is_flow_control` is true to subtract 1 from `newlines` when `depth` is non-zero.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
