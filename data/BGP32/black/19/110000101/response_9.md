Based on the expected input/output values and the buggy function provided, it seems like the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the logic to determine the number of potential extra empty lines before and after the current line.

The bug seems to be in the logic for determining the number of empty lines before the current line. The `before` variable is updated within the loop based on the condition `before = 1 if depth else 2`, where `before` is being overwritten instead of incremented. This causes incorrect behavior in cases where the `depth` is not zero.

To fix this bug, we need to increment the `before` variable instead of overwriting it. Additionally, we should adjust the logic in the loop to correctly update the `before` value based on the condition specified in the expected values for each case.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before += 1 if depth else 2  # Increment before based on depth
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version should now handle the logic for calculating the correct number of empty lines before the current line based on the specified conditions for each case.
