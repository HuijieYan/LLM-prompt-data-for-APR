## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function occurs when deciding how many newlines to insert between lines. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` is used to prevent the insertion of empty lines between decorators. However, this condition does not properly handle the case where decorators are followed by comments. This leads to incorrect insertion of newlines and subsequently produces a mismatch in the expected and actual output, causing the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition that checks for decorators while inserting newlines. Instead of solely checking if the previous line is a decorator, we should also consider cases where the previous line ends with a comment. By doing so, we can ensure that empty lines are correctly inserted between decorators with comments.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or self.previous_line.leaves[-1].type in Comment):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators or if the previous line ends with a comment.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By updating the condition to include the check for the last leaf type being a comment in addition to checking for decorators, the corrected function ensures that empty lines are correctly handled between decorators and preceding comments. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test scenario.
