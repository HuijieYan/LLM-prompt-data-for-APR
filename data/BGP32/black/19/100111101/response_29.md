### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling the `before` variable. In particular, when calculating the value for `before`, the function incorrectly assigns the value based on conditions within the `while` loop, overwriting the previous value. This results in the incorrect calculation of empty lines before specific lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is correctly determined based on the conditions at each stage and that the value is not overwritten incorrectly during the processing of the current line and the previous line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
        not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
        (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the `before` variable calculation and ensuring it is not overwritten incorrectly, the function should now accurately determine the number of empty lines to insert before lines based on the defined conditions. The corrected version should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
