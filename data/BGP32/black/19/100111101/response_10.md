The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before the current line is flawed, leading to incorrect results. The function is not properly handling cases involving decorators, imports, and yield statements.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly determine the number of empty lines based on different scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0
    
    return 0, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified in the original function and should now pass the failing test cases.
