### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to arise from incorrectly updating the `before` variable within the loop that iterates over `self.previous_defs`. The issue can be identified where after updating `before` with 1 or 2, it should only be assigned if `before` is less than 1, but that's not the case. This leads to incorrect behavior when determining the number of empty lines before the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, ensure that the logic for assigning the `before` variable within the `while` loop correctly checks if it should update the value based on the current `before` value.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By applying these adjustments, the logic for updating the `before` variable within the `while` loop should now accurately reflect the requirements and address the bug's root cause.
