The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to how the `before` variable is handled and updated. Depending on different conditions, `before` is re-assigned a new value without considering the previous value. This can lead to incorrect calculations in subsequent parts of the function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `before` variable is properly updated based on different conditions without losing the initially calculated value. Here is a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    # Update max_allowed based on current_line.depth
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    # Update 'before' based on previous_defs
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        popped_depth = self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if popped_depth == depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `before` variable is updated and maintained correctly throughout the function execution based on different conditions. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected in all scenarios.
