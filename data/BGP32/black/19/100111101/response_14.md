The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic handling the number of newlines to be returned under different conditions. The function incorrectly calculates the number of newlines to be inserted in certain cases, leading to the failing test.

In the failing test, the assertFormatEqual assertion fails due to incorrect newlines between comments. To fix this issue, the logic for calculating the number of newlines needs to be corrected. Specifically, the cases with decorators and imports seem to be causing the problem.

To address this issue, we need to adjust the newlines calculation for decorators and imports based on the expected behavior indicated in the failing test and the buggy function analysis.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth != 0 else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and not current_line.is_yield:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic for calculating newlines in the relevant cases and correcting the handling of decorators and imports, the function should now pass the failing test scenario.
