### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic concerning the insertion of empty lines in specific cases. The function is not correctly handling some scenarios leading to the incorrect output, causing the failing test. 

1. In Case 1, when `current_line` is a decorator, the function should not insert empty lines before the first line in the file. However, the current implementation does not account for this condition and returns `0, 0`, which is incorrect.

2. In Cases 2, 3, 4, and 5, the function is not correctly handling the scenario where the previous line is a decorator. It should not insert empty lines between decorators, but it does not consider this condition, leading to incorrect output.

3. In Case 6, even when `current_line` is a flow control statement, the function should not return `before, 1`. Instead, it should return `(before or 1), 0`, handling the cases where `before` is assigned a value based on certain conditions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to correct the logic to handle the insertion of empty lines correctly in the scenarios described above. Specifically:
- Ensure not to insert empty lines before the first line in the file when the current line is a decorator.
- Prevent inserting empty lines between decorators.
- Properly handle the case of flow control statements to return the correct values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        if depth:
            before = 2
        else:
            before = 1
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By fixing the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as mentioned above, the function should now handle the insertion of empty lines correctly in the specified scenarios, ensuring that the failing test cases pass successfully.
