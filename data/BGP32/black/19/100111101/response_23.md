## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to the handling of empty lines before certain types of code constructs such as decorators. The function incorrectly calculates the number of empty lines that should be inserted before or after a line based on the presence of decorators, imports, flow control statements, and yields.

### Issues:
1. Overriding the `before` variable: The value of the `before` variable is being overwritten inside the `while` loop for setting previous definitions, which leads to incorrect calculation of the number of empty lines.
2. Incorrect empty line insertion logic: The function returns wrong values for the number of empty lines to insert before and after a line, particularly when dealing with decorators, imports, and yields.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Remove the code that redundantly sets the `before` variable inside the `while` loop to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is determined.
2. Adjust the logic to properly handle situations involving decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements to calculate the required number of empty lines accurately.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By making the above fixes and adjustments to the logic, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now correctly calculate the number of empty lines to insert before and after different types of code constructs, leading to passing the failing test cases.
