### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is related to calculating the number of newlines to insert before the current line. The logic to determine the number of newlines is faulty in multiple scenarios, leading to incorrect results.

1. When a line is a decorator, class, or function definition, the function fails to correctly handle the insertion of empty lines before these lines. It sometimes misses the requirement to add an empty line or incorrectly inserts additional newlines.

2. The function incorrectly handles certain special cases like imports or yields, leading to incorrect newline insertions before these lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revisit the logic in `_maybe_empty_lines` and ensure that the correct number of newlines are inserted based on the type of line and its context. We should address the issues in the handling of decorators, function definitions, and other special cases to align with the expected behavior of formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that addresses the identified issues.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class
    if is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the insertion of empty lines before different types of lines based on the context and expected behavior. It should align with the expected input/output values and pass the failing tests.
