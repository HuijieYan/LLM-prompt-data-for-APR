The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is that the logic for determining the number of newlines to insert is incorrect in some cases. Specifically, when dealing with decorators, imports, and yields, the function returns incorrect values. Additionally, there may be issues with handling comment lines within decorators.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the cases where empty lines need to be inserted or skipped based on the current line context.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 - current_line.depth
        if newlines < 0:
            newlines = 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and (self.previous_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_decorator)
        ):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators or after decorators.
            return 0, 0

        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before, 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the condition checks and return values for various cases within the function, the corrected version should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
