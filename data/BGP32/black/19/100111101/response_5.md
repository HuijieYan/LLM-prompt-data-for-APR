### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the handling of newlines in certain conditions. The function calculates the number of empty lines to insert before the current line based on different criteria such as the type of the current line, depth, and previous lines.

Upon analysis of the failing test and runtime input/output values, it appears that the function is not handling certain cases correctly. The expected output values suggest that the function is not returning the correct number of empty lines in some scenarios, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

#### Issues Identified:
1. The function does not properly handle the case where the current line is a decorator or a class or function definition, leading to incorrect calculation of empty lines to be inserted.
2. In certain conditions related to imports and yields, the function does not correctly calculate the number of empty lines, causing discrepancies between expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issues identified, the following strategies can be used:
1. Update the logic within the function to correctly handle decorator, def, and class lines to determine the correct number of empty lines to be inserted.
2. Ensure that the conditions related to imports and yields are properly checked and the appropriate number of empty lines are returned based on those conditions.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        return 2 if current_line.depth else 1, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return 1, 0

    return 0, 0
```

By updating the conditional logic in the function, the corrected version should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test scenarios.
