The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises due to improper handling of newlines before certain tokens. Specifically, there was an issue where the optional newlines were not correctly calculated based on the context of the current line and previous lines, resulting in incorrect formatting.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines the number of newlines to insert before the current line. In the provided code, there are various conditions that need to be checked to ensure proper formatting, especially related to decorators, imports, yields, and flow control statements.

Here's a corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines = 1
        else:
            newlines = 2
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return 0, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(1, self.previous_line.count_newlines()), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(1, self.previous_line.count_newlines()), 0

    return 0, 0
```

In this corrected version, we have adjusted the conditions for adding empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous lines. This should resolve the formatting issues and ensure that the function passes the failing test.
