### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where the logic for handling empty lines before specific line types or conditions is incorrect. The function aims to determine the number of empty lines to insert before a given line based on certain criteria. 

One issue arises from the handling of `before` variable. The `before` variable is correctly calculated based on the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf. However, this value is then overwritten by 1 or 2 in certain conditions, which leads to incorrect behavior.

Another issue is with the logic involving `self.previous_defs`, which is intended to store the depth of previous definitions. In some cases, this list should be appended with the current depth, but there are issues with the implementation leading to incorrect behavior.

Lastly, the logic related to determining the number of empty lines to insert is not consistent and leads to incorrect results in specific scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

1. Ensure that the `before` variable retains its initially calculated value unless a specific condition requires it to be set to 1 or 2.

2. Correct the handling of `self.previous_defs` list to correctly append the current depth when necessary.

3. Review and adjust the logic used to determine the number of empty lines to insert based on different line types and conditions to ensure consistent and correct outcomes.

### The corrected version:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
        
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
      
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

With the corrections made, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should now return the correct number of empty lines to insert based on the specified conditions and line types.
