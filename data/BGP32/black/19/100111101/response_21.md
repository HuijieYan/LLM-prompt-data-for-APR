## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function lies in the logic for handling empty lines under specific conditions. The function is designed to manage the insertion of empty lines based on the context of the current line and the previous line. However, the conditions are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

### Identified Issue
1. The conditions for inserting empty lines based on decorators, imports, flow control, and yields are not properly implemented.
2. In certain cases, the function is not correctly updating the `before` variable, leading to incorrect empty line insertions.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to address the identified issues by adjusting the conditions and the logic for updating the `before` variable. By correctly handling these scenarios, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing tests.

## Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function as shown above, the function should now handle the empty line insertion conditions properly, thus passing the failing tests and meeting the expected input/output values.
