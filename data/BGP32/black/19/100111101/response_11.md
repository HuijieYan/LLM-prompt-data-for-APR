## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to determine the number of empty lines to insert before a current line of code based on specific conditions related to indentation level, types of code lines, and line attributes. The function uses a `max_allowed` variable to adjust the number of empty lines to insert, but it has an issue when handling `first_leaf.prefix`. The function attempts to remove the prefix of the first leaf but fails to consider the impact of this action on the overall calculation of empty lines.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises when the function modifies the `first_leaf.prefix` incorrectly by setting it to an empty string. This impacts the calculation of the `before` value, which should represent the number of existing newlines before the first leaf of the current line. By resetting `first_leaf.prefix` to an empty string, the function fails to consider the actual number of newlines present in the prefix, leading to incorrect calculations of empty lines to insert.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the handling of `first_leaf.prefix` to correctly count the number of newlines in the prefix. By preserving the original number of newlines before the first leaf, we can ensure accurate calculations of the `before` value. Additionally, the impact of manipulating the `first_leaf.prefix` on the overall calculation of empty lines should be carefully considered to maintain consistency.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")  # Count the number of newlines in the prefix
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        # Preserve the original prefix including newlines
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correctly counting the number of newlines in the `first_leaf.prefix` and preserving the original prefix, the corrected function should provide accurate calculations of empty lines to insert before the current line of code, addressing the bug that caused the failing test cases.
