### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of when to skip or insert empty lines based on the type of line being analyzed (e.g., decorator, function definition, flow control, etc.). The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has conditional checks to determine the number of empty lines to insert before the current line. The issue appears to occur due to inconsistencies in these checks that lead to incorrect insertion or skipping of empty lines.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the expected and actual output differ due to incorrect handling of comments within decorators. The function erroneously inserts empty lines between decorators. This behavior is not desirable and causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the logic in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should be adjusted to correctly handle the cases when empty lines should be inserted or skipped. Specifically, the condition for not inserting empty lines between decorators needs to be fixed. Additionally, the handling of comments and the depth of the current line may need adjustments to ensure correct behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    insert_empty_lines = 0
    skip_empty_lines = 0

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        insert_empty_lines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            insert_empty_lines -= 1

    elif current_line.is_flow_control:
        skip_empty_lines = before
        skip_empty_lines = 1

    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        skip_empty_lines = 1 if before == 0 else before

    elif (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        skip_empty_lines = 1 if before == 0 else before

    return skip_empty_lines, insert_empty_lines
```

By making these adjustments to the logic in the function, the corrected version should now correctly handle when to insert or skip empty lines, resolving the bug that caused the failing test.
