The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the handling of `before` variable when certain conditions are met. Specifically, the calculation of `before` inside the `while` loop and in the subsequent logic causes unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

To fix this issue, we should ensure that the `before` value is properly updated based on the conditions and that it reflects the correct number of newlines to insert. Additionally, we need to consider the depth and handling of the `previous_defs` list to determine when to insert empty lines correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0
            if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
            return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly update the `before` variable and handling the insertion of empty lines based on conditions, the corrected function ensures that the expected number of empty lines are inserted in the right places, addressing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
