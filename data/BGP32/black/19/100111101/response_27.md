### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for handling cases where empty lines should or should not be inserted based on various conditions related to the current line being processed.

After analyzing the function and the failing test cases, we can identify the following issues:
1. The logic for setting the `before` variable inside the `while` loop after popping `self.previous_defs` is incorrect.
2. The conditions for inserting empty lines in certain cases are not properly checked, leading to unexpected results in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correct the logic for setting the `before` variable inside the `while` loop after popping `self.previous_defs` to handle different depth levels properly.
2. Check and adjust the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the expected behavior specified in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correcting the issues identified and updating the conditions for inserting empty lines, the function should now pass the failing test cases.
