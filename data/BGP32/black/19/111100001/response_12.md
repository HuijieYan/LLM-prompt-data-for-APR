### Analysis:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that is responsible for returning the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The buggy function has several conditional statements based on the properties of the `current_line` object.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison between `self.previous_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_import` where `is_import` is a function called on `self.previous_line` but incorrectly identified as an attribute.

### Bug:
The bug is in the conditional statement:
```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
```
Here, `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrectly referencing a supposed attribute `is_import` of `self.previous_line`, while it should be calling the `is_import` function defined outside the class.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function on `self.previous_line` instead of trying to access it as an attribute.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Call the is_import function on self.previous_line instead of accessing it as an attribute
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this change, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
