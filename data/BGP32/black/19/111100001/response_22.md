### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is checking if the previous line is an import using `self.previous_line.is_import`. However, there is no `is_import` attribute directly on the `Line` class that represents the `current_line`. Instead, there is a function `is_import(leaf)` that can be used to determine if a leaf is an import.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` which is not a valid attribute on the `Line` class. This leads to an AttributeError since the `is_import` function is not being called correctly to check if the current line is an import.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of checking `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should call the `is_import` function passing the appropriate leaf to check if the current line is an import. This will involve modifying the condition where the import check is done.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    is_import_line = any(is_import(leaf) for leaf in current_line.leaves)
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and any(is_import(leaf) for leaf in self.previous_line.leaves)
        and not is_import_line
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the import checks are done by calling the `is_import` function for both the `current_line` and `self.previous_line` to determine if they are import lines or not. This modification ensures the correct behavior of the function and fixes the bug.
