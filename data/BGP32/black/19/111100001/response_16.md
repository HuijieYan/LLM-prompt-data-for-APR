### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function is a method of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function seems to be calculating the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of line types (import, yield, flow control) and the handling of empty lines before the current line.
4. The function calls `is_import()` function from outside the class to check if the current line is an import, but this function is not implemented in the provided code snippet. So, this could potentially be a source of the bug.
5. Another potential issue is with the handling of `self.previous_line` which might also impact the correct calculation of empty lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper comparison of line types and incorrect calculation of empty lines before and after the current line. The usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect because the `is_import` method is not defined within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. As a result, the function encounters an AttributeError when trying to access `is_import`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Implement the `is_import` method within the `EmptyLineTracker` class or update the logic to handle line type comparisons without relying on an external function.
2. Correct the logic for calculating the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on different line types and depth comparisons.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Update the EmptyLineTracker class including the fixed _maybe_empty_lines function

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
            
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import  # Check if the previous line is an import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
``` 

### Note:
- The above correction assumes that the `Line` class and other referenced classes are properly defined in the overall codebase.
- Remember to update the logic for `is_import`, `is_yield`, `is_flow_control`, and any other relevant methods based on the actual implementation in the full codebase.
