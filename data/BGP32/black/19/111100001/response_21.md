### Analysis:
The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines()` that is intended to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug seems to be related to the condition for checking if the current line is an import statement. The function calls `current_line.is_import` which should ideally be `is_import(current_line)` to check if the current line is an import statement.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function where it incorrectly checks `current_line.is_import` instead of invoking the `is_import()` function to check if the current line is an import statement. This causes the function to never correctly identify import statements, leading to incorrect spacing logic.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following portion of the code:
```python
if (
    self.previous_line
    and self.previous_line.is_import
    and not current_line.is_import
    and depth == self.previous_line.depth
):
```

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` should be replaced with a call to the `is_import()` function like `is_import(self.previous_line)`. This change will ensure that the function correctly identifies import statements.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Fixed bug here
        and not is_import(current_line)  # Fixed bug here
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines()` function should now correctly handle import statements and pass the failing test cases.
