### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is trying to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions such as `current_line.depth`, presence of leaves, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` to decide the number of empty lines.
3. The issue seems to be with the condition where it checks if `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import`. The problem lies in the way `is_import` check is being performed. The function `is_import` is being called as an attribute `self.previous_line.is_import`, but it is actually a separate function.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the check for import is done correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly checking `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line` which is not a valid attribute since `is_import` is actually a separate function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the incorrect attribute `is_import` check from the condition where `self.previous_line.is_import` is being checked.
2. Instead, directly call the `is_import` function passing `self.previous_line` as an argument to check if the previous line is an import line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I replaced `self.previous_line.is_import` with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly check if the previous line is an import line using the `is_import` function. This change should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
