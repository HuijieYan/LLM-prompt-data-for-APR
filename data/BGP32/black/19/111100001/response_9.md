## Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison between the `current_line` and `previous_line` attributes in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function uses `is_import` and `is_yield` functions to determine certain conditions, but doesn't handle these properly. Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of empty lines seems to be incorrect in some cases.

## Bug Cause:
1. The function is referencing `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` directly without calling the respective functions `is_import()` and `is_yield()`.
2. The logic for calculating the number of empty lines is not consistent with the conditions being checked.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` with function calls `is_import(self.previous_line)` and `is_yield(self.previous_line)`.
2. Update the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to comply with the conditions being checked.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator():
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not current_line.is_import()
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_yield(self.previous_line)
            and (not current_line.is_yield() or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version should address the bugs and pass the failing test scenario.
