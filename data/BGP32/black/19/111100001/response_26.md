### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. It checks various conditions related to the current line, previous line, depth, decorators, imports, etc. to decide the number of empty lines.
3. The buggy function is failing when trying to check if the previous line is an import by calling `self.previous_line.is_import` but there is no `is_import` attribute or method defined in the `Line` class, causing an AttributeError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to access `is_import` as an attribute of `self.previous_line`, assuming that `Line` class has an `is_import` attribute or method. However, the `is_import` function is available at the module level and needs to be called separately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function from the module level on `self.previous_line` to determine if it is an import line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Update the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call is_import function from module level
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the above correction in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug related to the `is_import` attribute access on `self.previous_line` should be resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test scenario provided.
