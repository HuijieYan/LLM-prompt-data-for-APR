### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function checks various conditions such as line depth, presence of leaves, decorator status, flow control, imports, and yields to decide the number of empty lines.

### Bugs in the Function:
1. The function is checking `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` properties directly on the `current_line` object without calling the appropriate functions. This is causing AttributeError as these properties are not defined directly on the `Line` object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to directly accessing properties `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` on the `current_line` object, which are expected to be invoked through helper functions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Replace the direct property access with method calls to check for import, yield, and decorator status.
2. Ensure to pass the `current_line` object to the appropriate functions (`is_import`, `is_yield`, `is_decorator`) to determine the correct status.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Correct the buggy function _maybe_empty_lines in the EmptyLineTracker class
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = is_decorator(current_line)
    if is_decorator or is_def(current_line) or is_class(current_line):
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and is_decorator(self.previous_line):
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if is_flow_control(current_line):
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_yield(self.previous_line)
        and (not is_yield(current_line) or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the functions `is_import`, `is_yield`, and `is_decorator` are used to check the respective statuses, ensuring correct behavior. This fix should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
