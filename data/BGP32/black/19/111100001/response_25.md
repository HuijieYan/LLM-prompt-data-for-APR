## Analysis:
- The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles conditions for empty lines and imports in the code.
- The function checks for different conditions like decorators, flow control, imports, etc., to determine the number of empty lines needed.
- The issue appears to be with the condition `self.previous_line.is_import`, where `is_import` is expected to be a method of `current_line` but is accessed as a property of `self.previous_line`, which is causing the bug.


## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the `is_import` property of `self.previous_line` which does not exist. In the provided function, `is_import` is a function defined outside of the class, but the code mistakenly tries to access it as a property of the `self.previous_line` object.


## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for imports in the code. Instead of trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import`, we should call the `is_import` function outside the class with the appropriate arguments to determine if the current line is an import.


## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        is_prev_line_import = is_import(self.previous_line) if self.previous_line else False
        is_cur_line_import = is_import(current_line)
        
        if is_prev_line_import and not is_cur_line_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, the bug is addressed by calling the `is_import` function with the appropriate arguments to determine if the current line is an import, instead of directly accessing a property that does not exist.
