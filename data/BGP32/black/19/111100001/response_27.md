### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug seems to be related to the condition checks and logic flow within the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:` seems to affect the flow of the function.
2. The condition `if current_line.is_flow_control:` may also be causing unexpected behavior.
3. The condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` might need to be handled differently.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect condition checks and logic flow within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The comparisons such as `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield` are causing the function to not behave as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Clearly define the conditions and expected behavior for determining empty lines before and after the processed line.
2. Refactor the condition checks and adjust the logic flow to correctly handle different cases.
3. Ensure that the interactions with `self.previous_line` and other attributes are properly handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(current_line.depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line):
        if current_line.depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return (before or 1), 0
    
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or current_line.depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, I made adjustments to the logic flow and condition checks to ensure the function behaves as intended. I also modified the check for `is_import` and `is_yield` to handle the comparisons correctly.
