### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the current line and the previous line to determine the number of empty lines to be inserted.
3. There is a bug in the function related to checking whether the `previous_line` is an import or yield, which causes the failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` to fail.
4. The bug seems to be due to incorrect logic when checking for import and yield conditions.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve correcting the conditions for checking import and yield cases.

### Correction:
```python
# Fixed version of the _maybe_empty_lines function
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Check if the previous line is an import
            and not is_import(current_line)  # Check if the current line is not an import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By making the corrections as shown above, the function should now correctly handle the conditions for checking import and yield cases, fixing the bug that caused the failing test case.
