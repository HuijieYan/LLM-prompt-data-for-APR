### Analysis:
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class has several conditional statements to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after a given line.
2. The function checks various conditions related to the current line, the previous line, depth, decorators, flow control, imports, and yields to determine the appropriate number of empty lines.
3. The bug likely occurs when trying to check if the `current_line.is_import` is truthy, as there is no `is_import` attribute defined within the `Line` class.
4. The function should be updated to properly call the `is_import` function defined outside the class instead of trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function occurs when trying to access `current_line.is_import`, which is not a valid attribute of the `Line` class. The intention was to check if the line is an import by calling the `is_import` function outside the class.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to replace `current_line.is_import` with a call to the `is_import` function to correctly determine if the line is an import.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_import = is_import(current_line)  # Corrected to call is_import function
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import(current_line)
        and not is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By replacing `current_line.is_import` with a function call to `is_import(current_line)` we ensure that the correct behavior is implemented for determining if the current line is an import.
