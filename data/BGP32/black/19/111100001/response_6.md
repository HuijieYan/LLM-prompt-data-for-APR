### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines()` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function makes decisions based on various conditions such as line depth, presence of leaves, line types (import, yield, flow control, etc.), and previous line attributes.

From the code provided, it seems that the bug is related to how the function handles checking if the current line is an import (`current_line.is_import`). This check is done by comparing it with the value returned by the `is_import` function called within the class.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the comparison of `current_line.is_import` with a function `self.previous_line.is_import`. The comparison is incorrect because `self.previous_line.is_import` should be replaced with a direct call to the `is_import` function as the check is intended to determine if the previous line is an import, not the current line.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where previous line attributes are compared. Replace `self.previous_line.is_import` with a function call to `is_import(self.previous_line)`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line) # Corrected comparison here
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
