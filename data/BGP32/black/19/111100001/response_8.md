### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` within the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions based on the properties of the current line and the previous line.
3. The bug occurs when trying to check `is_import` property of the `previous_line` which is a Line object but the function tries to call `is_import` directly which is actually a function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the `previous_line` is of type `Line` and then call the `is_import` function separately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if the `previous_line` is an instance of `Line` before trying to access its properties or methods.
- If `previous_line` is of type `Line`, then call the `is_import` function to check if it is an import line or not.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth
        
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            isinstance(self.previous_line, Line) # Check if previous_line is an instance of Line
            and is_import(self.previous_line) # Call the is_import function separately
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            isinstance(self.previous_line, Line) # Check if previous_line is an instance of Line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
        
        return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the function includes the checks to ensure that `previous_line` is of type `Line` before accessing its properties or calling methods on it. The `is_import` function is now called separately within these checks.
