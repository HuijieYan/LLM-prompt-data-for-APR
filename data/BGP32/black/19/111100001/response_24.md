### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. The issue with the function is that when checking whether the `current_line` is an import or yield, it is incorrectly trying to access the `is_import` and `is_yield` attributes as if they are methods, which they are not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by attempting to call `current_line.is_import` and `current_line.is_yield` as if they were methods, which leads to an AttributeError due to them being treated as attributes.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the conditions checking for import and yield to compare the attributes directly without attempting to call them as methods.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function should now handle the attributes `is_import` and `is_yield` correctly without causing any AttributeError.
