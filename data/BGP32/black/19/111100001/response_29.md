### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is part of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
2. The function calculates the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison with `is_import`, which should be a function call to `is_import` defined outside the class.
4. The buggy function is incorrectly trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function.
5. The failing test is related to handling comments in decorators and may be impacted by the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly checking `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of calling the `is_import` function defined outside the class. This results in a comparison error and the function fails when trying to determine the number of potential empty lines.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Replace the incorrect reference `self.previous_line.is_import` with a function call to `is_import`, which should be imported.
2. Ensure that the `is_import` function is correctly imported and called within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version, `self.previous_line.is_import` has been replaced with `is_import(self.previous_line)` to correctly call the `is_import` function for comparison. This change should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
