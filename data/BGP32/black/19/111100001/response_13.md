### Analysis:
- The `EmptyLineTracker` class has a method `_maybe_empty_lines` that determines the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on certain conditions.
- The function checks various conditions related to the current and previous lines to decide on the number of empty lines.
- There are references to attributes/methods like `depth`, `leaves`, `previous_defs`, `previous_line`, `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield` from the class instance within the function.

### Identified Potential Issues:
1. The function refers to `is_import` as a method of `current_line` but should actually be calling the standalone function `is_import(leaf)`.
2. The logic for determining the number of empty lines based on conditions like import statements, decorators, etc., seems to be incorrect.
3. The logic for processing previous definitions and decorators may need adjustments.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line based on the conditions related to import statements, decorators, and control flow. The incorrect usage of `is_import` method and the flawed logic for handling previous definitions and decorators cause the function to return incorrect values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the reference to `current_line.is_import` to call the standalone function `is_import(leaf)` to correctly check if a leaf is an import statement.
2. Adjust the logic for handling decorators, previous definitions, and other conditions to correctly calculate the number of empty lines required before and after the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The call to `current_line.is_import` has been replaced with `is_import(self.previous_line)` and `is_import(current_line)` to correctly validate import statements.
- The logic for handling decorators, flow control, imports, and yields has been adjusted to ensure correct calculation of empty lines before and after the current line.

By applying these fixes, the function should now provide the correct number of empty lines based on the given conditions.
