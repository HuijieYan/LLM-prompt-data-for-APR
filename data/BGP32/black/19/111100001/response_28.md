### Analysis:
1. The `EmptyLineTracker` class contains a function `_maybe_empty_lines` that calculates potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. The function checks various conditions based on the `current_line` object attributes and the previous lines to determine the number of empty lines to insert before and after the current line.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of attributes on `current_line` and `previous_line`, as well as the conditions for handling imports and yields.
4. The failing test `test_comment_in_decorator` checks the formatting of code containing comments within a decorator and expects the output to match the expected format.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs in the condition `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import` where `is_import` is treated as an attribute of `current_line`.
2. The function does not have a direct reference to the `is_import` function, which should be called as `is_import(self.previous_line)` to check if the previous line is an import.
3. This incorrect check leads to the bug where the correct comparison for imports is not performed, affecting the calculation of empty lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the condition checking for imports uses the `is_import` function correctly by passing `self.previous_line` as an argument to determine if the previous line is an import statement.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
``` 

This corrected version fixes the bug by correctly calling the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` to check if the previous line is an import statement. This modification ensures the correct comparison for imports and addresses the issue in the original function.
