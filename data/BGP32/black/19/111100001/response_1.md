### Analysis:
1. The `_maybe_empty_lines` function in the `EmptyLineTracker` class is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line.
2. There are conditions in the function based on the properties of the `current_line`, like depth, leaves, is_decorator, is_def, is_class, is_flow_control, is_import, and is_yield.
3. The bug seems to be related to the `current_line.is_import` condition, where it is trying to call `self.previous_line.is_import`, which is incorrect as `is_import` is a function, not a property.
4. The buggy function is trying to access the `is_import` property on `self.previous_line`, which should be checking against a function `is_import(leaf)` instead.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` instead of checking the condition using the `is_import` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition related to `current_line.is_import` to compare it with `is_import(leaf)` function instead of trying to access it as a property of `self.previous_line`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0
    
            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0
    
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    
        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Change to call is_import function
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0
    
        return before, 0
```

After applying the fix above, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test case.
