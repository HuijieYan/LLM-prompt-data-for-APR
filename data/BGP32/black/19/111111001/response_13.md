### Bug Analysis
In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug arises when trying to check if the `previous_line` is an import by calling `self.previous_line.is_import`. The problem is that the `is_import` function is not being correctly called due to confusion with the class attribute `is_import`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` expects `is_import` to be a class method of the `Line` class due to the way it's being used (`self.previous_line.is_import`) but actually, it's a separate function (`is_import(leaf: Leaf)`).
   
2. The error occurs because when `self.previous_line.is_import` is called, Python tries to find the method within the `Line` class and does not find it, resulting in an AttributeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to call the `is_import` function correctly from within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. This involves importing the correct functions properly and ensuring that the intended function is called when checking for import lines.

### Update the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where `is_import` is called correctly.

```python
# Updated Function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Correctly call is_import function
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By correctly calling the `is_import` function, we have addressed the bug and the function should now work as intended when checking import lines.
