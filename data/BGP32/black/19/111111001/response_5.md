### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from incorrectly handling conditions related to identifying whether a line is an import, yield, or flow control. The function fails to correctly detect these conditions and set the number of empty lines accordingly, leading to assertion errors in the provided test cases.

1. The function incorrectly checks the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line` object instead of calling the `is_import` function, causing incorrect behavior.
2. The logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the currently processed line is flawed, resulting in discrepancies in the output compared to the expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking related to imports and other line types by calling the `is_import` function. Additionally, we should correct the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on the specific line attributes.

### Buggy Function (Corrected):
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
        
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making the necessary corrections in the function to correctly identify the line types and adjust the number of empty lines, the updated version should now pass the failing test cases.
