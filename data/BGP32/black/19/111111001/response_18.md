### Bug Analysis
In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, the bug seems to be related to the comparison of `current_line.is_import` within the condition block. The error message and the failing test indicate a mismatch in the inserted empty lines when dealing with comments inside decorators.

The issue arises from trying to access the attribute `is_import` directly on the `current_line` instance without calling the corresponding function `is_import` defined in the same file. This results in a `TypeError` when trying to access an attribute that is not present on the `current_line` object.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `is_import` function is invoked correctly to retrieve the boolean value that indicates whether the current line is an import line or not. We need to replace `current_line.is_import` with `is_import(current_line)` to correctly determine if the current line is an import statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this correction in the function and correctly determining if the current line is an import statement using the `is_import` function, we can address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
