### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from the incorrect check for whether the current line is flagged as an import. The buggy function tries to access the `is_import` attribute directly on the `current_line` object, assuming it will provide the intended behavior. However, as per the provided snippet from the `Line` class, there is no attribute named `is_import` defined on the `Line` class directly. Instead, there is a function `is_import()` in the same module that should be called with the `current_line` object as an argument to get the desired result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to replace the line `current_line.is_import` with a function call `is_import(current_line)` to check if the current line is an import line. By doing this, we ensure that the correct logic is used to determine if the current line is an import or not.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function now correctly identifies if the current line is an import by calling the `is_import` function with the `current_line` object. This should resolve the issue described in the failing test case.
