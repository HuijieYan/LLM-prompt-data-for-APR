### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function where the condition to check if the previous line is an import (`self.previous_line.is_import`) is causing the bug. In Python, classes do not have a flag to indicate whether the function is an import or not. Therefore, checking `self.previous_line.is_import` is not a valid way to determine if the previous line is an import.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the check for `self.previous_line.is_import` and replace it with a different condition that correctly identifies import statements. One way to determine an import statement is to look at the first leaf of the current line and check if it starts with "import". If it does, then we can consider it as an import statement. This approach will help us correctly identify import lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    # Check if the current line starts with "import" to identify an import statement
    if current_line.leaves and current_line.leaves[0].value == "import":
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly identify import statements without raising an error, resolving the bug.
