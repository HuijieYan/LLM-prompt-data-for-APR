### Bug Analysis
The issue in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the condition checking `self.previous_line.is_import`. The buggy function is expecting `is_import` to be an attribute/method of the `Line` class, and based on the provided code, it seems that `is_import` is a standalone function defined outside the `Line` class. Therefore, trying to access it as an attribute of `self.previous_line` results in a `AttributeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to call the standalone function `is_import(self.previous_line)` to get the intended functionality.
2. Ensure that the input parameters for the `is_import` function align with the expected type to handle the `Line` class instances appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by correctly calling the `is_import` function instead of trying to access it as an attribute on the `Line` object. This fix should resolve the `AttributeError` and make the function behave as intended.
