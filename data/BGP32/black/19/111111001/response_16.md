### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function stems from incorrectly checking the `is_import` attribute of the `previous_line`. The issue arises from directly calling `self.previous_line.is_import` which is not a valid approach as `is_import` is a separate function defined outside of the `EmptyLineTracker` class.

### Bug Explanation
When the buggy function tries to access the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line`, it fails because the `is_import` attribute does not exist on `Line` objects. This results in incorrect decisions being made based on the nature of the current line leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to utilize the `is_import` function correctly outside of the class instance. By calling `is_import(self.previous_line)`, we can properly determine if the previous line was an import statement or not. This change will allow the function to make the correct decisions based on the actual property of the previous line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Checking with the correct function
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the comparison related to imports and yield statements, addressing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
