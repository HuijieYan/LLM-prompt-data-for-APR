### Bug Analysis:
In the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, there are several conditions being checked to determine the number of empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. One of the conditions checks if the `current_line` is an import statement by calling `current_line.is_import`. However, instead of calling the related function `is_import` that is defined outside of the class, it directly accesses `current_line.is_import`, likely causing a bug due to the incorrect reference.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from calling `current_line.is_import` directly inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, expecting it to check if the line is an import statement. However, the correct way to check this is by calling the related function `is_import` defined outside the class. This direct reference to `current_line.is_import` inside `_maybe_empty_lines` leads to incorrect behavior and potentially contributes to the failing test as the correct check is not being performed.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to call the `is_import` function defined outside the class properly. This ensures that the correct check is performed to determine if the line is an import statement.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected _maybe_empty_lines function
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(current_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By making this change and correctly referencing the `is_import` function, the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function should pass the failing test cases.
