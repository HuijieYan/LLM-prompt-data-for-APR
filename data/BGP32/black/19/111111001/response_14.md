### Bug Analysis
The bug lies in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class. In the provided code snippets, there are two key points contributing to the failure:
1. The function is trying to access `self.previous_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_yield`, assuming that `self.previous_line` will always have these attributes. However, in some cases, `self.previous_line` might be `None`, causing these attribute accesses to fail.
2. The condition `if current_line.depth: newlines -= 1` is decrementing `newlines` by 1 if `current_line.depth != 0`. However, it is not clear why this decrement is necessary and can lead to incorrect logic depending on the specific case at hand.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `self.previous_line` is not None before accessing attributes `is_import` and `is_yield` to avoid attribute errors.
2. Review the logic related to `newlines` and the condition `if current_line.depth:` to ensure it aligns with the intended behavior and does not introduce inconsistencies.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth else 2

        if current_line.leaves:
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0

        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2

        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)

            if self.previous_line is None:
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_import')
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and hasattr(self.previous_line, 'is_yield')
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
``` 

By fixing the issues mentioned above in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function within the `EmptyLineTracker` class, the provided failing tests should now pass successfully.
