### Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is caused by incorrect handling of special cases related to adding empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function fails to correctly update the `before` value and handle certain conditions, leading to unexpected output in specific scenarios.

#### Issues:
1. The logic for updating the `before` value based on depth comparison is flawed, leading to incorrect empty line insertion.
2. Incorrect handling of cases where the previous line is an import or yield statement, resulting in incorrect empty line insertion.
3. Lack of proper updating of `previous_defs` list in certain conditions, causing incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `before` value is correctly updated based on various conditions in the function.
2. Properly handle cases where the previous line is an import or yield statement to adjust the `before` value accordingly.
3. Update the `previous_defs` list appropriately to maintain the correct depth levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
        
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
        
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned earlier and should now pass the failing test cases.
