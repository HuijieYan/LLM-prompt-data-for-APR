### Bug Analysis:
The bug is related to how the `_maybe_empty_lines` function handles the insertion of empty lines based on certain conditions. The bug is specifically triggered when the code encounters decorators/comments within the code, leading to incorrect handling of empty lines.

#### Issue:
1. The function incorrectly handles the insertion of empty lines before and after certain types of lines like decorators and comments, leading to incorrect formatting.
2. The logic for determining when to insert empty lines is flawed, especially when dealing with decorators and comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Review and update the logic for inserting empty lines based on the conditions specified for decorators and comments.
2. Ensure that the function correctly determines the number of empty lines required before and after certain types of lines.
3. Validate the conditions for inserting empty lines and adjust the logic accordingly.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Call the is_import function to check for import lines
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By updating the conditions for inserting empty lines and ensuring correct handling of decorators, comments, and other line types, the corrected function is expected to pass the failing test.
