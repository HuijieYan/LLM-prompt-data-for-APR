### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the comparison `self.previous_line.is_import` which is causing the failing test. The function is attempting to access an attribute `is_import` on the `self.previous_line` object, but `is_import` is not an attribute of the `Line` class. Instead, the `is_import` function defined outside of the class should be used here.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Update the condition `self.previous_line.is_import` to `is_import(self.previous_line)` to properly check if the previous line is an import.
2. Update the function signature to include the necessary imports.
3. Since `is_import` is defined outside the class, it should be properly imported.
4. Handle cases where `self.previous_line` is None to avoid exceptions.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Tuple

# This should include the import for Leaf and Line if not already present

def is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool:
    # Function body remains the same

@dataclass
class EmptyLineTracker:
    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
            before = min(before, max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        else:
            before = 0
        depth = current_line.depth
        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
        if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None:
                # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
                return 0, 0

            if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
                # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
                return 0, 0

            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and is_import(self.previous_line)
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return (before or 1), 0

        return before, 0
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle the comparison correctly and pass the failing test.
