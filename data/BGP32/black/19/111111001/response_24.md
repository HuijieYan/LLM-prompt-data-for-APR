### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to return the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The bug seems to arise from the condition involving checking if the `previous_line` is an import. The issue stems from incorrectly attempting to access the `is_import` attribute directly on `self.previous_line`, which is an instance of `Line` and not the related `is_import` function. 

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the condition:
```python
if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import
```
Here, `self.previous_line.is_import` is trying to check if the `is_import` attribute of `self.previous_line`, which is an instance of `Line`, is True. This causes an attribute error as `Line` does not have an `is_import` attribute.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is misusing the attribute `is_import` on the `previous_line`, which is an instance of the `Line` class. The code mistakenly checks for the presence of the `is_import` attribute on the `previous_line` instead of invoking the `is_import` function from the related module.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to correctly call the `is_import` function from the same file instead of trying to access an attribute that does not exist. We will replace the problematic condition with a call to the `is_import` function.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function with the bug fixed:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)  # Fix: Using is_import function correctly
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change and invoking the `is_import` function correctly instead of trying to directly access an attribute, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now work as intended.
