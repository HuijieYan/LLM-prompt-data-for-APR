### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the incorrect handling of the conditions for inserting empty lines before and after the currently processed line. The function fails to correctly adjust the number of empty lines needed based on various scenarios like decorators, flow control, imports, and yields.

1. In the first failing test case, the function incorrectly returns extra newlines and fails to handle the case of comments within decorators.
2. Furthermore, the function fails to predict the correct number of newlines needed in the three test cases involving comments within the decorators `# TODO: X`, `# TODO: Y`, and `# TODO: Z`.
3. In the final failing test case, the function does not correctly evaluate the need for empty lines when processing a function definition.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to:
1. Properly handle decorators, including comments within decorators.
2. Adjust the number of newlines needed based on various conditions like flow control, imports, yields, and function definitions.

### Corrected Version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line:
        if self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
            return max(before, 1), 0
        if self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
            return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

By adjusting the logic and conditions within the function, the corrected version should now be able to handle the various scenarios correctly and pass the failing tests.
