### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. The function is responsible for determining the number of extra empty lines that need to be inserted before and after the currently processed line. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of previous line types, resulting in the failing test cases.

1. The function incorrectly identifies when to insert empty lines based on the type of the current and previous lines, such as decorators, imports, yields, and flow control.

2. At the end of the function, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to insert is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we need to adjust the conditions that check the types of the current and previous lines. Additionally, we need to correct the logic for calculating the number of empty lines to be inserted based on the given requirements.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
    
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
    
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

By adjusting the conditions and fixing the logic when determining the number of empty lines to insert, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests.
