### Bug Analysis
The bug arises from the comparison between `current_line.is_import` and `self.previous_line.is_import` in the buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The check for `current_line.is_import` is correct, but the check for `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect. The function is treating `is_import` as a method of `Line` when it is actually a separate function `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool` imported from the same file but from a different class.

The buggy function erroneously tries to access `is_import` directly from `self.previous_line`, which is a `Line` object and does not have an `is_import` attribute, leading to the error when the function tries to execute `self.previous_line.is_import`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Retrieve the state of import from the leaves within each line and pass it to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function directly since it is not an instance method of `Line`.
2. Modify the logic to compare the importer/reference state of the current line with the previous line based on the state received directly from the leaves.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line, current_import_state: bool) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and current_import_state and not self.previous_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By passing the import state from the leaves of the `current_line` to the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, we can correctly compare the import states between the current and previous lines, fixing the bug causing the failing test.
