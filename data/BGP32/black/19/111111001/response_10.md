### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function arises from the comparison and handling of the `current_line.is_import` attribute. The buggy function attempts to call `current_line.is_import`, assuming it is a boolean indicating whether the line is an import statement. However, the function mistakenly treats it as a method which leads to an AttributeError because `current_line` is an instance of the `Line` class which does not have an `is_import` method.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to check the condition correctly by comparing the type of the `current_line` object by checking if it is an instance of a class that represents an import statement. This comparison should be done by checking the type of the object rather than directly calling a method that does not exist on the object.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and type(self.previous_line).__name__ == "ImportLine"  # Check if previous line is an import statement
        and not type(current_line).__name__ == "ImportLine"  # Check if current line is not an import statement
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the comparison between the `current_line` object and the `previous_line` object to determine if they represent import statements and act accordingly. This fix should resolve the attribute error and make the function work as intended.
