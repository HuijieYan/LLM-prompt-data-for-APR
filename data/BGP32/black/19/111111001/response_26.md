### Analysis
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is designed to calculate the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The function has multiple conditional checks based on the attributes of the `Line` object provided as input. However, the bug lies in the comparison related to the `is_import` attribute.

In the buggy code, there is a check for `self.previous_line.is_import` which is trying to access the `is_import` attribute of the `Line` object. However, the function that actually defines the `is_import` behavior is `is_import` in the same file but a different class, which is not correctly linked in the current function.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function is trying to access the `is_import` attribute directly from `self.previous_line`, assuming it's a boolean value. However, the correct way would be to call the `is_import` function with `self.previous_line` as an argument for correct evaluation.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_import` function inside `_maybe_empty_lines` with `self.previous_line` as the leaf parameter. This will correctly determine if the previous line was an import based on the behavior defined in the `is_import` function.

### Corrected Version
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

By making this change, the `_maybe_empty_lines` function will correctly call the `is_import` function to determine if the previous line was an import, fixing the bug and allowing the function to work properly in the context it's used.
