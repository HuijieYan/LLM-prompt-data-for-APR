### Analysis:
The buggy function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for calculating the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. The error occurs when checking conditions related to line types like imports, decorators, yields, etc.

### Bugs:
1. The function references `current_line.is_import`, expecting it to be a function, but the `is_import` method is actually defined in another function in the same file.
2. The usage of `self.previous_line.is_import` is incorrect, causing the function to behave incorrectly when handling import-related conditions.
3. Before returning `newlines, 0`, there is a condition check related to `current_line.is_flow_control`, causing potential incorrect calculations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Replace `current_line.is_import` with a function call to the `is_import` helper function.
2. Use the `is_import` function correctly to check if a line is an import line.
3. Adjust the flow control condition check in correlation with calculating new line counts.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and is_import(self.previous_line)
        and not is_import(current_line)
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and not current_line.is_yield
        and depth != self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
``` 

After applying these fixes, the corrected version of the buggy function should now handle the conditions correctly and pass the failing test case.
