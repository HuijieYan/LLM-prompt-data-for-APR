### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic to handle the indentation level in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function might be incorrect, leading to incorrect results when dealing with tabulated comments.
2. Managing the `wait_for_nl` flag and its associated conditions might not properly handle indented comments after a dedent.
3. Accumulating lines and updating the column count within different conditions could introduce errors in tracking the correct position.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug is causing incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent, leading to varying indentation levels between the commented line and the subsequent code line. This issue results in failing tests and an assertion error when comparing the expected and actual formatted strings, as shown in the error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the indentation tracking logic to correctly handle tabulated comments after a dedent, ensuring consistent indentation levels.
2. Adjust the conditions related to the `wait_for_nl` flag to accurately distinguish between different scenarios like indent continuation and the end of indentation.
3. Ensure proper handling of line accumulation and column count updates based on the specific characters encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By addressing the indentation tracking and handling of tabulated comments, the corrected function should now process the input prefixes accurately and maintain the correct indentation layout as expected.
