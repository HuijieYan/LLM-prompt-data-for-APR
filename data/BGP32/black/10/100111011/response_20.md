### Analysis:
1. The provided `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle consuming parts of a prefix string based on certain conditions related to indentation.
2. The function appears to have a flaw in the logic related to handling indentation and newline characters.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to validate the behavior of the function with specific input cases related to comments and indentation.
4. The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output strings in the failing test.
5. The runtime values and types of variables reveal discrepancies in the handling of indentation levels and newline characters, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of newline characters and indentation levels within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the logic related to tracking and consuming the prefix string based on tabs, spaces, and newlines is flawed. This flaw results in incorrect substring extraction from the input prefix, leading to the failing test scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected output, the logic for tracking indentation levels and handling newline characters needs to be revised. The function should correctly consume the prefix string based on the required conditions for maintaining indentation levels, especially for comments.
1. Ensure the function correctly accounts for tab, space, and newline characters while processing the prefix string.
2. Adjust the logic to handle newline characters within comments and maintain proper indentation levels.
3. Update the checks for column values and newline characters to correctly determine when to extract the prefix substring.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char in {'\n', '\r'}:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char in {'\n', '\r'}:
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function includes adjustments to correctly handle newline characters within comments and ensures proper indentation tracking to extract the required prefix substring. This revised version aims to align the behavior of the function with the intended functionality for handling comments and indentation levels.
