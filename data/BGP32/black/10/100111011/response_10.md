### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit while handling different types of whitespace characters for indentation. The bug seems to occur when encountering a comment at the same level as the indent before it. The function fails to correctly maintain the indentation for such comments in the output.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the issue by comparing the expected output for different input formats. The error message shows a mismatch in the handling of comment indentation in the output.

From the runtime values, it is evident that the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` too early, causing it to treat comments as ending the indent prematurely.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function prematurely sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` when a non-indent character is encountered after the initial indent. This premature setting causes the function to treat subsequent comments as if they end the indent.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles comments and respects the actual indent level before processing them. Adjusting the logic to delay setting `wait_for_nl` until the newline character is encountered should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Handle non-indent characters
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function will handle comments correctly by delaying the update of `wait_for_nl` until it encounters a newline character. This change ensures that comments at the same indent level as the preceding code are processed correctly.
