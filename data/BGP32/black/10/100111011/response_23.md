### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached, handling indentation levels and tabs correctly.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to verify that comments within an indented block retain their correct indentation level, especially after dedenting.
3. The error message highlights a mismatch in the expected and actual string formatting, indicating a failure in preserving the comment indentation level after a dedent operation.
4. The runtime values and types show discrepancies in the variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` during function execution.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the logic inside the function that incorrectly handles waiting for a new line after dedenting. When encountering a space or tab character, the function should increment the `current_column` count accordingly. However, the condition for waiting for a new line is not correctly triggered after dedenting, leading to incorrect behavior when processing comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to waiting for a new line after dedenting to ensure it triggers at the correct point.
2. Update the handling of space, tab, and newline characters to maintain the proper indentation level, especially for comments.
3. Refine the algorithm to accurately track the current column and handle indentation levels before and after dedenting operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version enhances the handling of newline characters and the triggering of the waiting condition, ensuring that comments within the indented block retain their original indentation level, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
