### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string based on the specified column value. The main issue seems to arise from how the function handles whitespace characters ('\n', ' ', '\t') when building the lines. This results in incorrect line formations and, consequently, incorrect indentation.

Specifically, the function fails to correctly consider the existing indentation level when processing the prefix. It incorrectly processes whitespace characters and fails to account for the indentation level after a dedent, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect handling of whitespace characters and the logic for waiting until a new line character '\n' is encountered to capture a complete line. This flawed logic results in misinterpreted indentation levels and line breaks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` correctly based on different types of whitespace characters.
2. Ensure that the function accurately captures lines corresponding to the specified column and indentation levels.
3. Review the conditions for resetting `current_column` and `current_line` to maintain proper line formation and alignment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust as per tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Adjust indentation by considering column
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic within the function to accurately handle whitespace characters and maintain the correct column alignment, the corrected version should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test.
