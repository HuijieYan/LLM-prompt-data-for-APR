### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume the prefix of a string until a specific column is reached, considering indentation with spaces and tabs.
2. The bug lies in the condition where the function is checking if `wait_for_nl` is `True` and the current character is a newline `\n`. This condition is incorrect and causes issues with the comments' indentation after dedents in the test cases.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare the expected and actual formatted strings. The error occurs due to incorrect handling of newline characters leading to incorrect indentation after dedents.
4. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling newline characters when dealing with comments and maintaining the correct indentation within the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the newline characters when dedenting to maintain correct comment indentation.
2. Ensure that the function correctly tracks the column count while consuming characters from the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Changed condition to check column BEFORE adding the line
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Moved line append here for consistent newline handling
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the function to correctly handle newline characters and indentation, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after dedents.
