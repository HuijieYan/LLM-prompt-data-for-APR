### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition for comparing the current_column and column to determine whether to return the result.
2. The handling of tab characters in the loop.
3. The logic of updating current_column and wait_for_nl.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from incorrect handling of tabs and spaces in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`. The function fails to correctly align comments that follow an indented block when tabs are used. This leads to incorrect indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation.

In each failing case, the function fails to correctly process the input prefix, resulting in a misaligned or improperly indented comment. This inconsistency in handling tabs and spaces causes the function to return incorrect output, leading to assertion errors in the test cases and the reported GitHub issue regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to handle tabs and spaces consistently for proper alignment of comments following an indented block. Specifically, the function should accurately update the current column count based on tabs and spaces, ensuring correct indentation levels. Additionally, the function should correctly identify the end of an indentation block and wait for a newline character to ensure proper comment alignment. Ensuring a consistent approach to tab and space handling will address the bug and align with the expected behavior in the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust based on tab width, could be 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += '\n'  # Include newline in the current line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle tab characters accurately and ensuring correct column count updates, the corrected version should address the bug and successfully pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent operations.
