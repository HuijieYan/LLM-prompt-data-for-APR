### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of the prefix string until a certain column without changing the indentation level. However, it fails to handle the indentation of comments correctly in some scenarios.
2. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments after dedenting. This results in incorrect output when comparing with the expected values in the failing test cases.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function when handling comment indentation with different levels of indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles the indentation of comments to ensure they align correctly with the code.
5. Given the insights from the failing test cases and the Github issue, the corrected version of the function should handle comment indentation appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic within the function to properly handle comment indentation, ensuring that comments align with the corresponding code regardless of the indentation level.
2. Update the handling of characters such as spaces and tabs to account for comment indentation scenarios after dedenting.
3. Adjust the conditionals inside the loop to correctly manage the indentation and line breaks when encountering comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic related to comment handling within the function, the corrected version should now manage comment indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
