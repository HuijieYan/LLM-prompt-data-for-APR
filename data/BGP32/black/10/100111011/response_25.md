### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume characters until it encounters a newline to manage indentation levels correctly. The bug arises due to the mishandling of tab characters and indentation levels, leading to incorrect output especially with tab-based indentation.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, which is incorrect, as tabs are generally considered as equal to a certain number of spaces.
2. The function does not handle tab characters properly inside the `if char == '\t':` block, resulting in incorrect indentation calculations.
3. The `wait_for_nl` flag might not be getting reset properly when encountering a tab character, leading to incorrect processing.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle tab characters by incrementing `current_column` with the number of spaces equivalent to a tab.
2. Correct the logic to properly handle tab characters and reset the necessary flags to ensure accurate indentation processing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Define the tab width (e.g., 4 spaces per tab)
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':  # Handle tab characters
            space_to_add = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_line += ' ' * space_to_add
            current_column += space_to_add
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the tab handling logic and ensuring proper flag management, this corrected version should accurately process the prefix while preserving correct indentation, thereby addressing the issue observed in the failing tests and the GitHub report.
