### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is meant to consume a prefix string until a certain column position in the code. However, it fails to handle cases where a comment follows an indented block correctly.
2. The bug is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent in the code with leading tabs.
3. Looking at the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, it shows that the expected and actual outputs are not matching for the input with leading tabs.
4. The root cause is the logic related to handling indentation levels and newline characters in the function, leading to incorrect prefix extraction.
5. To fix the bug, the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the scenario where a comment follows an indented block.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to handle correct extraction of the prefix until the desired column position is reached while maintaining the proper indentation for comments.
2. Make adjustments specifically for cases where a comment follows an indented block to ensure the correct behavior.
3. Test the function with different scenarios, especially focusing on cases involving comments and indentation, to confirm the bug fix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in this corrected version of the function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
