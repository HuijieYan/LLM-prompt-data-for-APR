### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume characters from a given prefix until a specific column position is reached. It keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether it should wait for a new line to start based on the indentation.
2. The bug seems to occur when handling comments with varying levels of indentation after code blocks. This causes the comment indentation to be altered incorrectly.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare formatted strings with tabs and spaces but fails in scenarios where comments are involved due to incorrect handling of tabulation.
4. The function fails to capture the correct indentation level of comments after dedents, leading to formatting discrepancies between tabs and spaces.
5. To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the indentation levels of comments relative to the surrounding code blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that comments retain their original indentation level after dedents in the input.
2. Update the logic to handle correct tabulation for comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
3. Adjust the tabulation tracking mechanism to handle comments effectively.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if not current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust tab calculation
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Outcome:
The corrected function aims to appropriately handle the indentation levels of comments within the provided prefix. By making adjustments to tabulation calculations and comment line detection, it ensures that comments maintain correct levels of indentation relative to the code blocks. By applying these modifications, the function should pass the failing test scenario involving comments with varying indentation.
