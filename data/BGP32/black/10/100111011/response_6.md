### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume characters up to a specified column number in a prefix string. The issue arises when handling tab characters and newline characters within the prefix.
2. The primary potential error locations include the logic for handling tab characters and the newline character case while waiting for a newline character after indentation.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle tab characters' indentation and newline characters when waiting for a newline after the last indentation. This leads to incorrect column adjustment and results in incorrect indentation in the output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle tab characters' indentation and newline characters, ensuring correct alignment based on the specified column.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying this correction to properly handle tab characters and ensure correct indentation after newline characters will resolve the bug as reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
