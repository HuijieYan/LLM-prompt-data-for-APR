### Bug Explanation:

The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of tab characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column, keeping track of spaces and tabs for indentation levels. However, it does not correctly handle tab characters when calculating the indentation level.

### Bug Location:

The bug is likely caused by the discrepancy in handling tab characters (`'\t'`) within the function. Tab characters should increment the `current_column` by 4 spaces, but the function is adding them as single characters, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters to correctly calculate the indentation levels using tabs. Specifically, when encountering a tab character (`'\t'`), the `current_column` should be increased by a consistent tab width (e.g., 4 spaces) to match Python's standard tab size.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to correctly handle tab characters, it should now accurately track the indentation levels and correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column.

After making these changes, the function should pass the failing test related to comment indentation in the Black test suite.
