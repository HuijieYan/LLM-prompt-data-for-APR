### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` fails to handle the indentation of comments correctly after dedenting in the presence of tabs. The logic of the function is causing the incorrect behavior where comments lose their indentation relative to the code after a dedent.

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in the condition where the comment is not correctly aligned when there is a dedent. The statement `if char == '\n':` resets the column to 0, causing the comment's indentation to be adjusted incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to adjust how comments are handled when there is a dedent. We should ensure that comments retain their relative indentation compared to the code. This can be done by tracking the first non-space/tab character in each line to calculate the correct offset for comments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # check if the line contains only spaces/tabs
            if current_line.isspace():
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # calculate the offset based on the first non-space/tab character
                offset = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                if current_column < offset:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the modification as described above, the corrected version of the function now properly handles comments' indentation after a dedent and should pass the failing test case mentioned.
