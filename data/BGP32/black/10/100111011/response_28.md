### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column might not be correctly implemented.
2. Handling of tab characters in calculating the column number might be incorrect.
3. Logic for processing characters after encountering an empty line might be faulty.
4. The return statement might not provide the expected output by concatenating the final lines correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation level and processing of characters in the input prefix. This results in incorrect output, especially when dealing with tab characters. The function fails to correctly align comments based on the specified column number, leading to inconsistent indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the conditions for checking line content and column alignment.
2. Ensure proper handling of tab characters and adjust the column count accordingly.
3. Update processing logic for characters following empty lines to maintain indentation.
4. Modify the return statement to concatenate lines correctly for the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the suggested fix strategy into the corrected version of the function, we aim to address the root cause of the bug and ensure proper alignment and processing of the input prefix.
