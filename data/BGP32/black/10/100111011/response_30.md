### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling the indentation of comments after dedentations. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of whitespaces and tabs, leading to unexpected indentation changes in comments.

Based on the provided test and the runtime variable values:
- In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of the comment after dedentation, resulting in incorrect output.
- In Case 3, the function incorrectly processes the tab character in the prefix, leading to the misalignment of the comment indentation.
- In Case 5, the function's flawed logic causes deviations in the comment's expected indentation level.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, focus on refining the logic that handles whitespaces and tabs during the processing of the prefix. It is crucial to ensure that the expected indentation for comments following dedentations is accurately maintained.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version enhances the handling of whitespaces and tabs, ensuring that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments following dedentations. It considers both the column comparison and the correct tab size to align the comment correctly.
