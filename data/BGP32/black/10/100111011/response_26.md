### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix character by character up to a certain column value. However, it fails to handle indentation levels correctly.
2. The function does not consider preserving the relative indentation of comments with respect to the following lines after a dedent operation.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights this issue by comparing the indentation of comments between spaces and tabs. The error message indicates a mismatch due to incorrect comment indentation.
4. The GitHub issue further confirms the problem when using tabs for indentation, where comments lose their correct relative position after dedent.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to mishandle the indentation logic when encountering a comment after dedent because it does not consider adjusting the comment indentation appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle preserving comment indentation relative to the next line, especially after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_indent = 0  # Track the indentation level for comments
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                comment_indent = 0  # Reset comment indentation
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            comment_indent = current_column  # Track current column for comments
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if comment_indent > current_column:
                diff = comment_indent - current_column
                current_line += ' ' * diff  # Adjust comment indentation

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By tracking the comment indentation level and adjusting it relative to the current line's column value, we ensure that comments remain correctly aligned in the corrected version of the function.
