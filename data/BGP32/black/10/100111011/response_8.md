## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the input `prefix` string up to a certain column position to be used for formatting purposes. The bug seems to arise from incorrect handling of the new line character (`\n`) within the function.

In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, it is noticeable that the issue arises when there is a comment with spaces or tabs in it. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the newline character after the comment within the prefix string, resulting in incorrect formatting when converting tabs to spaces.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the newline character (`\n`) inside the `prefix` string. Specifically, when encountering `\n` within a comment that includes spaces or tabs, the function does not properly account for the column position, leading to incorrect behavior when converting tabs to spaces.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the newline character (`\n`) when consuming the prefix string to maintain correct column positions, especially when dealing with comments that include spaces or tabs.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column position for a new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag for the newline character
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the column position is properly maintained when encountering newline characters within the prefix string, specifically considering comments with spaces or tabs.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle the input scenarios provided in the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` and address the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
