### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels in the provided prefix text. When encountering a line with only spaces or tabs, the function tracks the column count to update indentation. However, if there is a tab character within the current line, it does not correctly adjust the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect calculations for indentation levels.

This bug results in misaligned comments in the test cases where the bug is triggered.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately handles tab characters when calculating the current column. The function should consider each tab character as incrementing the column by 4, matching the behavior of Python tab stops. By correctly updating the `current_column` value, the function should properly align the comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the `current_column` value properly by incrementing it by 4 for each tab character encountered. This adjustment ensures that the function accurately tracks the column position and handles tab characters within the prefix text. This correction should resolve the indentation alignment issue with comments in the test cases provided.
