### Identification of Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition being checked after encountering '\n' might not correctly consider the indentation level.
2. The update of the 'current_column' variable seems incorrect in some cases, leading to incorrect calculation of indentation.
3. The handling of wait_for_nl may not be accurately resetting for certain scenarios.

### Explanation of Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function incorrectly adjusts the indentation of comments, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. This bug is reflected in the failed assertion due to the incorrect indentation of the comment line.

The main cause of this bug is the logic that handles indentation levels after encountering a newline character. The bug causes the comment's indentation to be inconsistent with the surrounding code.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To resolve this bug, the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be corrected to accurately handle and maintain the correct indentation levels, especially for comments. It requires a more precise adjustment of the current indentation column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic related to the indentation adjustment while handling various characters in the input string, the corrected version of the function should now maintain the correct indentation levels and pass the failing test cases, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
