### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the prefix of a string given a specific column value by constructing lines based on the input characters. The bug appears to be related to handling tab characters '\t' when determining the column position.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to compare the formatted content with tabs (`contents_tab`) and spaces (`contents_spc`). The error message indicates a mismatch in the comment indentation after a dedent operation.

Based on the runtime values, the current implementation fails to correctly handle tab characters. The function gets confused between tab and space characters, leading to incorrect column positions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the discrepancy in handling tab characters when calculating the column position. The function incorrectly accounts for the difference in width between tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect indentations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are appropriately handled when determining the column position. Correctly counting the tab width is crucial to maintaining consistent indentation throughout the prefix processing.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate tab width based on the current_column
            tab_width = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += tab_width
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly calculates the width of tabs and advances the column position accordingly. This adjustment should ensure consistent indentation handling for both tabs and spaces, resolving the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
