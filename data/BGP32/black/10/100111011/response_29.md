Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the conditions checking the newline characters and handling leading whitespace. The issue occurs when the function encounters a tab character ('\t') as part of the input prefix, which causes incorrect indentations in the output.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the handling of tab characters ('\t') to correctly calculate the column position based on the defined tab width (in this case, 4 spaces). Additionally, the function should track whether the indentation for a line has been completed before moving to a new line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes specific handling for tab characters to adjust the column position based on the tab width. With this adjustment, the function should now process the input prefix correctly and produce the expected indentation in the output.
