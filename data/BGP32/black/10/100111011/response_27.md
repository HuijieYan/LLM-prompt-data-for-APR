### Bug Explanation:
The bug in `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the processing of the `wait_for_nl` flag. This flag is being set to `True` when an indent is finished, but it should be set to `False` because the loop continues to process characters in the prefix string and should not wait for a newline at that point.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `False` after handling an indent in the prefix string. This adjustment will allow the function to correctly process the subsequent characters without waiting for a newline.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = False  # Adjusted to set wait_for_nl to False after handling an indent

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the condition that sets `wait_for_nl` to `False` after processing an indent, the corrected function should now accurately handle the prefix string and pass the failing test case.
