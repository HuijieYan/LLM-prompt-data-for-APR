### Identifying the Bug
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to process a given prefix string based on certain indentation rules. The primary issue stems from the incorrect handling of whitespace characters and newlines within the input prefix. The function fails to maintain consistent indentation levels for comments when there are dedentations involved.

Based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, it is clear that the function is not correctly preserving the original indentation of comments after a dedent operation, leading to the assertion failure.

### Cause of the Bug
When the function encounters a newline character `\n` following indentation spaces or tabs, it incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 for all scenarios. This behavior disrupts the handling of comments that come after dedentations, causing the discrepancy in the test results.

For instance, in Case 1, the function fails to correctly account for the existing indentation in the prefix string, resulting in the improper handling of the comment indentation after the dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the function needs to distinguish between normal newline occurrences and those that indicate dedentations. By adjusting the logic related to newline characters in combination with the current column count, the function can maintain the correct indentation levels for subsequent elements in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column == 0:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the newline handling logic as described above, the corrected function should now handle indentations and dedentations properly.

### Verification
After implementing the corrections, running the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should now pass successfully without any assertion failures. The corrected function should uphold the indentation consistency required for maintaining proper comment display after dedent operations.
