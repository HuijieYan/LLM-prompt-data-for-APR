### Problem Identification
The bug is observed in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` which is incorrectly handling the indentation levels in the input prefix. This causes issues with maintaining consistent indentation, especially for comments after a dedent.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True`. In this situation, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 instead of preserving the indentation level.

#### Error Scenario
Consider the failing test case `contents_tab = "if 1:\n\tif 2:\n\t\tpass\n\t# comment\n\tpass\n"`:
- In this scenario, the function receives the prefix `'    # comment\n    '` and a column value of 8.
- At the return statement, the `current_line` is `'    # comment\n'`, `lines` is empty, and `current_column` is incorrectly reset to 0 because of encountering a newline character with `wait_for_nl` set to True.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent by properly updating the `current_column` value when encountering a newline character. Hence, we should modify the logic handling newline characters while waiting for a newline.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                # Add the current line considering the correct column value
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle the indentation levels and return the expected output for the failing test cases. This updated version will align with the requirements specified in the GitHub issue concerning maintaining consistent indentation for comments after a dedent.
