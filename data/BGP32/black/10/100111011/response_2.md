### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column might be incorrect.
2. The logic for handling tabs and spaces might be causing the unexpected indentation changes.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles indentation when encountering comments. The function incorrectly adjusts the indentation when encountering comments after a dedent, especially for tabulated code. This leads to incorrect reformatting of comments.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` provides scenarios with different indentation levels and comment positions to highlight the issue. The error message shows a direct comparison of the expected output with the actual output, emphasizing the difference due to incorrect handling of comments after dedents.

In the runtime values and types of variables provided, the issue stems from the incorrect updating of the `current_column` when encountering comments, tabs, or spaces. This leads to misalignments in the generated output, causing the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the existing code indentation, especially after dedents. Adjustments to how tabs and spaces are handled, along with proper tracking of the current column position, are crucial for resolving the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Note:
In the corrected version of the function, the additional condition `if char == '#'` was added to correctly handle comments and align their indentation based on previous code blocks. This adjustment ensures that comments maintain the correct indentation level, especially after dedents, resolving the bug highlighted by the failing test and the GitHub issue.
