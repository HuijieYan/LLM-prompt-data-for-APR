### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix until a specific column and return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.
2. The function has issues with handling newline characters and updating the `current_column` correctly.
3. The failing test indicates a problem where the comment indentation is incorrect.
4. The provided test fails due to a discrepancy in the output between the expected and actual formats.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a problem with tabulated comments and incorrect indentation after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of newlines and column tracking. When encountering a newline character, the function should reset the `current_column` to 0. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly, resulting in incorrect column tracking and, consequently, incorrect comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to properly reset `current_column` when a newline is encountered.
2. Ensure correct handling of various characters to maintain accurate column tracking.
3. Refactor the `wait_for_nl` logic to handle newline characters effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset column on newline
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column on newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, the `current_column` will be correctly reset to 0 when encountering newline characters. This change should address the incorrect comment indentation issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
