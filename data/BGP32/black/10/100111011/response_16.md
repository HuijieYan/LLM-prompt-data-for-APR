### Bug Analysis:
- The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix of text until a certain column value, handling indentation levels and newlines.
- The bug seems to be related to how tab characters are handled in determining the indentation level of comments.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` confirms that the issue specifically arises when handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.
- The error message indicates a discrepancy in the expected output vs. the actual output, specifically involving the indentation of comments.
- The runtime values and types of variables indicate an incorrect handling of indentation levels, especially with tab characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the provided buggy function, when encountering a tab character, `'\t'`, the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of resetting it to the next multiple of 8 (standard tab width).
- This incorrect handling of tab characters leads to misinterpretation of the actual column position, resulting in improper indentation of comments after a dedent.
- The failing test scenarios expose this issue when comparing the actual output to the expected output, highlighting the discrepancy in comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic for tab character handling to ensure the correct calculation of the column position following a tab.
- Update the logic to reset the column position to the next tab stop (multiples of 8) when encountering a '\t' character to align with standard tab behavior.
- Check and adjust the indent levels to maintain consistency in comment indentation after dedents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # Reset to next tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab characters to reset the column position to the next tab stop and ensuring consistent indentation logic, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases, thereby resolving the reported GitHub issue.
