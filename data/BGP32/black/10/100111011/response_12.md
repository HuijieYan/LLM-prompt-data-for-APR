### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix input while maintaining the correct indentation level based on spaces and tabs. The issue arises when encountering a comment after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation. This bug causes the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce assertion errors due to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

The function incorrectly handles the case where a comment is encountered after spaces or tabs, resulting in wrong indentation levels for comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` when encountering a character that signifies the start of the next line while waiting for a new line. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments following a dedent, leading to the observed incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in `_partially_consume_prefix`, ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation when encountering comments after dedents. Adjust the logic to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after dedents while consuming the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in (' ', '\t'):
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version of `_partially_consume_prefix`, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent, resolving the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
