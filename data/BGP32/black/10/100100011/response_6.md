The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles processing tab characters while tracking the current column position.

Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) in the function may not accurately reflect the intended indentation level.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when there is a mix of spaces and tabs used for indentation in the input code. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation calculation for comments after a dedent.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function correctly handles tab characters (`\t`) to calculate the actual indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # Let's assume tab size is 4 for consistency

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Calculate number of spaces needed to reach the next tab position
            spaces_to_next_tab = tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
          
            # Add required spaces to current line
            current_line += " " * spaces_to_next_tab
            current_column += spaces_to_next_tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char != '\n' else 0

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function now properly handles tab characters and should resolve the issue observed when handling tabulated comments after a dedent.
