## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is attempting to process a prefix string character by character, keeping track of the current line and column to properly handle the indentation. The issue arises when encountering a comment (#) after a dedent, causing incorrect indentation changes.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The logic for handling a comment after a dedent seems to be incorrect.
2. The "wait_for_nl" flag may not be working as intended.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because when a comment (#) is encountered at a specific indentation level, it should maintain the same level as the code following it. However, the current implementation fails to handle this scenario correctly, resulting in indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the logic within the function to properly handle comments after a dedent. When encountering a comment, ensure it maintains the same indentation level as the code following it. Additionally, verify the usage of the "wait_for_nl" flag for accurate control flow.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # handle comments to maintain proper indentation
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the elif condition for handling comments (#) and properly resetting the line and column values, this corrected version should address the bug and allow the function to handle tabulated comments after a dedent accurately.
