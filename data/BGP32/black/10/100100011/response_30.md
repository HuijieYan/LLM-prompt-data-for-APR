The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent in code that uses tabs. The issue reported on GitHub provides a clear example of the problem and its impact on the code formatting when using the Black tool.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when spaces are used to calculate the current column position, but the actual code uses tabs for indentation. This discrepancy leads to incorrect calculations of indentation, especially when dealing with comments.

The function fails to handle the scenario where a tab character '\t' is encountered for indentation properly. As a result, the comment indentation after dedent is not preserved correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters ('\t') for indentation. We should adjust the current column calculation logic to consider each tab character as equal to four spaces (standard tab width).

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += "    "  # Replacing tab with 4 spaces
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above changes to handle tab characters correctly in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the corrected version should now preserve the correct indentation for comments after a dedent when using tabs. This fix should address the reported GitHub issue and make the test function pass successfully.
