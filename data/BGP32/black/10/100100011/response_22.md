### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume whitespace and indentation in a given prefix string until a specific column is reached.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that indentation for comments after a dedent was being changed incorrectly when using tabs in the input file.
3. The failing test function `test_comment_indentation` aims to test and compare the indentation for comments using tabs and spaces in a specific code snippet.
4. The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent with tabs, leading to incorrect reformatting.
5. The function fails to properly handle the indentation level for comments when tabs are used, resulting in the reported issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle different types of whitespace characters, including tabs.
2. Specifically address the issue of incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
3. Update the behavior of the function to maintain consistent indentation levels, especially for comments, regardless of the type of whitespace used.
4. Ensure that the function correctly processes the input prefix string and aligns the comments appropriately based on the given column parameter.
5. Modify the function to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure the test cases pass for both tabs and spaces in the input files.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust tab processing to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab processing to 4 spaces and updating the logic for handling different types of whitespace characters, the corrected version of the function should resolve the reported bug and pass the failing test cases.
