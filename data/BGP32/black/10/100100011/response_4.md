### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation levels within the provided prefix string.
2. The test function `test_comment_indentation` is checking if comments are correctly indented within a given code block.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
4. The bug occurs when a comment is encountered after a dedent operation, where the comment is not correctly aligned with the subsequent code.

### Cause of Bug:
1. The bug occurs due to the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not handling the indentation of comments properly after a dedent operation.
2. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function does not adjust the column position correctly, leading to incorrect comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.
2. Keep track of the current column position and adjust it accordingly when encountering a comment after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition `elif char == '#'`, we can now correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
