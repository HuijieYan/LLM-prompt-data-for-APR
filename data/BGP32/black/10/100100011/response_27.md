The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly consuming characters with regards to indentation handling. This bug results in the incorrect formatting of comments after dedents when using tabs in the code.

The bug occurs due to the misalignment of indentation levels when consuming characters, leading to incorrect formatting results, particularly with comments after dedents.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of indentation and newline characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly align the code structure. By ensuring proper tracking of indentation levels and newline characters, we can resolve the issue with incorrect comment formatting after dedents when using tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust the tab calculation
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # Add condition to handle empty lines properly
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the tab handling to align with the correct indentation levels and adding a condition to handle empty lines appropriately, the corrected function now accurately processes the prefix string, resolving the indentation formatting issue with comments after dedents when using tabs.
