## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to handle indentation levels while parsing code. The function processes the input prefix character by character and updates the current line and column of the code being parsed.

2. The bug appears to be related to the handling of tabs and spaces in the input code, causing incorrect indentation for comments after dedents, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug is likely due to the way tabs are counted in the `current_column` variable. This leads to incorrect column calculations when tabs are encountered.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when tabs are encountered in the input prefix. Tabs are mistakenly counted as 4 spaces each, leading to incorrect column calculations.
- When a dedent after tabs is encountered, the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True, which is used to wait for a newline character. When the newline character is encountered, the code incorrectly handles the indentation level.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the handling of tabs and spaces in calculating the column position needs to be adjusted. When a tab character is encountered, the column should be increased by the appropriate tab size (usually 4 spaces) instead of counting each tab as 4 spaces.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust tab size
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab size increment in the `current_column` calculation, the corrected function should now handle tabs and spaces correctly to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
