### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming prefix characters until a certain column is reached or a newline character is encountered.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to check the formatting of code with both tab and space indentation, including comments.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the test scenario involving tab indentation and comments.
4. The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character right before a comment line, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function due to the improper handling of tab characters preceding comments. When a tab character is encountered before a comment, it increments the `current_column` by 4, affecting subsequent comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the indentation issue with tabulated comments after a dedent, we need to adjust the logic of dealing with tab characters affecting column tracking. Specifically, the tab character should be treated consistently to prevent incorrect indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By making the specified adjustment when encountering a tab character, the corrected function ensures consistent handling of tabulated comments during indentation processing. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
