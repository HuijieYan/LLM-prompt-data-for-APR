## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on certain conditions like spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is testing the behavior of indentation in the presence of comments in a given code snippet.
3. The GitHub issue reports that the library, when operating on code using tabs, incorrectly changes the indentation for comments after a dedent.

## Error Location:
The cause of the bug is likely to be in the logic related to handling comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It seems that the current implementation does not properly consider the impact of comments on indentation levels.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not correctly handle the scenario where a comment is encountered following a dedented block. This results in an incorrect adjustment of indentation for comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario where a comment appears after a dedent. This involves adjusting the logic related to processing comments and their indentation levels in the given prefix.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:                    
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic related to handling comments and their impact on indentation levels, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the indentation issue reported on GitHub.
