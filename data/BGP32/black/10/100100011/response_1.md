### Analysis:
Upon analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we can see that it is intended to partially consume a prefix text until a specific column is reached. The function struggles with properly handling the indentation of comments as described in the failing test and GitHub issue.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of handling tabulation (`\t`) characters within the prefix text. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4. This discrepancy in handling tabs results in incorrect column tracking and therefore incorrect indentation alignment for comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters to ensure that the `current_column` is properly incremented by the same amount as a single tab stop. This will ensure proper column tracking and alignment for comments.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)  # Adjust the column for tab stops
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters to calculate the correct column position based on tab stops. This should ensure that the comments are properly aligned after dedent operations.

### Conclusion:
With the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue described in the failing test and GitHub bug report should be resolved. The function now handles tab characters correctly, ensuring proper column tracking and indentation alignment for comments, as expected.
