### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test function demonstrates that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not handling tab characters ('\\t') correctly.
2. The GitHub issue describes a related problem where comments with tab indentation are not being formatted correctly after a dedent operation.
3. The `current_column` variable seems to not be updated correctly, leading to incorrect handling of tab characters and indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not update `current_column` correctly when encountering tab characters ('\\t'). This results in incorrect calculation of the column position, leading to incorrect handling of indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable is incremented by 4 when encountering a tab character ('\\t'). This adjustment will correctly calculate the column position and handle tab indentation appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle tab characters and indentation, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
