### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to handle indentation in the input code.
- The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` in `test_black.py` checks for correct comment indentation after dedent, particularly when tabs are used.
- The GitHub issue reported an incorrect behavior with tabulated comments after a dedent when using the Black formatter, indicating a problem with the indentation preservation for comments.

### Bugs:
1. The function incorrectly handles tabulated comments after dedent, leading to incorrect indentation in the output.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case where a comment follows an indentation level that should be maintained according to input tabs. This results in the comment being misaligned in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the function `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle tabulated comments after dedent, ensuring that the comment maintains the same level of indentation as the following code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    comment_indent = -1
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                if comment_indent >= 0:
                    lines[-1] = " " * comment_indent + lines[-1].lstrip()
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                comment_indent = -1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            comment_indent = -1
            current_column = 0
        else:
            comment_indent = current_column
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this corrected version, the function should now handle tabulated comments after dedent correctly, ensuring the desired indentation alignment is maintained for comments following a dedent in the input code.
