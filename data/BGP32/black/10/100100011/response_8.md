### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is used to handle indentation manipulation in the `black` code formatter library. The function incorrectly handles the scenario where a comment is present after a dedent with tabs in the input content. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments in the reformatted output.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in how the function handles the `wait_for_nl` condition. The function fails to consider the case where a comment is present after a dedent with tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the premature termination of the function when it encounters a newline character after a dedent. This causes the comment to be misplaced in the reformatted output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle cases where a comment follows a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function identifies and preserves the correct indentation level for comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_indent:
            if char not in [' ', '\t']:
                wait_for_indent = False
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_indent = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the issue with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent with tabs should be resolved. This corrected version ensures that comments are properly handled in the context of dedented code blocks, maintaining the correct indentation levels.
