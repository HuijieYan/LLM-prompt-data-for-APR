## Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is parsing a given prefix by consuming characters until a specific column is reached.
2. The bug most likely occurs when tab characters are involved and cause incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates how the current implementation fails to handle tab characters correctly in comments.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where tabs are used, leading to incorrect comment indentation after dedent.
5. The root cause is the handling of tabs and their impact on column calculations within the `wait_for_nl` condition.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters in the `elif char == '\t':` branch. Tabs are counted as 1 character but should be considered as 4 characters for indentation purposes, leading to column miscalculation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the handling of tab characters to correctly increment the column by 4, similar to spaces, in order to maintain proper tracking of the current column position.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Fix: Consider tabs as 4 spaces for column calculation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of tab characters in the `elif char == '\t':` branch by incrementing the column by 4 instead of 1, the corrected version of the function should now handle tab characters properly and pass the failing test case.
