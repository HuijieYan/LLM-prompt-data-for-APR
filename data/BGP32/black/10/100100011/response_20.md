The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect handling of tab characters '\t' within the input prefix string when calculating the column position. This results in incorrect indentation levels after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the current column position when encountering tab characters. We should properly handle tab characters by incrementing the current column position by a multiple of 4, as tabs are typically considered equivalent to 4 spaces or a fixed width.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle tab characters, ensuring that the column position is calculated accurately, and the indentation levels are maintained after a dedent. This should address the issue described in the GitHub report and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
