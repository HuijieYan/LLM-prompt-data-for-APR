## Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on the column information provided.
2. The function seems to have issues with handling the indentation level for comments correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in the test case.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, especially when using tabs for indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels, including comments, when consuming the prefix text.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle the indentation levels correctly, especially in the case of comments. This leads to incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix text and results in the test case failure.

## Fix strategy:
1. Update the function to correctly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix text.
2. Ensure that the logic considers different scenarios like spaces, tabs, new lines, and comments.
3. Adjust the function to correctly identify the column position and handle the indentation format.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Handle comment indentation
            spaces_needed = column - current_column
            if spaces_needed > 0:
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_needed
                current_column += spaces_needed
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the comment indentation handling logic in the corrected version of the function, we should be able to address the bug and ensure that the test case `test_comment_indentation` passes successfully.
