### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling line indentation in the presence of comments in the input prefix.
2. The bug is related to the handling of tabs and spaces in the input prefix while handling comments.
3. The GitHub issue pointed out a scenario where comments past a certain depth were incorrectly reindented after a dedent, specifically when the input file uses tabs.
4. The current implementation fails to correctly identify and maintain the indent level for comments after dedenting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering tabs and spaces in the input prefix string. The function fails to distinguish the correct column indentation when a comment appears after a dedent operation.

### Fixing Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle the indentation level, especially when a comment is encountered after a dedent operation.
2. Re-assess the calculation of indentation based on tab and space characters within the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above changes to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
