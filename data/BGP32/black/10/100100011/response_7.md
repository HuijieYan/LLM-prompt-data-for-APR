## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix of a string based on indentation levels and the specified column.
2. In the provided failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the issue is related to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.
3. The GitHub issue describes how `black` incorrectly changes the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent in specific scenarios involving tabs in the input file.
4. The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of tabulation characters ('\t') inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs in `_partially_consume_prefix` function due to the incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') when calculating the current column and waiting for a newline.
- When encountering a tab character, the current column is being increased by 4 instead of treating it as a single character advancement.
- This leads to incorrect indentation level tracking and results in incorrect handling of comments after dedent when tabs are used in the input file.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the section of the function that handles tab characters ('\t') to increment the current column by 1 instead of 4.
- Ensure proper tracking of the current column for tabulated lines to accurately handle indentation levels.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Increment by 1 for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this modification to increment the current column by 1 for tab characters, the corrected function should now handle the indentation levels correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue related to tabulated comments after a dedent.
