### Analysis:
1. The _partially_consume_prefix function is responsible for handling indentation in the input code.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected formatted output of code using tabs and spaces.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation levels and newlines when processing the input code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character within the processed prefix of the input code. It incorrectly calculates the column position, leading to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles tab characters correctly and calculates the column position accurately based on the tab stops defined.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            next_tab = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_column = next_tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will handle tab characters correctly by calculating the next tab stop position based on the current column position. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
