### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is called by the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to compare the formatted output of content with tabs and spaces.
2. The failing test checks if the prefix given to the function is correctly processed and formatted.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation when encountering comments in the input.
4. The GitHub issue confirms that the bug specifically affects the indentation of comments after dedent.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the function fails to retain the correct indentation for comments after a dedent.
2. When encountering a comment that should maintain the same indentation level as the following line, the function incorrectly changes the comment's indentation.
3. This leads to inconsistent indentation output, especially when dealing with tab vs. space indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct indentation level is preserved for comments, especially after a dedent operation.
2. A key focus should be on correctly handling the indentation of comments to match the surrounding code blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_char = None
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = prev_char[-1] if prev_char and prev_char[-1] > current_column else 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        prev_char = (prev_char[-2], current_column) if prev_char and prev_char[-1] > current_column else (prev_char, current_column) 
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added `prev_char` variable to track the previous character and its column position.
2. Adjusted the `current_column` value when encountering a new line to handle the correct indentation.
3. Updated the logic to reset the column as per the previous character's position after encountering a line break.
4. Ensured that the indentation level for comments is maintained correctly after a dedent.

By applying these corrections, the corrected version should address the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
