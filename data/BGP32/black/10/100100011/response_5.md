## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be responsible for incorrect handling of indentation when dealing with tabs in the input code. This issue is identified in the failing test `test_comment_indentation` where comments are not aligned correctly after dedenting.

The specific problem lies in the indentation logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function doesn't properly handle tab characters (\t) when calculating column positions, resulting in incorrect indentation levels.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering tab characters, the function should increment the `current_column` by 4 to match the standard tab width. Instead, it currently increments `current_column` by 1 for each tab character, causing a mismatch in the indentation levels compared to the input code.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are correctly interpreted and handled in the `current_column` calculation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Adjusting the logic to increment `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character will align the calculation with the standard tab width.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the `current_column` is appropriately incremented by 4 when encountering tab characters, ensuring correct indentation levels are maintained. This fix should address the bug reported on GitHub and make the `test_comment_indentation` pass successfully.
