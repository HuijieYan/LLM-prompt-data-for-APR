### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a prefix given a specific column.
2. The function iterates over characters in the prefix, checking for spaces, tabs, and newlines to handle indentation.
3. The bug likely occurs when there is a newline character after a block of spaces or tabs, causing the incorrect handling of comments indentation.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the issue with comments indentation after a dedent operation.
5. The GitHub issue describes a specific scenario where the indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly when using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent operation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When the function encounters a newline character after a block of spaces or tabs, it fails to correctly maintain the relative indentation of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle comment indentation after dedent operations. This involves ensuring that comments are aligned correctly based on the existing code indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # adjust comment indentation
            adjusted_line = current_line.lstrip()
            if adjusted_line.startswith('#') and len(adjusted_line) < current_column:
                adjusted_line = ' ' * (current_column - len(adjusted_line)) + adjusted_line
                current_line = current_line[:-len(adjusted_line)] + adjusted_line

            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle comment indentation after a dedent operation, addressing the bug described in the failing test and the GitHub issue. Make sure to test the corrected function thoroughly to ensure it resolves the indent-related issue.
