### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation and newlines within a given source code prefix.
2. The function fails to correctly handle indentation levels when encountering comments after a dedent.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the issue by comparing two sets of source code with tabs and spaces. The function fails to maintain correct comment indentation.
4. The GitHub issue further elaborates on the problem, suggesting that Black reformats the code incorrectly, causing comments to be misaligned after a dedent.
5. To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments after a dedent. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for the comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle comments after a dedent.
2. Update the function to ensure that comments are aligned at the correct indentation level relative to the surrounding code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent_level = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                indent_level = current_column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line.replace(' ' * indent_level, '', 1)
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle comments after a dedent correctly and align them at the appropriate indentation level specified by the surrounding code. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
