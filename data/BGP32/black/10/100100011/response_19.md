The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for a newline character. The function fails to correctly handle the scenario where a comment follows an indented block.

The bug causes incorrect indentation when handling comments after a dedent, especially in cases where tabs are used in the input code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly account for the indentation level and handle comments after a dedent correctly. The logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a newline needs to be adjusted to ensure correct behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the test function `test_comment_indentation` should pass successfully. The function now correctly handles comments after dedents and ensures the appropriate level of indentation is maintained.
