### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix related to the indentation in Python code. The function tracks the current line, column, and handles different characters like space, tab, and newline to determine the proper indentation.

### Error Location:
The bug likely occurs due to incorrect handling of the indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent, especially with tab characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect handling of the indentation for comments after a dedent using tabs. This issue leads to misaligned comments in the formatted output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are properly aligned even after dedents with tabs. This may involve adjusting the logic of how indentation is calculated and maintained within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted for tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters ('\t') has been adjusted to increment the `current_column` by the appropriate number of spaces (4 spaces for a tab in Python). This adjustment ensures that comments align properly even after a dedent with tabs.

By updating the function as shown, the bug related to indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent should be fixed, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post.
