## Analysis:
This buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a provided column number. The function reads characters one by one from the prefix until it reaches the specified column or encounters a newline character.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if char == '\n':` does not reset `current_line` and `current_column`, which might lead to missing or incorrect line-breaking behavior.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` based on whitespaces and tabs might be incorrect.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function occurs when it encounters a newline character (`'\n'`). It fails to properly handle the newline character, resulting in incomplete or incorrect line processing.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character to start processing a new line.
2. Adjust the logic for updating `current_column` based on whitespace characters to accurately calculate the column offset.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # handle non-empty lines
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, when encountering a newline character, we check if the current line is non-empty before appending it to the `lines` list. Additionally, we reset `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately to handle a new line. This ensures correct processing and partial consumption of the prefix string.
