## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column number, treating spaces and tabs differently for column calculation. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is a newline (`char == '\n'`) is improperly handled.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` when encountering a newline is not correct.
3. The logic for updating `current_column` when encountering tabs (`'\t'`) is not accounting for potential inconsistencies.

## Explanation of the Bug:
When the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`), it resets the `current_column` to 0. However, this is inconsistent with the behavior of tabs (`'\t'`), which are supposed to increment the `current_column` by 4. This inconsistency leads to incorrect column calculations and an unexpected behavior when processing newlines.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Separate the handling of newline character (`'\n'`) and tab character (`'\t'`) to ensure proper column calculation for each case.
2. Correctly update the `current_column` value when encountering newline and tab characters to maintain consistent behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update current_column by 4 for each tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column to 0 for each newline character
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version separates the handling of newline and tab characters and updates the `current_column` appropriately for each case. Additionally, it ensures that the column calculation is consistent and correct for different types of characters encountered in the prefix string.
