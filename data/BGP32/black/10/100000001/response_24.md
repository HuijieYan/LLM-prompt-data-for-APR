The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a specific column position is reached, and return the consumed part and the remaining string. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` checks if the current line is not empty and if the current column position is less than the target column. However, the condition should be checking if the length of the current column is less than the target column.

2. The `res` variable is not updated within the condition that checks if the column condition is met. This results in returning an empty string instead of the consumed part of the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the column comparison condition and update the `res` variable within the if condition. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line) < column: # Corrected condition
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line # Updated res
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version should now properly consume the prefix string up to the specified column position and return the consumed part along with the remaining string.
