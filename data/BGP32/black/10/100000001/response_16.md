The potential error in the buggy function lies in the logic related to handling newline characters ('\n'). The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` count when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect behavior when parsing the prefix.

The bug causes the function to not properly handle cases where newline characters are encountered, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption and line tracking. As a result, the function may fail to return the correct sliced prefix and lines.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to newline characters to reset the `current_column` count to 0 when encountering a newline character. This ensures that the function accurately tracks the column position within the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0  # Reset the column count when encountering newline
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for newline characters that resets the `current_column` count to 0 when encountering a newline character. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly handles newline characters and updates the line tracking and prefix consumption accordingly.
