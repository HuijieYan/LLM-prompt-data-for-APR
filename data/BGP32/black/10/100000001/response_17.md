## Analyzing the buggy function:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to process a given prefix string up to a certain column. It has logic to handle whitespace characters (' ', '\t') and newline characters ('\n') while keeping track of the column position.

## Potential error locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is a newline ('\n') might not be correctly working as intended.
2. The logic for appending `current_line` to `lines` might be inconsistent and could lead to incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function arises from the incorrect handling of the newline character '\n'. The function may skip over lines that are empty or have only whitespace characters, causing the lines not to be recorded properly.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters and processes lines within the prefix correctly, even if they are empty or contain only whitespace characters.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
1. We include the newline character '\n' in the case when checking if the current line meets the column requirement.
2. We handle newline characters more consistently, ensuring lines are processed correctly even if they are empty or have only whitespace characters.
