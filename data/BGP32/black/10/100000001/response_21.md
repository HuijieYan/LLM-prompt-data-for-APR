### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a specified column while considering tab and newline characters for indentation. However, there is a logical error in the function that causes it to prematurely stop consuming the prefix.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if wait_for_nl:` is incorrectly structured and may prevent the prefix from being fully consumed.
2. The logic for checking the indent completion with `wait_for_nl = True` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function occurs when it encounters a newline character in the middle of processing the prefix. This causes the function to exit prematurely without consuming the complete prefix up to the specified column.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters and correctly processes the prefix up to the specified column without prematurely exiting the loop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""  # reset current_line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I made the following changes:
1. Added `current_line` to the `res` to ensure that the newline character is not missed during the processing.
2. Reset `current_line` to an empty string when encountering a newline character, ensuring that the full prefix is consumed correctly.
3. Updated the logic to handle the indent completion and newline characters properly.
