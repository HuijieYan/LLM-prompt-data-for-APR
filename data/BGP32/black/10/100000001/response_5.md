## Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a portion of text up to a specific column position while handling tabs, spaces, and newlines.
2. The function keeps track of the lines read so far.
3. The bug seems to be related to returning the wrongly processed result due to an incorrect condition check and handling.
4. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly consumes and processes characters at `if char == '\n':` block causing it not to consider lines that have already been stripped.
5. The function should correctly detect when a new line should be considered based on the indentation level.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Improper handling at the `if char == '\n':` block may cause the function to skip non-empty lines.
2. Incomplete handling of spaces and tabs may result in incorrect column counting.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the function wrongly skips over lines and does not handle them correctly, leading to an incorrect result when consuming the prefix text.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the condition at `if char == '\n':` to ensure that the correct behavior is achieved when encountering newline characters.
2. Adjust the handling of spaces and tabs to correctly calculate the column position.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the corrected version, the function correctly handles newlines, spaces, tabs, and column tracking to ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed up to the specified column.
