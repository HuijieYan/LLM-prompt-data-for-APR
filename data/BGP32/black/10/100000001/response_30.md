## Analysis:
This function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a specific column and return the consumed part along with the remaining unparsed part. The bug likely lies within the logic involving `wait_for_nl`, as it controls the behavior of the function based on the encountered characters.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if `wait_for_nl` is True needs to be adjusted to catch cases where the last line is not ending with a newline character.
2. The logic involving `current_column` might have issues in correctly counting the number of spaces or tabs.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the condition where the last line in the prefix does not end with a newline character, causing it to skip the implementation for checking the column and returning incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately determines the consumed prefix up to the specified column, even if the last line does not end with a newline character. Adjusting the logic around `wait_for_nl` and `current_column` calculation can help resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' or len(prefix) == len(current_line):
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the condition in the `if wait_for_nl` block has been adjusted to check if the current character is '\n' or if the loop has reached the end of the prefix. This change ensures that the function correctly handles the last line of the prefix even if it does not end with a newline character, fixing the bug.
