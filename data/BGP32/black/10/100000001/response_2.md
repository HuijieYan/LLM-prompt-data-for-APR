### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column. It processes the prefix character by character, considering spaces, tabs, and newlines. The function should return a partially consumed prefix string up to the specified column and the remaining unparsed characters.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The condition for checking if char is a newline character is not correctly nested within the `if` statements.
2. The check for the column value seems incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`). In the current implementation, the condition for handling newline characters is not properly nested within the `if` statements. As a result, the function does not behave as intended when a newline character is encountered, leading to incorrect parsing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly nest the condition for newline characters within the `if` statements to ensure correct handling.
2. Adjust the logic of checking the column value to align with the intended functionality of the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking newline characters is properly nested within the `if` statements, and the logic for checking the column value has been adjusted to handle the correct comparison.
