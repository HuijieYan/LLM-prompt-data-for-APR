## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to split a given `prefix` string into two parts based on a specified `column` value. It processes each character in the `prefix` string to determine the split point.

## Identified Errors:
1. The condition to check if the current character is a newline (`\n`) is incorrect. It should reset `current_line` to an empty string and `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character. Instead, it is being used to detect the end of the indentation and continues appending characters.
2. The condition to check if the current character is whitespace should only increment the `current_column` accordingly. It should not be a trigger for further actions.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle newlines, resulting in combining lines that should be separate. This leads to incorrect splitting of the `prefix` string, affecting the result.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Reset `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character.
2. Update conditions related to newline characters for accurate handling.
3. Remove inappropriate actions triggered by whitespace characters.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 3
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the identified issues and should now correctly split the `prefix` string based on the specified `column` value.
