## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It iterates over the prefix string character by character, determining the number of spaces/tabs and identifying when to stop based on newline characters. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may lead to incorrect behavior:

1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` may not correctly check if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the desired column.
2. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) and calculating the column position might not be accurate.
3. The handling of newline characters (`\n`) and resetting the current column might not be optimal.
4. Issues related to accumulation and handling of lines could lead to partial consumption errors.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling and tracking of the current column position and line accumulation. The function may terminate too early or create incorrect substring slices due to these issues.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for tracking the current column position accurately.
2. Ensure correct handling of tab characters (`\t`) and newline characters (`\n`).
3. Verify the conditions for determining when to stop consuming the prefix are correct.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column > column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version improves the handling of columns, tab characters, newline characters, and determines when to stop consuming the prefix based on the given column position.
