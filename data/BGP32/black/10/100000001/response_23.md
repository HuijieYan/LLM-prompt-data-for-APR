## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string until a specified column number is reached. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect output. 

## Potential Errors:
1. On line 15, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` checks if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the specified column. However, the `strip()` method removes white spaces, tabs, and new lines. This could lead to incorrect calculation of the current column number.

2. On lines 18-20, the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` may not trigger as intended when encountering special characters like tabs or new lines. This could lead to incorrect counting of columns and cause the function to return incorrect results.

## Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug in the function is the incorrect logic for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when encountering special characters like tabs or new lines. This causes the function to improperly handle these characters and incorrectly track the current column number.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, the logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` needs to be revised to properly handle special characters like tabs or new lines. Additionally, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` should be revised to accurately calculate the current column number.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the corrected version, the conditions for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` have been adjusted to properly handle tabs and new lines. Additionally, the `strip()` method on line 15 has been replaced with `rstrip()` to only remove trailing white spaces and ensure accurate column counting.
