### Analysis:
This function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from the given prefix until a certain column is reached. It splits the consumed characters into lines based on newline characters and checks if the column condition is met for each line.

### Identified Errors:
1. In the condition where `wait_for_nl` is `True` and the current character is a newline character, the logic inside the if block might not handle the case correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character after waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl = True`). The current implementation does not handle this case properly, resulting in incorrect processing of the lines and columns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character in the `wait_for_nl` condition, the processing of lines and columns is done correctly. Additionally, we should reset the `wait_for_nl` flag and other relevant variables to handle the next line correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the corrected function, the handling of newline character when `wait_for_nl` is `True` has been fixed. Now, when encountering a newline character in that state, it checks if the column condition is met, processes the line correctly, and resets the relevant variables for the next line.
