Buggy Function Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a specific column.
- It iterates over each character in the prefix string, building up lines until it encounters a newline character.
- The function tracks the current line, column, and waits for a newline character to determine when to stop consuming characters.
- It then returns the consumed prefix up to the specified column along with the remaining prefix.

Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of newline characters and updating `current_column` appropriately.
2. Detecting the condition to check if a line is required based on the column.
3. Building up the lines list and ensuring proper slicing of the remaining prefix.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when determining if a line should be added based on the `column` value. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is not correctly handling the case where a line should be added but the column condition is not met due to whitespace characters.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for deciding when to add a line to correctly consider the whitespace characters. Additionally, we should refactor the logic to properly handle the consumption of the prefix string and updating the `current_column` value.

Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:  # Include lines up to and including specified column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the corrected version, the condition `if current_column <= column` is updated to include lines up to and including the specified column. The handling of characters and newlines is restructured to properly consume the prefix string while considering the column value.
