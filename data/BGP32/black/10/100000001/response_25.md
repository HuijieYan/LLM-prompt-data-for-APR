## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix up to a certain column position. The function accumulates characters until it reaches the specified column or encounters a new line, at which point it returns the consumed prefix and the remaining unparsed part of the prefix.

## Identified Errors:
1. The primary error in the function is that once a complete line is consumed, it is not being cleared appropriately, leading to incorrect accumulations within `lines`.
2. The logic for resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a new line is not properly handled.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly resetting the `current_line` buffer when a new line is encountered, causing the accumulation to continue without proper separation between lines. This leads to incorrect parsing of the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current_line` variable is properly handled and reset when a new line is encountered. Additionally, the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be appropriately updated to control the flow within the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""  # Clear the current line buffer
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, each time a new line character is encountered, the `current_line` buffer is cleared, and the `wait_for_nl` flag is appropriately updated to ensure correct flow control within the function.
