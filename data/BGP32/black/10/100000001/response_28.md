## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. It reads characters from the prefix string, processes whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines), and checks if the column limit is reached before a newline character.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the column limit is reached before the newline character might not be correctly implemented.
2. The handling of the initial `wait_for_nl` state might cause unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in this function arises due to the incorrect processing of the current line and column count. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is not effectively applied, potentially leading to an incorrect result. Additionally, the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag may cause the function to skip certain characters in the prefix.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should accurately track the current column count and compare it against the specified column. Proper management of the `wait_for_nl` flag is crucial to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix characters.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of newlines and the related conditions have been adjusted to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column without skipping any characters. Additionally, the check for an unexpected empty line has been improved to manage the current column count appropriately.
