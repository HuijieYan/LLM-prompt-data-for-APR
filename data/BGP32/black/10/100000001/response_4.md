## Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the input `prefix` string based on the `column` parameter.
- The current implementation has a bug where it does not correctly handle the case when the `current_column` is less than the specified `column`.
- The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is not correctly checking the column position before returning the result.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` could be the cause of the bug.
- In the case of an unexpected empty line (char == '\n'), the function should not reset `current_column`.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises when the function encounters a line that should be skipped because the current_column is less than the specified column. The logic to handle this scenario is incorrect, resulting in an incorrect partially consumed `prefix`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust how we handle the skipping of lines that do not meet the column requirement. This can be done by revising the conditional check that determines when to return the result.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False  # Do not reset column

        if current_column >= column:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition for determining when to return the result has been adjusted to check the column position before deciding to skip or include the line in the result. Additionally, the handling of the unexpected empty line has been modified to ensure that the `current_column` is not reset unnecessarily.
