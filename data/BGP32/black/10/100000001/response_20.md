## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column length. However, there are possible issues in the logic of the function that could result in incorrect behavior.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `current_column < column` might not work as intended due to the logic in the function.
2. Checking for an empty line using `current_line.strip()` may not address all cases of empty lines correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function arises from the incorrect handling of lines, columns, and characters in the prefix string. The logic for tracking the column length and handling new lines is not properly implemented, leading to potential errors in identifying the correct prefix substring.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for tracking the column length, recognizing new lines accurately, and identifying the correct substring to return.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- I adjusted the condition `current_column <= column` to ensure it correctly handles the specified column limit.
- Handled the case of a new line to properly update the lines list and reset the line and column variables.

This corrected version should address the issues present in the original buggy function.
