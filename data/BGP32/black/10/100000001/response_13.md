## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on the given column position. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect behavior or bugs:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not properly handle scenarios where the current line is empty.
2. The line `res = ''.join(lines)` seems unnecessary and may not accurately represent the collected lines.
3. The use of `wait_for_nl` might not reset correctly in all cases, causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a situation where there is an unexpected empty line within the prefix. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the current column position and can result in incorrect output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure proper handling of unexpected empty lines and reset the `wait_for_nl` flag appropriately. Additionally, we should adjust the condition for consuming lines to handle empty lines correctly.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip():
                    current_column = 0
                    current_line = ""
                    continue
                
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to handle unexpected empty lines when encountered. Additionally, the logic for resetting `wait_for_nl` and handling empty lines has been adjusted to ensure correct behavior when consuming the prefix.
