## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. The function iterates over the characters in the input `prefix` string, with the goal of trimming the prefix based on the specified column. The function keeps track of the current line, current column position, and whether it needs to wait for a new line.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is a newline character is incorrect.
2. Handling of potential indentation with spaces and tabs might lead to incorrect column count calculations.
3. The logic for appending lines is flawed, leading to potential issues in returning the correct result.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the provided function stems from mismanagement of newline characters and inconsistent handling of whitespace characters. The condition to check for a newline character and reset the column is not correctly implemented, potentially causing incorrect trimming of the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Refine the condition for detecting newline characters to properly reset the column count and handle empty lines.
2. Adjust the logic for calculating the column based on spaces and tabs to ensure accurate counting.
3. Correctly append lines to the `lines` list to prepare for returning the final result.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and provides a more robust implementation for partially consuming the prefix based on the specified column value.
