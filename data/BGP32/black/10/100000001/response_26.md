## Analysis of the buggy function:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix string until a certain column is reached.
- It keeps track of the current line being constructed and the current column position.
- There is a check for `wait_for_nl` indicating whether to expect a new line character.
- The function should return the consumed portion of the prefix string up to the specified column, along with the remaining part of the prefix.

## Potential error locations:
- The condition for ending the indent (`wait_for_nl = True`) might not be triggered correctly.
- The condition for checking if the current line is empty before returning might not be working as intended.

## Cause of the bug:
- The bug in the function arises from the condition under which the function decides to return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.
- When the indent is supposed to be terminated, the handling is not correct, leading to erroneous output.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Make sure that the condition for ending the indent (setting `wait_for_nl = True`) occurs when necessary.
2. Ensure that the function correctly distinguishes between a newline character that terminates the current line and a newline character that replaces the consumed prefix.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the section for handling newline characters was modified to ensure correct behavior when ending the indent and when terminating the current line.
