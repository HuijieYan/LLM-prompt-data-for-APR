## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column in Python code. The function maintains a state to keep track of the current line being built and the current column number within that line. The function also handles indentation using spaces and tabs to calculate the column number.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The `lines` list is not being properly updated.
2. The condition for checking the column number is incorrect.
3. The flow control when encountering a newline character seems unclear.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character within the prefix but fails to handle it correctly. As a result, it does not properly track the current column number and fails to update the lines list, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Bug-Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that every time a newline character is encountered, the function correctly updates the lines list and resets the current_line and current_column variables. Additionally, the logic for handling indentation with spaces and tabs needs to be adjusted to accurately calculate the column number.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling newline characters has been modified to correctly update the lines list and reset the current_line and current_column variables. The functions for handling spaces, tabs, and other characters have also been adjusted to ensure accurate column tracking.
