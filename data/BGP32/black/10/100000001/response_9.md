The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column. However, there are certain issues present in the function, leading to incorrect behavior:

1. The `current_line` is not reset after a newline character is encountered, which may result in incorrect line concatenation.
2. The logic for handling lines that do not match the specified column is flawed, as it does not consider certain conditions properly.
3. The termination condition for the loop may not always account for all cases.

To fix the bug in the function, we can adjust the logic for handling the prefix consumption and properly concatenating lines based on the specified column.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        elif wait_for_nl:
            pass
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function now properly handles the concatenation of lines and correctly checks for the specified column condition, ultimately fixing the bug in the original `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
