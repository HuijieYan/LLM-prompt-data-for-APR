### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix until a certain column width is reached.
- The function processes each character in the prefix and constructs lines based on the column width.
- There seems to be an issue when waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) where the logic may not reset correctly.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and resetting of variables when encountering a new line may be incorrect.
2. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column could be causing unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function may arise from the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and the logic for resetting variables when encountering a new line. This could lead to incomplete consumption of the prefix or incorrect splitting of lines. The condition for checking the current column against the specified column may also not be working as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for resetting variables when encountering a new line and handling the `wait_for_nl` flag is correct.
2. Double-check the condition for checking the current column against the specified column to ensure it behaves as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Moved the `current_line += char` statement after the `wait_for_nl` check to avoid prematurely appending characters.
2. Corrected the handling of the new line character to reset variables and append the line correctly.
3. Removed redundant else branches and streamlined the logic based on character type.

This corrected version should address the issues in the buggy function and behave as intended, correctly consuming the prefix until the specified column width.
