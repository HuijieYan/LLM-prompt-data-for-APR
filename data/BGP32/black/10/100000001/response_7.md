## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a given prefix until a specific column number is reached. However, there are some errors in the logic of the function that result in incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if wait_for_nl:` might not be correctly handling the situation where a newline character ('\n') is encountered when `wait_for_nl` is True.
2. The calculation of `current_column` when encountering newline characters ('\n') may not be resetting the column count correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in this function occurs when a newline character is encountered while waiting for a newline (when `wait_for_nl` is True). The current logic fails to reset the column count correctly and does not handle the situation when a newline character appears in the middle of a line.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters when encountered. The column count should be reset properly when a newline character is found, and the logic for waiting for a newline should be adjusted to correctly handle such situations.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # reset column count and continue adding characters
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column count on encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
