## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix of text based on a given column. It reads characters from the prefix and tries to split them into lines based on indentation levels and line breaks. The function has logic to handle spaces, tabs, and newlines to determine when to create a new line.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters: The function increments the current column by 4 when encountering a tab character. This assumption might not be correct if the tab width is different.
2. Incorrectly checking current column against the target column: The condition `current_column < column` might not accurately compare the current position in the line with the desired target column.
3. Logic to preserve indentation: The function uses `wait_for_nl` flag to determine when to create a new line. This logic might not be handling all cases correctly, leading to incorrect line splitting.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of tab characters contributing to the miscalculation of the `current_column`, potentially leading to incorrect line splitting.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the tab width assumption to a more generic value or consider calculating the tab width dynamically.
2. Review the logical conditions for creating new lines and ensure they cover all necessary cases for correct line splitting.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Consider changing tab width to a generic value
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if line should be added based on current_column
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In the corrected version, I made the tab calculation more generic by incrementing the `current_column` by 1 when encountering a tab character. I also adjusted the conditional logic for creating new lines to ensure that the target column is correctly compared with the current position.
