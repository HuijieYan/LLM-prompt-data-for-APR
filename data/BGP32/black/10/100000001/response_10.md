## Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to process a prefix string until a certain column position is reached.
- The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a newline character.
- It appends characters to the current line until a condition is met to process the line(s).

## Bug:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) and is in a state of waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl` is True).
- The code inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block does not correctly handle the newline condition, causing incorrect line processing.
- This bug results in the function not correctly consuming the prefix up to the specified column position.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- When encountering a newline character (`\n`) while waiting for a newline in `_partially_consume_prefix`, the function should reset the current line and wait state.
- The logic for handling newlines needs to be adjusted to ensure correct processing of lines and columns.
- The logic for appending lines to the `lines` list should be updated to accurately capture the content until the specified column position.

## Correction:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = len(current_line)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

## Corrected Version:
- The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function ensures that the prefix is appropriately consumed up to the specified column position.
- The logic inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block has been modified to handle newline characters correctly and reset the state if necessary.
- The correction ensures that the function processes the prefix accurately and returns the correct results.
