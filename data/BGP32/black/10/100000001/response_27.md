## Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function takes a `prefix` string and a `column` integer as input.
- It appears to be intended to extract lines from the `prefix` string up to a certain number of characters indicated by the `column` value.
- The function uses `current_line` to build the current line being processed.
- The function uses `lines` to store the lines that have reached the desired character count.
- There seems to be a logical error in handling the newline characters to determine the end of a line.

## Bugs:
1. The condition `if wait_for_nl:` should not be inside the loop that processes each character.
2. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is used incorrectly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic for detecting when a line exceeds the desired character count is flawed. This leads to incorrect processing and splitting of lines.

## Strategy for Fixing:
1. Move the `if wait_for_nl:` condition outside the loop that processes each character.
2. Adjust the condition `if current_column < column` to properly check for the desired character count.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if len(current_line) > column:
                break
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if len(current_line) > column:
                    break
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
