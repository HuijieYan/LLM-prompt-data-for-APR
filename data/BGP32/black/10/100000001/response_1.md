## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column position. It processes characters in the input prefix string, keeping track of the current line, current column, and detecting newline characters to handle line breaks.

## Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` may not accurately check if the condition for consuming the prefix up to a specific column is met.
2. Handling of the newline character (`\n`) and resetting `current_column` and `current_line` needs to be reviewed.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises from incorrect handling of the newline character and column tracking, leading to the function not correctly consuming the prefix up to the specified column limit.

## Fixing Strategy:
1. Adjust the condition for consuming the prefix up to a specific column by reconsidering how newline characters affect the consumption.
2. Ensure proper resetting of `current_column` and `current_line` when encountering newline characters.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition `current_column <= column` before returning the consumed prefix is adjusted to ensure correct handling up to and including the specified column. Also, the newline character case is modified to correctly reset the line and column values.
