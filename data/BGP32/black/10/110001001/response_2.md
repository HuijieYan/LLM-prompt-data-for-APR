### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` when encountering a non-space, non-tab character. This causes premature completion of the current line, resulting in incorrect handling of the indentation level and skipping content.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` should be adjusted. This can be achieved by changing the condition to check for spaces or tabs instead of non-space, non-tab characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = char not in [' ', '\t']
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
