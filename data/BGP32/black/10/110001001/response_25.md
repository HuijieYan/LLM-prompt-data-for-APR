The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where the code checks whether to consume the prefix or not. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the current line is not empty but the column value is already reached. This results in skipping the non-empty line when it should have been included in the consumed prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where we check if the current line is non-empty and the column limit has been reached. If this condition is met, we need to append the current line to `lines` before resetting `current_line` and adjusting `current_column`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the non-empty line is included in the consumed prefix even if the column limit has been reached.
