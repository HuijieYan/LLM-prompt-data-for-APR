The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the input prefix based on the specified column position. The main issue in the function causing incorrect behavior is related to the handling of indentation levels and the wait_for_nl flag.

After analyzing the function and the provided runtime values, the bug can be identified in the condition where the function checks if the current column is less than the specified column; this check is causing unexpected behavior when the column is larger or equal to the specified value.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the if condition where the current column is compared with the specified column value. We should also handle cases where the specified column is larger or equal to the current column correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By making the adjustments to the condition that checks the column position in the corrected function, we ensure that the prefix is correctly consumed based on the specified column value without skipping or including extra characters.
