### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the conditional check for `wait_for_nl` inside the loop. When `wait_for_nl` is True, the function only resets the `current_line` and `current_column` without appending the `current_line` to the `lines` list. This results in missing content as the function keeps track of the consumption state incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `wait_for_nl` is True, the function appends the `current_line` to the `lines` list before resetting `current_line` and `current_column`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `current_line` is properly appended to `lines` when `wait_for_nl` is True, fixing the bug causing missing content in the output.
