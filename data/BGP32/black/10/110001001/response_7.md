### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value, splitting the prefix string into lines based on newline characters while accounting for spaces and tabs. However, the function has issues with correctly updating the variables like `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function fails to handle the `'\n'` character correctly when `wait_for_nl` is True, resulting in the incorrect final `res` value.
2. In Case 3, when processing the `'\t'` character, the function fails to update the `current_column` correctly, resulting in an incorrect value.
3. In Case 5, the function inaccurately handles the space character `' '` causing issues with the final `lines` list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bugs identified, the following modifications can be made:
1. Update the condition for handling newline characters in Case 1 to accurately split lines when `wait_for_nl` is True.
2. Correct the handling of the tab character `'\t'` in Case 3 to properly update the `current_column`.
3. Adjust the handling of space character `' '` in Case 5 to ensure correct line splitting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the suggested corrections, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should now handle the prefix string correctly and provide the expected output based on the specified column value.
