Based on the input parameters and the variables' values provided for each case, we can identify the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) in the input prefix. It incorrectly handles the calculation of `current_column` and the checking of `wait_for_nl`. This leads to incorrect line processing and results in a wrong substring returned.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling newline characters and resetting the `current_column` correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version aligns the logic for `current_column` adjustment and `wait_for_nl` handling to properly identify the end of a line and reset the variables accordingly. The new version should now handle the newline characters correctly and return the expected substrings.
