### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to process a given prefix string while considering indentation levels and line breaks. The function accumulates characters into `current_line`, updates the `current_column` based on tabs and spaces, and handles scenarios where it needs to wait for a new line to proceed. The bug seems to manifest in incorrect handling of conditions related to the `wait_for_nl` flag.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the function encounters a new line character (`'\n'`) while `wait_for_nl` is set to true. In such cases, the function incorrectly checks for a condition related to the `column` constraint, leading to incorrect processing or omission of characters. This results in the function returning an incorrect `res` value and possibly incorrectly processed prefix.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the function should accurately handle the case when encountering a new line character while waiting to complete the indentation. The condition for checking if the current line satisfies the column constraint should be moved out of the inner `if char == '\n'` block and placed after the `wait_for_nl` check. This adjustment ensures proper handling of the column constraint before starting a new line within the prefix string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle the indentation and new line conditions accurately, ensuring correct processing of the prefix string based on the given column constraint.
