### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. It accumulates lines based on whitespace characters and newlines. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles newlines and column tracking.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character, resetting the `current_column` to 0. This behavior disrupts the column tracking logic, causing incorrect line accumulation. 

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located at the handling of newline characters, specifically when `char == '\n'`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `current_column` when encountering a newline should be revised. Instead of resetting the column count, it should be retained and adjusted accordingly based on the line content.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = current_line.strip()
            if current_line and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is properly adjusted when encountering newlines, allowing correct accumulation of lines based on the specified column limit.
