### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column value. The function is supposed to iterate through the characters in the prefix, handling spaces, tabs, and newlines to determine where to split the prefix based on the provided column value.

However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
1. The logic for updating the `current_column` based on spaces and tabs seems incorrect.
2. The handling of newlines and when to reset the `current_column` is flawed.
3. The condition to append lines and reset counters after encountering a newline character is not capturing all cases correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
1. Adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` based on spaces and tabs to accurately track the current position.
2. Update the handling of newlines to correctly reset the `current_column`.
3. Refine the condition to append lines and reset counters after encountering a newline character to cover all scenarios correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False

            current_line += char
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for updating the `current_column`, fixes the handling of newlines, and corrects the condition to correctly split the prefix based on the provided column value.
