### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to handle the case where the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect. The function is returning the wrong results because it does not correctly identify when to stop consuming characters from the prefix.

In each case, the function fails to correctly handle the situation where the current column is less than the specified column. This results in an incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition that checks if the current column is less than the specified column and the logic to resume consuming characters after meeting the specified condition. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version includes an additional check when encountering a newline character to handle the case where the current column is less than the specified column. It correctly identifies when to stop consuming characters from the prefix and returns the expected results.
