### Bug Fix

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the case when a non-empty line is encountered but the column count is less than the specified column parameter. The logic to check for this condition and return the result is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the function to correctly handle the condition where the column count is less than the specified column parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By moving the lines appending logic before the condition check for the column count, we ensure that the correct line is appended to the results before checking the column count condition. This fixes the bug in the function.
