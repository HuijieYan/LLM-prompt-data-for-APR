### Analysis
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the `prefix` string up to a certain `column` value, taking into account different types of characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.
- The function initializes variables like `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.
- The logic is supposed to accumulate characters from `prefix` until reaching the desired column position. Once this position is reached, the function should return the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining part.
- The bugs may be related to incorrect accumulation of lines and handling of column positions.

### Bugs and Causes
1. In case 1, the condition for checking if the current line is not empty and if the column is less than the desired column is flawed. It doesn't properly handle the case where a line might consist of spaces followed by a comment and still be within the specified column range. This results in incorrect splitting of the prefix.
2. The logic for handling `\n` characters seems incorrect as it resets the column position but doesn't handle empty lines properly, causing unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
1. Fix the condition for checking the column position and the content of the line before splitting the prefix.
2. Properly handle the cases when encountering newline characters to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':              
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
          
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column if the line is not empty
            if current_line.strip():
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        else:
            # Update state for the next line
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By fixing the conditions related to handling the column position and newline characters, the corrected version should now accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column position.
