### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached, splitting the consumed part and remaining part of the prefix.
- The function keeps track of the current line, current column position, and whether it's waiting for a newline character.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of newline characters and calculating the column positions.

### Issue:
1. The function does not properly handle cases where the current line reaches the specified column limit while waiting for a newline character. It fails to return the correct consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix.
2. In some cases, the handling of tab characters for column increment is incorrect.

### Fix:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle cases where the column limit is reached while waiting for a newline character. Adjust the return values accordingly.
2. Ensure that the column position is updated correctly when encountering tab characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_column >= column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures the proper handling of column limits and newline characters within the prefix string.
