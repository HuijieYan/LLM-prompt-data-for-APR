### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix string up to a specified column position. It keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether it is waiting for a new line character. The bug seems to be related to handling indentation and newline characters incorrectly, causing issues with tracking the columns.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, when the function encounters a newline character (`char == '\n'`) and `wait_for_nl` is True, it should check if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the specified column value. However, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` checks for the strip of the current line, which still contains the newline character. This check fails to respect the indentation and strip the newline effectively.
   
2. In Case 3, a similar issue arises. Even though the function handles tabs correctly, when updating the `current_column` with tab characters (`char == '\t'`), it should add 4 to the `current_column` value. However, there is inconsistency in updating the `current_column` throughout the function, leading to incorrect column tracking. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the conditions for identifying the end of the indentation and newline characters. Additionally, consistent updating and handling of the `current_column` value based on tab characters is crucial for proper indentation tracking.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update the current_column value correctly
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Update the condition to handle indentation correctly
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column position, considering tabs and spaces correctly.
