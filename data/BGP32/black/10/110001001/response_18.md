### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value. However, the logic inside the function seems to have some issues when handling whitespace characters and newline characters.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline, resulting in premature splitting of the lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters.
2. Ensure that the concatenation of the lines is done correctly.
3. Update the current_column value based on the whitespace characters encountered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue with handling newline characters and properly tracks the current_column value while consuming the prefix string.
