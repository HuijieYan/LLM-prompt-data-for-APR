### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where the code checks if `current_column < column` while waiting for a new line character. If the condition is true, the function returns a result that is missing the remaining characters in the prefix. This results in incorrect outputs and the function not properly consuming the prefix.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` needs to be adjusted. Instead of checking if `current_column < column`, it should check if `len(current_line) <= column`. This change ensures that the function consumes the full prefix up to the specified column before returning the result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column before returning the result.
