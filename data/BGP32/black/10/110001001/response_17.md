### Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of the `prefix` string until a certain `column` width is reached or a new line character is encountered. The function has a logic error in determining when to return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. 

The bug occurs when the condition to return the consumed prefix is checked after encountering a new line character. This leads to incorrect behavior as the consumed prefix is returned before reaching the desired column width. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to check if the current column width exceeds the desired `column` before returning the consumed prefix. This ensures that the function properly consumes the prefix until the specified column width or a new line character is encountered.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n' or current_column >= column:
            if current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the logic in the above corrected version, the function now properly consumes the prefix until reaching the specified column width or encountering a new line character before returning the consumed and remaining prefix.
