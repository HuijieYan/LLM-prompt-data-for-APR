The bug in the provided function seems to be related to how the function tracks the current column position and when it should split the prefix string correctly.

In the given cases, the function fails to correctly handle cases where the indentation level changes in the middle of the prefix string. This is due to the `wait_for_nl` flag not being set appropriately when encountering whitespace characters like spaces or tabs.

To fix the bug, the function should set `wait_for_nl` to True when a non-whitespace character is encountered after an indentation level. This will signal that the current line's indentation is finished and it should wait for a new line character before continuing.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug and properly handle the cases outlined above.
