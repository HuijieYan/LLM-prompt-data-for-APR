### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, taking into account indentation levels. From the runtime values and types provided, it seems the function is not correctly handling the cases where the column condition is met, appending lines accordingly.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided runtime scenarios, there is inconsistency in handling the `wait_for_nl` condition when a newline character is encountered. This inconsistency causes issues in properly determining when to append lines and reset the current line and column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of `wait_for_nl` is consistent and correctly resets the current line and column values to proceed with appending lines. Additionally, we should make adjustments in the handling of space and tab characters to accurately update the current column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
