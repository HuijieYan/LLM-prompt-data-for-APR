The buggy function (_partially_consume_prefix) is designed to consume a given prefix up to a certain column limit. However, there are issues with the implementation that result in incorrect behavior.

#### Identified issues:
1. When a character other than space or tab is encountered, the function sets wait_for_nl to True, indicating that it is waiting for a new line to finish indentation. However, if a new line character is immediately encountered, it resets current_column to 0 without checking if the current line should be appended or not.
2. The function does not handle the case where the prefix finishes with an incomplete line waiting for a newline character to reach the desired column.
3. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` in line 17 is incorrect. It should compare `current_column` with the input parameter `column` and return the result.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to properly handle the case when a new line character is encountered after setting wait_for_nl to True.
2. Add a check to handle cases where the prefix ends with an incomplete line that needs to be appended.
3. Update the comparison in line 17 to compare `current_column` with the input parameter `column`.
4. Refactor the code for improved readability and maintainability.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version addresses the identified issues and should now properly consume the prefix up to the specified column.
