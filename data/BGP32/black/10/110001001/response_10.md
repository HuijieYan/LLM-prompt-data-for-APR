The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels and new lines. The function is designed to partially consume the prefix until a certain indentation level is reached based on the `column` parameter.

The issue arises when handling the `wait_for_nl` condition. When encountering a new line after waiting for it, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 regardless of the actual indentation level reached.

To fix this bug, we need to properly update the `current_column` to reflect the correct indentation level when a new line is encountered. We should reset the `current_line` and `current_column` only if the indentation level is less than the specified `column`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                # Reset the current_column only if the indentation level is less than the specified column
                if current_column < column:
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current_column only if the indentation level is less than the specified column
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is reset to 0 only if the actual indentation level is less than the specified `column`. This should address the bug and handle the indentation levels correctly.
