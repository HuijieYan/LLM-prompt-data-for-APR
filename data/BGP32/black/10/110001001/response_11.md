### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume characters from a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, there are issues in handling the cases with spaces, tabs, and newline characters correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Issue:
1. In the first case, the condition `if wait_for_nl:` is not reset to False after processing a newline character. This causes the function to always wait for a newline character, resulting in an incorrect output.
2. In the second case, the function does not handle the case of an empty prefix string correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. In the third case, the logic for handling tabs is incorrect, causing the function to miscalculate the current column.
4. In the fourth case, the function fails to account for an empty prefix string and returns an incorrect output.
5. In the fifth case, the function does not handle spaces correctly, resulting in the incorrect calculation of the current column.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to False after processing a newline character to handle different lines properly.
2. Check for an empty prefix string at the beginning of the function and return the appropriate values.
3. Correctly handle the calculation of the current column when encountering tabs.
4. Ensure that the function handles cases with an empty prefix string gracefully.
5. Adjust the handling of spaces to calculate the current column correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    if not prefix:
        return "", ""
    
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By incorporating the suggested fixes, the corrected version should now handle different cases properly and provide the expected output.
