### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string by considering indentation and newlines based on the provided column parameter. However, there are multiple issues that cause the function to fail:

1. The logic for handling indentation and newlines is incorrect.
2. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is flawed.
3. There is a missing condition to handle the case when the prefix string ends before consuming all characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation, newlines, and determining when to stop consuming characters based on the specified column. In some cases, the function fails to correctly update the current_line and lines lists, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for handling indentation, newlines, and character consumption.
2. Ensure that the current column is accurately tracked and compared with the specified column value.
3. Add a condition to handle the case when the prefix string ends before consuming all characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues mentioned above and should now correctly handle indentation and newlines while partially consuming the prefix string based on the specified column.
