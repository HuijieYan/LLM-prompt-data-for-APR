### Analysis:
The current buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on the provided column value. However, the function fails to properly handle the indentation for comments, leading to incorrect output as indicated by the failing test. The function incorrectly processes the indentation for comments after a dedent, causing mismatches in the output.

1. The function fails to correctly adjust the column value when encountering a comment.
2. It does not account for the correct indentation level when dealing with comments.
3. The logic for handling different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) is not effectively managing the prefix consumption.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of comment indentation after a dedent. The function fails to adjust the column value correctly, resulting in incorrect output where comments are not aligned properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This involves adjusting the column value for comment lines and ensuring that comments are correctly aligned with the code. Additionally, the function should handle different types of characters in the prefix string more effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes handling the indentation of comments properly after a dedent, ensuring that comments align correctly with the code. It addresses the issue of incorrect comment indentation and should resolve the failing test case.
