### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to modify and track the indentation of lines within the prefix based on the provided column value. The issue arises when the function encounters a comment line after a dedent.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the condition where `if wait_for_nl:` is True, the function should check the current column against the original column to maintain the correct indentation.
2. The handling of comments within the prefix may be causing the incorrect behavior.
3. When setting `wait_for_nl = True`, it might not cover all necessary indent scenarios.

#### Bug Cause:
The function fails to appropriately handle comments' indentation after a dedent due to the incomplete check on the current column against the initial column value. This leads to incorrect indentation output, causing the test failures reflected in the GitHub issue.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that after dedenting, the comment lines maintain the correct indentation levels.
2. Improve the logic for tracking the indentation levels and resetting the current column when necessary.
3. Correctly implement the condition for `wait_for_nl` to cover all relevant scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # Empty line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if current_column < column and not current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By enhancing the logic for handling comments and ensuring proper tracking of the current indentation level, the corrected function addresses the issue. It should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values as described.
