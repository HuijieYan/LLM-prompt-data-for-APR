### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a specific column value is reached. However, based on the failing test and runtime values, there is an issue with the handling of newlines and maintaining the correct column count.

### Bug Explanation:
- In Case 1: The function fails to correctly handle the newline character when waiting for a newline after a non-space/tab character. Consequently, it incorrectly returns the consumed prefix.
- In Case 3: The function incorrectly assigns the `wait_for_nl` flag. It should be set to `True` when encountering a non-space/tab character, expecting a newline to reset the column count.
- Similar issues occur in other cases where the function fails to reset the column count and properly consume the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that when a non-space/tab character is encountered, the function correctly handles the subsequent newline character.
2. Reset the column count and update the `wait_for_nl` flag appropriately based on the encountered characters.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char.isspace():
            pass
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these changes, the function should appropriately consume the prefix based on the specified column value and handle newlines correctly. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test cases.
