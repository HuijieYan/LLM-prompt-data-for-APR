### Bug Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix text up to a certain column, handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The bug seems to be around handling the newline character (`\n`). The issue encountered in the failing test is due to incorrect handling of the newline character when the comment is encountered at the target column.

The function does not correctly handle the case where a comment is located at the target column, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that when a character causing a line break (in this case, the '\n' character) is encountered while waiting for a newline, the processing correctly handles the comment at the target column. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly checking and handling the condition for the newline character, the corrected function should now properly process the prefix text and handle comments located at the target column, resolving the failing test case and the GitHub issue related to improper indentation manipulation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
