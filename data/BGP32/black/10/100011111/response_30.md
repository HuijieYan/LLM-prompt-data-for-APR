### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle partially consuming a prefix string based on a given column. The function seems to mismanage the indentation level calculation when encountering a comment after dedent in the input prefix. This leads to incorrect handling of the comment's indentation.

Based on the failing tests and runtime values:
- In Case 1, the current behavior results in keeping the comment indented at the original level instead of aligning it with the subsequent code due to an incorrect assumption of indentation level when encountering comments.
- In Case 3, despite consuming the prefix correctly, the handling of the comment causes an incorrect deduction of the column when advancing to the next line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the processing of comments after dedent aligns them correctly with the subsequent code. This involves properly tracking the indentation level, especially when encountering comments, to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag for comments

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Verification:
The corrected version of the function aims to address the indentation handling issue with comments present after a dedent. By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering comments, the function should now properly align comments with the following code. This should resolve the failing test case and align with the expected input/output values.
