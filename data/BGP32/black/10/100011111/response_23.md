### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the mistreatment of spaces and tabs in calculating the indentation levels. In cases where the code contains mixed tabs and spaces, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation levels and interpret the correct column position.

Looking at the provided runtime inputs and expected outputs, there are discrepancies in the calculation of `current_column` based on spaces and tabs encountered. The function erroneously calculates the `current_column` value leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately calculates the indentation level based on both spaces and tabs. Adjust the logic to handle tabs properly and increment the `current_column` accordingly. Additionally, the function needs to accurately detect the end of the indentation for comment lines to maintain the correct alignment.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version accurately handles spaces and tabs, adjusts the indentation level appropriately, and correctly detects the end of the indentation for comment lines. It should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
