### Analysis:
The buggy `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix of characters until a certain column is reached. It handles indentation levels with spaces and tabs to correctly identify the end of the indentation block. The bug occurs when there is a comment line within the indentation block, causing incorrect indentation handling, specifically when reaching the comment line.

### Error Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the conditional check that determines whether to wait for a newline. When encountering a non-space and non-tab character within the indentation block (including a comment), the function mistakenly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, expecting a newline character, causing incorrect behavior by not properly handling the comment line's indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the behavior once the main indentation is finished. By accurately identifying the end of the initial indentation block before a non-space or non-tab character, we can avoid the incorrect behavior related to comment lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif current_column >= column:  # indentation block finished
            if char == ' ' or char == '\t':  # continue normal indentation
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:  # reset and consume this char
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the `elif current_column >= column:` condition to handle the scenario when the initial indentation block is finished, we can properly handle the indentation for comment lines and maintain the correct structure of the input code. This correction should address the bug and ensure proper indentation handling for comments and other content within the code.
