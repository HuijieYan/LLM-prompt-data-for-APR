### Analysis:
The bug seems to occur when there is a comment immediately after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation of such comments. The issue reported on GitHub further confirms that this bug affects tabs and not spaces.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function waits for a new line `'\n'` character before checking column alignment, which results in incorrect behavior when processing comments after dedentations. This leads to the incorrect handling of comments indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the column alignment before consuming the comment line. We should adjust the logic to handle the alignment properly when encountering the comment, ensuring the correct indentation is maintained based on the existing column position.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Check and adjust the indentation for comments after dedent
            if not current_line.strip() and char == '#':
                prefix_spaces = ' ' * (column - current_column)
                current_line += prefix_spaces

            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles the indentation for comments after a dedent by adjusting the current line's spaces based on the desired column alignment. It ensures that comments maintain the correct indentation relative to the code around them, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
