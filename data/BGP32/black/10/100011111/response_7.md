### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation when consuming a prefix string. It processes characters in the prefix string based on certain conditions related to spaces, tabs, and new lines. The function aims to maintain proper indentation levels by considering the input column.

The error message and failing test case indicate a discrepancy in handling comments in the input code. The expected behavior is to maintain the original indentation level of a comment after a dedent. However, the function currently fails to handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent operation.

#### Issues:
1. The function fails to account for preserving comment indentation levels after a dedent operation.
2. Incorrect handling of character tabs results in inappropriate alterations to the comment indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not distinguish between normal indentation and comment lines when processing characters inside the prefix. It lacks the necessary logic to ensure that comments maintain their relative indentation to the code surrounding them.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Introduce a check to differentiate comment lines from code lines so that comments are handled separately for maintaining their relative indentation.
2. Adjust how the function processes tab characters to properly calculate column positions for code and comments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                in_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if in_comment:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version now includes a check to identify comments and ensure that their indentation is maintained correctly. Additionally, the handling of tab characters has been improved to align with the desired column positions. This updated function should now resolve the issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
