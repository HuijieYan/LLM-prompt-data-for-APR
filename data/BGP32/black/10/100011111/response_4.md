### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of the prefix text until a certain column is reached. However, the bug occurs when encountering a comment line that needs to be aligned with the following code block. The function wrongly resets the `current_column` to `0` when encountering a newline, resulting in the incorrect alignment of the comment lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value is maintained correctly, especially when dealing with comment lines. Specifically, the `current_column` should only be reset to `0` when the comment line has indentation less than the target column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the above correction to the function, it should address the issue with comment line indentation, as described in the failing test scenario and the GitHub issue. The function will now maintain the correct column alignment for comments with respect to the following code blocks.
