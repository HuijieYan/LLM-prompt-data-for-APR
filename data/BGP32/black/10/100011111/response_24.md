### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the partially consumed prefix while parsing code.
- The issue arises when encountering comments after dedent (a decrease in indentation level) leading to incorrectly changed indentation for comments.
- The function currently does not correctly handle the indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation, causing the discrepancy seen in the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
- The function fails to consider the correct handling of comments after a dedent operation, leading to a misalignment of the comments compared to the expected output.
- When encountering a comment after dedent, the function does not adjust the comment's indentation level appropriately, resulting in the observed issue.

### Proposed Fix:
To resolve the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation adjustment for comments after a dedent operation. By adjusting the logic within the function to correctly align comments with the corresponding code level after a dedent, the bug can be fixed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # handle comment indentation after dedent
            if lines and lines[-1].lstrip().startswith("#"):
                lines[-1] = lines[-1].lstrip()
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections outlined above, the function should now correctly handle the indentation adjustment for comments after a dedent operation. This corrected version will align comments with the corresponding code level, resolving the issue observed in the failing tests.
