### Bug Explanation:

The current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function fails to preserve the exact indentation of comments when encountering whitespace characters such as tabs or spaces. This leads to incorrect adjustments in the comment indentation during processing. The function incorrectly handles the logic of determining when to append lines to the output and reset the current line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To address this issue, we need to refactor the logic within the function to accurately track the column position and properly handle different types of whitespace characters (\t, ' '). Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are appropriately aligned based on the original indentation level.

### Updated and Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle newline characters more consistently and accurately tracking the column position, this corrected function should ensure that comment indentation in the output remains aligned with its original level.

After integrating this fix, the function is expected to pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation adjustments.
