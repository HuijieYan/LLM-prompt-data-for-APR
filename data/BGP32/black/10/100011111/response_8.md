### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a given prefix until a certain column is reached. However, it fails to handle the indentation properly when encountering comments. The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation in comments after a dedent operation, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment and incorrectly assumes the comment content is part of the prefix to be consumed. This leads to incorrect results when handling comments with different levels of indentation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle comments and ensure they are not incorrectly consumed as part of the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '#':  # Skip comments for indentation
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing this corrected version, the function now skips comments for indentation calculation, ensuring that comments do not influence the prefix consumption process. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation in comments after a dedent operation.
