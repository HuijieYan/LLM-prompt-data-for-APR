## Bug Fix Strategy:
The issue arises when handling indentation changes for comments following a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is currently not correctly handling tab characters, spaces, and new lines, resulting in incorrect indentation. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the character counting when encountering tab characters.

### Correction Plan:
1. Update the logic to ensure that the count for tab characters is consistent with the behavior of the rest of the function.
2. Adjust the handling of tab characters and spaces to correctly track column position.
3. Verify the indentation for comments after a dedent is preserved correctly.

### Correction Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Determine the effective column accounted for a tab character
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 3  # Adjust 1 for space character
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction maintains proper tabulation handling and improves the tracking of column positioning for tab characters, spaces, and new lines.

After applying this fix, re-run the failing test cases to ensure that the corrected function aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported in GitHub.
