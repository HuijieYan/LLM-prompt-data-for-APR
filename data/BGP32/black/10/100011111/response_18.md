### Analysis:
The issue stems from the `_partially_consume_prefix` function provided. As per the failing test, the formatting of comments after a dedent is getting affected when using tabs. The function is incorrectly handling this scenario, leading to an indentation mismatch in comments.

### Bug Explanation:
The function fails to correctly manage comments after an indent change, specifically when tabs are used. The function does not account for maintaining comment indentation post-indent/dedent operations, resulting in incorrect formatting of comments. This discrepancy causes the failing test as observed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. When encountering comments, ensure the comments are appropriately indented based on the column value.
2. Handle tab indentation properly to align comments correctly within the code.
3. Update the logic to correctly manage comment indentation in relation to code indentation.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Check for comment position in relation to column
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now ensures that comment indentation is maintained correctly, especially when dealing with tabulated code. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and pass the failing test scenarios.
