### Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments. The issue arises when there is a comment following an indented block, and its indentation level is not aligning properly with the subsequent code. This leads to failing tests due to mismatches in the expected and actual output.

#### Problematic Section:
The bug occurs when the loop encounters a newline character while `wait_for_nl` is True, indicating that indentation is finished. The current implementation assumes resetting the `current_column` to 0 for an unexpected empty line, which is incorrect.

#### Cause of the Bug:
- The function fails to adjust the `current_column` correctly after an empty line. This results in misaligned comment indentation, as seen in the failing test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to update the logic to handle the correct indentation levels after encountering a newline character while `wait_for_nl` is True. Instead of immediately resetting `current_column` to 0, adjust it based on the current indentation level.

### Code Correction:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # Adjust current_column based on indentation after encountering newline
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By revising the logic to adjust `current_column` correctly after encountering a newline, the function should now handle comment indentation properly and align with the expected outputs provided in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
