### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for a new line. When encountering a tab or space character, the function increments the `current_column` value accordingly. However, when encountering a newline character, the `current_column` is reset to 0, leading to incorrect column counts. This inaccuracy causes the function to misinterpret the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this issue, we need to update the logic for tracking the current column while considering tab characters and maintaining the correct indentation level. By adjusting the handling of newline characters and how the column count is managed, we can address the misalignment in the output text.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correction for handling tab characters, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and maintain the expected indentation levels in the output.
