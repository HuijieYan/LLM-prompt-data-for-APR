### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling the case where a comment line starts with a space or tab following an indentation. The function incorrectly handles the indentation of the comment line, leading to a misalignment of the comment in the output. The issue is specifically triggered when processing tab-indented content.

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the part of the code that handles characters in the prefix string to determine indentation levels. The incorrect identification of tab characters and spaces results in flawed indentation logic for comment lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle tab characters and spaces for indentation.
2. Ensure that the comment lines are properly aligned based on the existing code structure.
3. Adjust the handling of characters to maintain correct indentation levels for comments within the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now handle the indentation of comment lines correctly, addressing the misalignment issue reported on GitHub.
