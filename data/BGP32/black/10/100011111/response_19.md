### Bug Explanation:
The issue lies in the condition where the code incorrectly resets `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, regardless of whether the line is non-empty or not. This behavior results in incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent, leading to the failing test case. In the failing test case, the commented line is incorrectly indented after a dedent, which is not the expected behavior.

### Solution Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating `current_column` when encountering a newline character. The column count should reset only if the line is non-empty, ensuring correct alignment of comments after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Adjust the condition to check for non-empty lines
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the column count only for non-empty lines
            if current_line.strip():
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Update wait_for_nl here
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the reset of `current_column` only for non-empty lines, the corrected function should now handle comment indentation after a dedent correctly. Update the function with the corrected version to resolve the issue.
