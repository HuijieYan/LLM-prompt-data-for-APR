### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to process a given prefix according to column specifications. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation and comments, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue description. The function incorrectly adjusts the indentation of comments after a dedent operation, leading to failed test cases.

In the failing test, we observe discrepancies in the expected and actual output related to comment indentation. The function fails to maintain the correct relative indentation of the comment lines after a dedent operation.

The bug arises due to miscalculations in tracking the current indentation level, as well as improper handling of comments. The `wait_for_nl` flag is utilized to identify when to reset the column count, but it does not account for comments correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjustments should be made to accurately track the column position after dedent operations and handle comment lines appropriately. The function needs to ensure that comment indentation aligns with the surrounding code structure.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Updated Analysis:
The corrected version of the function addresses the indentation issues by resetting the column count correctly when encountering newline characters. Additionally, comments are handled within the context of indentation, ensuring that their alignment is preserved relative to the code structure. This update should resolve the failing test case and align with the expectations outlined in the provided cases and GitHub issue.
