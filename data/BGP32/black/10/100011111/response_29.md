### Bug Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process the prefix text and extract lines based on the specified column. The bug seems to arise when handling comments that need to retain the same indentation level after a dedent.

1. The function currently stores the indentation level for spaces but doesn't handle tabs correctly, leading to incorrect handling of comments after a dedent.
2. The problem occurs when the wait_for_nl flag is set after encountering an indent with a tab ('\t'). When a newline character is reached, the function fails to correctly update the current_column for tabs, causing issues with identifying the comment's correct indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabs to maintain the appropriate indentation level for comments. Specifically, the function should accurately track and update the current_column when encountering tab characters to match the intended behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust to match tab character count
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tabs to increase the current_column by 4 instead of 1, we align with the standard tab spacing convention. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to correctly process and maintain the appropriate comment indentation level after a dedent.
