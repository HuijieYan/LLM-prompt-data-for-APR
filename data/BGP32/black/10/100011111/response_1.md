### Bug Explanation:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function fails to handle the case where the comment is on a line by itself. When processing the comment line, the function mistakenly increments `current_column`, which leads to incorrect indentation. This incorrect behavior results in failing tests, as shown in the provided runtime values and expected values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic related to handling comment lines within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, ensure that the `current_column` count does not include indentation tracking for comment lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines).rstrip()
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle comment lines correctly, maintaining the expected indentation levels as per the input. This correction addresses the bug and should resolve the failing tests.
