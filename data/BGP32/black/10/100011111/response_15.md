### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle the indentation level and partially consume a prefix based on the column argument.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition for handling comments.
3. The issue arises when the function encounters a comment line after dedent, and it does not adjust the column properly, which results in incorrect handling of comments during indentation.
4. A potential strategy to fix the bug is to modify the logic for handling comments, ensuring the correct column alignment after dedent.
5. Considering the cases and expected values, the main fix should involve adjusting the indentation control for comments.

### Correction:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':  # Adjust for comments after dedent
                current_line += prefix[prefix.index('\n', prefix.find(char)):]
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the adjustment for comments after a dedent, the revised function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments, addressing the bug identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
