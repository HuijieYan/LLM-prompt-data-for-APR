### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly handle the scenario where comments are preceded by spaces or tabs, resulting in inaccurate column tracking and indentation. This leads to incorrect processing of the prefix, resulting in indentation issues on comment lines.

1. When encountering a space or tab character, the function inaccurately increments the `current_column`, causing discrepancies in keeping track of the indentation level.
2. The function does not differentiate between spaces/tabs and other characters when calculating the column position, leading to incorrect assumptions about the indentation status.
3. The logic for tracking the beginning of an indentation block (setting `wait_for_nl = True`) is not reset when encountering spaces or tabs post the indentation block, leading to prematurely finalized indent blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust how we handle space and tab characters concerning column positions and enhance the logic for tracking the start and end of an indentation block accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line + '\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic around space and tab handling and adjusting the handling of newline characters, the corrected function should now accurately track the indentation levels and process comment lines correctly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation of comments in scenarios involving tabs.
