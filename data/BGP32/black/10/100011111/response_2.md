### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling tab characters `\t`. The issue arises because the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of interpreting `\t` as equivalent to a single character for indentation purposes when calculating the column position.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the logic for handling `\t` characters so that `current_column` increments by 1 instead of 4 when encountering a tab character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment above, the function now correctly handles tab characters during indentation calculations, resolving the bug identified in the failing tests.
