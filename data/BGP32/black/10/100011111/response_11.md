### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column. The bug seems to arise when handling indentation for comments after a dedent. The issue is illustrated by the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, which indicates incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent.

The function iterates through each character in the prefix, updating the current line and column information according to spaces, tabs, and newlines encountered. When encountering a situation requiring waiting for a newline for proper indentation, the function checks if the current column is less than the specified column before returning the consumed prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, resulting in inconsistent formatting of comments compared to the following code lines. Specifically, when a comment follows a dedent, the function incorrectly maintains the previous level of indentation instead of aligning it with the current code structure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a comment after a dedent, the function aligns the comment's indentation with the current level of code indentation. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic in the function to correctly handle comments' indentation after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes a modification to ensure that when encountering a newline after a dedent, it correctly handles the alignment of comments with the code structure. It addresses the indentation issue observed in the failing test related to comments after a dedent.
