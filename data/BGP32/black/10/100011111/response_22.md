### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the leading whitespace from a prefix string until a specified column value is reached. However, the function fails to properly handle cases where the indentation stops due to a comment or an empty line after a dedent.

In Case 1, when encountering a newline character after reading `# comment`, the function incorrectly does not consider the comment's existing indentation. This leads to discrepancies between the actual and expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly maintains the existing indentation level when encountering a comment or an empty line after a dedent. This involves adjusting the logic concerning when to wait for a newline in relation to comment characters.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected logic now ensures that when encountering a comment or an empty line after a dedent, the existing indentation level is correctly preserved. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test cases.
