### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on the given column. However, there are several issues within the function that prevent it from correctly handling indentation and newline characters.

### Identified Errors:
1. The logic for handling tab characters ("\t") and space characters (" ") to calculate the current column is incorrect.
2. The condition to check for an unexpected empty line is placing the current column to 0 directly, which is not desirable.
3. The function does not correctly handle the case when the prefix is fully consumed.
4. The logic for updating the current column and waiting for a newline is not functioning as expected.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of tab characters and space characters in calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation when dealing with comments after dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. Additionally, the handling of newline characters and updating the current column based on them is flawed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the calculations for tab characters ("\t") and space characters (" ") to accurately update the current column.
2. Modify the logic to handle newline characters more appropriately, avoiding unexpected behavior.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the prefix is fully consumed and returns the correct values.
4. Correct the logic for updating the current column and waiting for a newline to properly handle indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
            current_column += spaces
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

### Justification of Corrections:
1. Updated the logic for tab characters ("\t") to calculate the number of spaces needed to align the current column correctly.
2. Adjusted the handling of space characters (" ") to increment the current column and update the current line accordingly.
3. Fixed the logic for newline characters to handle cases where the prefix is fully consumed correctly.
4. Improved the logic for updating the current column and handling newline characters to maintain indentation properly.
