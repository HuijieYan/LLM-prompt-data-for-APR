### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value while preserving the indentation of the lines within the prefix. However, there seem to be issues with how the function handles tabs and maintains the correct indentation.

### Bug Description:
The bug occurs due to how the function handles tabs. It increments `current_column` by `4` when encountering a tab (`\t`) character. This causes incorrect column counting and, in some cases, leads to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the tab handling to correctly increment the `current_column` based on the indentation level.
2. Ensure that the function maintains proper tracking of the current indentation level.
3. Update the conditions for handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters based on the expected behavior.
4. Ensure that the function correctly processes and preserves the original indentation of the lines in the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the function adjusts how tab characters are handled to correctly calculate the column position considering the indentation level. It also refines the conditions for tracking columns, spaces, tabs, and newline characters to ensure accurate processing of the prefix string while preserving the original line indentation.

By applying these modifications, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column value and maintain the proper indentation levels as expected in the provided test cases and in resolving the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes after a dedent.
