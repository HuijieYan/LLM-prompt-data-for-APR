The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues in handling the indentation levels correctly, especially when encountering tabs. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. However, the current implementation fails to handle tabs properly, resulting in incorrect behavior.

The bug stems from how the function counts the column value. Each tab character ('\t') should increment the column by 4 spaces, but the current implementation only adds 1 to the column, leading to misalignment issues. This bug causes the function to misidentify when to wait for a new line, leading to incorrect line breaks and output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that tabs are properly handled when calculating the current column value. We should adjust the column incrementation for tabs to align with the tab size, which is commonly considered as 4 spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_spacing = 4 - current_column % 4
            current_column += tab_spacing
            current_line += ' ' * tab_spacing
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version takes into account the correct indentation handling for tab characters, ensuring that the column increments correctly based on the tab size. The function should now operate as expected based on the given input/output expectations and resolve the reported issue in the GitHub bug report.
