### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on the indentation level following the provided column value. However, the function fails to correctly handle different scenarios involving spaces, tabs, and newline characters in the prefix. The function incorrectly consumes characters and updates the column value, leading to inaccurate splitting of the prefix.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In case 1, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is not properly handling the situation where the comment is at the column value, causing incorrect splitting.
2. In case 3, the function does not handle tab characters properly, resulting in an incorrect final split of the prefix.
3. In case 5, the function mistakenly stops parsing the prefix after encountering a tab, leading to an incomplete split.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the identified bugs, we need to enhance the handling of different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newline) in the prefix. We should ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column position, correctly identifies newlines, and handles tabs consistently.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust based on tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now accurately handle different scenarios involving spaces, tabs, and newlines in the prefix, ensuring correct prefix splitting based on the provided column value.
