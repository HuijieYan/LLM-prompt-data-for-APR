### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given `prefix` string character by character until a certain condition is met. However, there is a logical issue in the handling of indentations and newlines which results in incorrect behavior.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation with different characters like space, tabs, and newline.
2. Inconsistent updates of `wait_for_nl` flag, resulting in improper processing of newlines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly consume prefix characters based on indentation and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to preserve original code formatting. This issue is particularly relevant in cases where tab characters are involved.

### Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to ensure consistent handling of indentation characters (space, tab) and newlines. Additionally, the logic for processing newlines and indentation levels needs to be refined to match the expected behavior based on the provided test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the test cases and addresses the bug related to incorrect consumption of prefix characters based on different indentation levels and newlines.
