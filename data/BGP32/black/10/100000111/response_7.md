The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling tab characters and spaces during the indentation process. This bug causes issues with preserving the correct indentation level for comments after dedenting. Specifically, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable for tab characters, leading to incorrect logic for maintaining the correct column position.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how tab characters are handled in terms of column position tracking. Instead of simply incrementing the column position by a fixed value for tab characters, we should calculate the equivalent number of spaces a tab character represents and adjust the `current_column` accordingly.

Here, I provide a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate equivalent number of spaces for a tab
            spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_add
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` value based on the number of spaces a tab represents, ensuring that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments after dedenting.
