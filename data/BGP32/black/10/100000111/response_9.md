The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit considering various whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines. 

Upon analyzing the function, potential error locations involve: 
1. The condition where `wait_for_nl` is checked while processing a newline character. 
2. The comparison of the current column to the given column limit.

The bug arises due to incorrect handling of the newline character and the indentation level. When encountering a newline character, the function is supposed to reset the current column. However, it fails to consider the case where the indent level should be preserved after a newline within the prefix.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current column resets to the correct value after encountering a newline based on the given column limit. We should also handle the case where the comment should preserve its indent level after a newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indent preservation correctly after encountering a newline character within the prefix string, satisfying all the expected variable values provided in each test case.
