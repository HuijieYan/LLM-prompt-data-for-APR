Based on the analysis and expected input/output values, the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the cases where the indentation level changes due to tab characters and empty lines. The function is not updating the `current_column` correctly in these scenarios, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to consider the cases where tab characters are encountered and update the `current_column` accordingly. Additionally, handling empty lines by resetting the `current_column` to 0 is necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function now properly handles tab characters for updating `current_column` and resets `current_column` to 0 for empty lines, ensuring correct behavior in various indentation scenarios.
