### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column while handling tabulations and new lines correctly. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of tabulations and the current column count within the function.

### Error Location
The potential errors in the function are:
1. Incorrect calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tabulations.
2. Improper handling of the `current_line` content after encountering a tabulation or new line.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect updating of the `current_column` when encountering tabulations. This results in inconsistencies in the alignment of comments after dedents when tabs are present in the input.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tabulations are handled correctly when calculating the `current_column`. Additionally, we should adjust the logic related to `current_line` content creation to maintain proper indentation alignment.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column for tabs
            tab_width = 4  # Assuming tab width is 4 spaces
            tab_remaining = tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            current_column += tab_remaining
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t' or char == ' ':
            # Reset current_column after encountering tab or space
            current_column = 0 
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column after encountering a new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle the tabulations and maintain correct indentation alignment for comments after dedents, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
