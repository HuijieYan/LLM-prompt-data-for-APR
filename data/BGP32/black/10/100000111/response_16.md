The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string while keeping track of indentation levels. The bug seems to be related to incorrect tracking of the indentation level, causing unexpected behavior when encountering certain characters like newline or tabs.

One potential issue is that when a character is not a space, tab, or newline, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` but does not reset the `current_column` to zero. This can lead to incorrect indentation levels being recorded.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that whenever a non-space, non-tab, non-newline character is encountered, the `current_column` should be set to zero to indicate the end of the indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is reset to zero whenever a non-space, non-tab, non-newline character is encountered, preventing incorrect tracking of indentation levels.
