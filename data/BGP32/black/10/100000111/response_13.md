This bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation and new lines within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specific column and return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function incorrectly handles the case when a tab character is encountered in the input prefix string. It should account for the correct indentation level based on tabs.
2. The function also fails to handle the scenario where there is a mix of indentation using spaces and tabs, leading to incorrect column calculations.
3. The flag `wait_for_nl` is not appropriately managed, leading to premature line concatenation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for calculating the `current_column` when encountering tabs to account for tab width (typically considered as 4 spaces).
2. Adjust the condition for handling indentation characters to correctly identify the end of indentation.
3. Properly manage the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure correct line concatenation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using the corrected function above, the issues related to incorrect tab handling and premature line concatenation should be resolved, thus addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
