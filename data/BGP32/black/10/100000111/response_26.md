### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column while handling indentation, tabs, and new lines. It seems to have issues correctly handling tab characters and newline characters as well as resetting the current line and current column values.

### Bugs
1. The function fails to correctly handle tab characters while calculating the current column position.
2. The logic for resetting the `current_column` when encountering a newline character is incorrect.
3. Handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag is causing incorrect line breaks and incorrect consumption of tabs.
4. The function does not properly construct the final consumed lines after indentation handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for handling tab characters to increment the `current_column` by 1 when a tab is encountered.
2. Reset the `current_column` to 0 when a newline character is encountered.
3. Adjust the logic related to `wait_for_nl` to accurately control line breaks.
4. Ensure that the correct lines are constructed and returned at the end of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Adjusted for tab handling
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True  # Adjusted logic
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
``` 

With the above corrections, the function should now correctly handle tab characters, newline characters, and line breaks while consuming the prefix string up to a specified column.
