### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have an issue with handling tab characters within the prefix input. Specifically, the function incorrectly counts tabs as one character instead of the expected behavior of a tab incrementing the column by 4. This leads to incorrect indentation calculations which cause the bug reported on GitHub. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters so that each tab increases the `current_column` variable by 4. This change should align the function's behavior with the expected indentation calculations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version includes the adjustment to increment `current_column` by 4 for every tab character encountered. This modification ensures that tabs are correctly handled in the calculation of column positions.
