### Analyzing the buggy function
The _partially_consume_prefix function is meant to process a given prefix sequence character by character until a specified column is reached, handling indentation and newlines appropriately. However, there seem to be issues with how the function manages the columns and lines, especially when dealing with tab characters.

### Identified potential errors
1. Incorrect handling of indentation for tab characters.
2. Inconsistent column calculation when encountering different kinds of characters.
3. Inappropriate updates to variables like current_column and current_line.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of tab characters in the function. The current implementation does not properly account for tab characters when calculating the current column position. This leads to misalignment and improper handling of indentation levels, especially in cases where tabs are involved.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way tab characters are processed and factor in their contribution to the column position. The function should accurately calculate the column position for both spaces and tab characters to maintain proper alignment.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function appropriately handles tab characters, correctly calculates column positions for both spaces and tabs, and ensures proper alignment and indentation processing.
