## Analysis and Bug Fixing

### Issue Summary
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string character by character and build lines based on specific conditions related to whitespaces and newline characters. However, the current implementation does not handle the indentation correctly when encountering tab characters ('\t'). This leads to incorrect processing, especially in cases where tab characters are involved.

### Bug Location
The bug primarily stems from how tab characters are handled in the loop. The condition for tab characters (`elif char == '\t'`) increments `current_column` by a fixed amount (4 spaces) instead of considering the actual tab size. This inaccurate increment results in incorrect indentation processing.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 3 and Case 5, where tab characters are present in the input prefix, the incorrect handling of tab characters leads to discrepancies in the `current_column` value, causing the lines to be incorrectly formed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and accurately handle tab characters, the function should update the increment of `current_column` for tab characters based on the actual tab size. This adjustment will ensure correct indentation and line formation during prefix processing.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    tab_size = 4  # Define the tab size
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size  # Adjust for tab size
            
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now, with the corrected function handling tab characters appropriately based on the tab size, the processing of indentation and prefixes should align correctly with the expected input/output values.
