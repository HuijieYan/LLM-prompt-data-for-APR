### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix for indentation purposes. However, the function has a bug that causes incorrect behavior when handling tab characters within the prefix. This bug can lead to incorrect indentation levels, causing issues like the one reported on GitHub.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incrementing `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character may lead to incorrect handling of tabs.
2. Incorrect logic for checking when to wait for a new line character.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tab characters in the prefix. The function increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which does not align with the actual behavior of tabs when determining indentation levels. This leads to incorrect indentation levels at certain points within the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the handling of tab characters (`\t`) within the prefix needs to be modified to account for the correct indentation behavior. Adjusting the logic related to tabs and ensuring alignment with the expected behavior of tabs will help resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the current position taking tabs into account
            next_tab_stop = ((current_column + 8) // 8) * 8
            spaces_to_add = next_tab_stop - current_column
            current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add
            current_column = next_tab_stop
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the handling of tab characters by calculating the next tab stop based on the current column position. This helps ensure correct indentation levels are maintained while consuming the prefix.
