### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of the input `prefix` up to a certain column position. However, there are issues with handling newlines and different types of whitespace characters leading to incorrect indentation.

### Identified Errors:
1. The condition to check if the char is a newline and then reset the `current_column` is not functioning correctly.
2. Indentation levels are not properly handled when encountering whitespace characters.
3. The logic for updating the `current_column` is inconsistent.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of newline characters and varying whitespace types causing unexpected changes in the `current_column` value based on the encountered characters. This leads to incorrect indentation levels during prefix consumption.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that newline characters reset the `current_column` to 0 consistently.
2. Update the logic for counting whitespace characters to maintain a correct `current_column`.
3. Adjust the `wait_for_nl` condition to behave appropriately when encountering different characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments above, the corrected function should now handle the prefix consumption and maintain the correct indentation levels as expected in the provided test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes.
