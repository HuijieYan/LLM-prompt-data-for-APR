### Problem Analysis:
- The method `_partially_consume_prefix()` is designed to consume characters from the input `prefix` until a certain column limit is reached.
- However, there are issues with handling various characters like spaces, tabs, and newline characters that lead to incorrect results based on the expected output values stated.
- The function fails to correctly track the column index and handle different types of characters leading to incorrect line formations.

### Bug Cause:
1. Inaccurate handling of column count based on different character types.
2. Incorrect handling of newline characters and their effect on column count.
3. Lack of correct logic for updating indexes and lines based on character types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the column count accurately for different character types to maintain the correct index.
2. Properly handle newline characters and adjust indexes accordingly.
3. Implement a logic to update lines and indexes based on character types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now correctly process the input `prefix` based on the specified column limit and handle different types of characters in a consistent manner.
