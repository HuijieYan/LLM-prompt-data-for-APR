The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue where it fails to properly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent operation. This issue is closely related to the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

The buggy function encounters a problem when handling the column position during the interpretation of tabs (`\t`) for indentation. The conditional checks for handling tab characters do not accurately calculate the new column position, resulting in incorrect indentation adjustments for comments.

To fix this bug, a possible strategy is to update the handling of tab characters (`\t`) within the function to correctly adjust the `current_column` value based on the tab's actual spacing. By properly considering tabs as equivalent to 4 spaces, the function should be able to maintain correct indentation throughout the process.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab characters to be equivalent to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that tab characters are properly handled as equivalent to 4 spaces when calculating the `current_column` position, thereby maintaining the correct indentation structure as expected.
