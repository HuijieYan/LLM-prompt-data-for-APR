### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string character by character, considering whitespace characters like space, tabs, and newline. The function accumulates characters until it reaches a newline, at which point it updates the current line and column count. The main issue seems to be with handling the tab characters while calculating the column offset.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of tab characters, as each tab character should increment the `current_column` by 4, but in certain cases, it is only incrementing by 1. This discrepancy leads to incorrect column counts and affects the overall line processing.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are handled correctly to update the `current_column` by 4 each time a tab character is encountered. This adjustment will align the column counts with the expected values and ensure proper processing of the input prefix.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust column count for tab character
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

Now, the corrected function properly handles tab characters by incrementing the `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character. This adjustment ensures that the column counts are consistent and align with the expected values provided for each test case.
