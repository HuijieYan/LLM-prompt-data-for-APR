### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value and return the consumed portion and the remaining part. The issue described relates to incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Bugs:
1. The code does not properly handle tab characters (`'\t'`) when calculating the current column.
2. The logic for handling empty lines is not consistent with the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the calculation of `current_column` to properly handle tab characters.
2. Update the logic for empty lines to ensure correct column tracking.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Handle tabs properly
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function addresses the tab character handling and the logic for empty lines, aligning with the expected variable values and types for the given test cases.
