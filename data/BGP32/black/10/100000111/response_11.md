After analyzing the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it's evident that the issue lies in the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tab characters. The current implementation increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which is inconsistent with the behavior of tab characters in Python source code.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tab characters to align with Python's behavior. Tab characters should advance the column to the next multiple of 8, not a fixed increment of 4.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8  # Advance to the next multiple of 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that tab characters are handled correctly in determining the column position, aligning with Python's standard practice. This update should address the indentation issue described in the GitHub issue as well.
