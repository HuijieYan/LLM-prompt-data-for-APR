### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where it checks if `wait_for_nl` is `True`, but the logic to handle this condition is incorrect. When `wait_for_nl` is `True`, it should be waiting for a new line character to check if the current line's column is less than the specified `column` value. However, when the condition `char == '\n'` is met, it resets the `current_column` to 0 without checking the indentation level first. This leads to incorrect behavior when the function tries to consume the prefix up to a certain column.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `if wait_for_nl` block. We should first check if the current line's indentation (represented by `current_column`) is less than the specified `column` value, and only then proceed to append the current line to `lines`. Additionally, after encountering a new line character, the `current_column` should be reset to 0.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these modifications to the logic inside the `if wait_for_nl` block, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column and pass the failing test cases.
