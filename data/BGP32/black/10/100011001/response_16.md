### Bug Explanation:

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value while handling whitespace characters. However, the bug lies within the condition for handling newline characters (`\n`). When a newline character is encountered, the function resets the `current_column` to 0 but fails to handle cases where the current line is not empty. This results in an incorrect indentation comparison when returning the consumed lines.

### Bug Location:

The bug is located in the `elif char == '\n':` block where the current column is reset to 0 without considering whether it should consume the whitespaces before the newline character.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, we evaluate whether the current line is non-empty and whether the current column is less than the target column. If these conditions are met, we should consume the complete line, including the newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Include the current column as well
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line in the consumed result
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the function should now handle the indentation appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
