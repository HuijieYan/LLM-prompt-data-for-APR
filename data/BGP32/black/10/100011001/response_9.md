### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the indentation and line breaks while consuming characters from the `prefix`. The function is supposed to consume characters until it reaches a specific column, but it fails to handle indentation correctly when encountering spaces, tabs, and newlines. This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix string.

### Bug Location:
The bug is primarily located in the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines within the loop that iterates over the characters in the `prefix`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function prematurely ending the current line and not correctly incrementing the `current_column` when encountering spaces and tabs. This leads to incorrect line splitting and column tracking.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles spaces, tabs, and newlines when calculating the current column and splitting the prefix string into lines. Specifically, we need to ensure that spaces and tabs increment the `current_column` correctly and that newlines reset the column count.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now correctly handles spaces, tabs, and newlines to ensure proper line splitting and column tracking while consuming characters from the `prefix`. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected based on the failing test case.
