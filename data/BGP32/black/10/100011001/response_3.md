### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is incorrect. This condition is checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column. However, this condition is problematic because it doesn't consider the whitespace characters like spaces or tabs in the line. 

For example, in Case 1, the current line `'    # comment\n'` has 4 leading spaces followed by the comment. But the condition `current_column < column` is comparing the `current_column`, which is 4, with the specified `column` of 8, leading to an incorrect check. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly handle the comparison based on the count of actual characters excluding the whitespace characters. We also need to consider tabs as they are considered equivalent to 4 spaces.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                actual_columns = sum(4 if c == '\t' else 1 for c in current_line.strip())
                if actual_columns < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += '    ' # Convert tab to 4 spaces for accurate column count
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version properly calculates the actual column count by considering both spaces and tabs and compares it against the specified `column` value.
