### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to incorrectly handling the indentation during the processing of the `prefix`. The function is designed to partially consume prefix text up to a certain column number. The issue occurs when it encounters a comment line in the prefix text. The function does not handle comments correctly, leading to the incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly identifies `'# comment\n'` as a part of the prefix that needs to be consumed before reaching the column limit. However, comments should not affect the column count.
2. In Case 3, the function adds the comment line to `lines` directly, which is incorrect since comments should not be part of the consumed text.
3. In Case 5, the function processes the comment line as if it was part of the indentation, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that comments are appropriately handled and not counted towards the column limit. We should modify the logic related to handling comments within the prefix text.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip():  # check if current line is not just whitespace
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a condition to only add non-whitespace lines to `lines` when encountering a newline character, we can avoid incorrectly counting comment lines towards the consumed text. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
