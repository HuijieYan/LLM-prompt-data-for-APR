### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the provided `column`. The function tries to identify the correct portion of the prefix string that should be consumed based on the indentation rules.

From the error message and the failing test case values, it is evident that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments. The specific issue seems to be related to the logic inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block when encountering a newline character `'\n'`.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test, the input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '`, and the expected output should be `'    # comment\n'`. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling this case when encountering the newline character.
- When the function encounters a newline character `'\n'` and `wait_for_nl` is True, it should check whether the indentation meets the required criteria before adding the current line to the lines list. In this case, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is not correctly capturing the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the condition inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the indentation scenario for comments.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:  # include lines with equal indentation
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making this correction, the function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly. This should address the issue seen in the failing test and produce the expected output.
