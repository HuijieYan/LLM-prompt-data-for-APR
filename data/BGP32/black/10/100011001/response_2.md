### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of indentation levels in the provided prefix string. The function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. In cases where the prefix contains comments, the function does not account for correct indentation levels and does not properly handle the comment lines.

The issue arises when the function encounters a comment line within the prefix. It doesn't correctly identify the start of the comment line and fails to adjust the current indentation level accordingly. As a result, when the comment line is encountered, it might not be correctly included in the consumed prefix up to the specified column. This behavior causes the function to return an incorrect result compared to the expected output, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles comment lines and adjusts the current indentation level accordingly. Specifically, when a comment line is encountered, the function should account for the indentation of the comment line and adjust the consumed prefix accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle comment lines and adjust the consumed prefix up to the specified column, ensuring that the test cases pass successfully.
