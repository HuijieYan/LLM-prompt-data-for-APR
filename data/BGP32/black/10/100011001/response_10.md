### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when a comment line starts with whitespace characters, it incorrectly increments the `current_column` value and does not handle the case when the comment line starts at or beyond the specified `column`. This leads to incorrect indentation handling, causing the function to fail when comparing the expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to properly handle the scenario where a comment line starts at the specified `column` or beyond. Additionally, the whitespace characters at the beginning of a line should not increment the `current_column` value. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments in the corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle the defined scenarios and pass the failing test.
