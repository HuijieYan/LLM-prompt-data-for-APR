### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic used to handle newline characters when calculating the current column for prefix consumption. The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 for every newline character encountered, disregarding the tabs or spaces that should contribute to the column count. This results in incorrect behavior when consuming prefixes with mixed tabs and spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated when encountering newline characters, taking into account any preceding tabs or spaces. We should update the logic to handle tab (`\t`) and space (`' '`) characters as intended, incrementing the `current_column` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version properly handles the tab and space characters to increment the `current_column` accurately, ensuring correct prefix consumption and column calculation.
