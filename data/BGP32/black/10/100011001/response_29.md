### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when handling the indentation of comments in the prefix. The function incorrectly assumes that the comment line should not be part of the indentation count and breaks the line before it. This behavior results in the mismatch between the expected and actual outputs in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling comments as part of the indentation count correctly. Specifically, comments should be considered as part of the indentation when calculating the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for new line
            if current_line.strip() == '#':  # Check if line is only a comment
                current_line += prefix[prefix.index('\n', len(current_line)):]
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including a check for comments in the logic, this corrected version should handle the indentation of comments properly, ultimately passing the failing test cases.
