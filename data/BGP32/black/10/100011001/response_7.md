### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines. The function tries to consume parts of a prefix string up to a specific column index and return the consumed part along with the remainder. However, the logic for handling indentation levels and newlines is flawed, leading to incorrect slicing of the prefix string.

### Bug Location
The bug primarily lies in the conditional statements that check for spaces, tabs, and newlines. The logic related to `wait_for_nl` is causing issues, as it doesn't correctly reset the necessary variables to handle indentation levels and newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately consumes the prefix up to the specified column while considering the indentation levels. The conditions for tracking indentation levels and newlines need to be adjusted to properly handle cases where the prefix contains multiple lines with different indentation levels.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic in the `else` block and maintaining proper tracking of the current indentation level and handling of newlines, the corrected version of the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.
