### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering a comment. The function does not consider updating the `current_column` appropriately when encountering a comment line. This results in incorrect comparisons with the provided `column` value leading to incorrect returns.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `current_column` value when encountering a comment line by setting it to the length of the comment line.
2. When checking if the current line's indentation level is less than the provided `column`, use `len(current_line.expandtabs())` to account for both spaces and tabs in the indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle comments and indentation levels, passing the failing test case.
