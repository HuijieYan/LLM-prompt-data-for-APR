### Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a specific column. It tracks the current line being built, the current column, and a flag to wait for the next newline character before processing further.

The bug arises when encountering a newline character ("\n") while waiting for one. In this scenario, the function incorrectly handles the situation where the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the target column. Instead of appending the current line to the lines list, it appends it after the target newline has been found.

### Bug Location

The bug is in the condition where the function checks if it should wait for the next newline character. Here, the code should first check if the current column has reached the desired target before handling the newline character.

### Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we should adjust the conditional check for the newline character to ensure that when a newline is encountered, and there is still text on the current line, it is checked against the target column before adding it to the lines list. 

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that when a newline character is encountered, and the current line is not empty, it is checked against the target column before processing further.
