### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation of comments within the prefix string. In particular, when the function encounters a comment character ('#'), it incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to True, expecting a newline character to signal the end of the comment. This causes the function to cut off the comment prematurely.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles comments. We should not set `wait_for_nl` to True when encountering a comment character. Instead, we should continue processing the comment until encountering a newline character.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # continue processing the comment until a newline character
            while prefix[prefix.index(char):].startswith('#'):
                current_line += prefix[prefix.index(char)]
                char = prefix[prefix.index(char)]
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the commented changes to the function, it should now correctly handle comments within the prefix string without cutting them off prematurely.
