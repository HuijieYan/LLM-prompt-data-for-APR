### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` arises from not handling the case where there is a space before the newline character. This causes the indentation to be incorrect in cases where a comment is at the same level as the code instead of being indented to match the code.

In cases where the comment starts with a space or tab character before the comment itself, the function does not correctly calculate the indentation level and hence does not handle these cases properly, leading to a failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to correctly handle cases where there are initial spaces or tabs before the comment. We need to adjust the indentation calculation based on the content of `char` and the `current_column` value to maintain the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                # Adjust the indentation based on spaces or tabs before comments
                current_column -= 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle cases where comments have initial indentation spaces or tabs and return the expected output for the failing tests.
