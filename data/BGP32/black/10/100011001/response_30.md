### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is intended to handle indentation and newline characters within a given prefix string. The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output. This discrepancy is likely due to how the function handles whitespace characters, indentation, and newline characters.

Based on the runtime values provided, the bug seems to be related to how the function detects and processes newline characters (`\n`). In some cases, the function fails to correctly identify and handle the newline characters within the prefix string, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Cause:
The function does not properly handle cases where the last character in the prefix is a whitespace character (either space or tab) before the final newline character. This leads to incorrect identification of the end of the indentation or the presence of a new line. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering newline characters.

### Bug Fix:
To address the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles newline characters, particularly when the last character before a newline is whitespace. We should ensure that `wait_for_nl` is properly reset when encountering a newline character. Additionally, we need to correctly calculate the indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `wait_for_nl` appropriately and adjusting the processing logic for both whitespace characters and newline characters, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation and newline scenarios correctly and pass the failing test cases.
