### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering the '#' character for a comment in the prefix string. When a '#' character is encountered, the function should check if the current column is less than the specified column value and continue building the lines until it reaches the correct column.

The bug arises because the function is prematurely returning the current aggregation of lines when encountering a newline character '\n' before the column condition is met. This premature return leads to an incorrect splitting of the prefix string, resulting in the assertion failure in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function continues building the lines until the correct column is reached even if a newline character is encountered. We should only return the aggregated lines once the column condition is satisfied.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the lines are properly aggregated until the correct column is reached, even if newline characters are encountered. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing tests.
