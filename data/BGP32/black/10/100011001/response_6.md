### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number while keeping track of indentation with spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles newlines in the input prefix string.

The issue arises when the code encounters a newline character in the prefix string. The current logic resets the `current_column` to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered, which results in the indentation level being discarded. This behavior is incorrect as it should only reset the `current_column` if it is necessary based on the given `column`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles newline characters. Instead of always resetting the `current_column` to 0, we should only do so if the current column is greater than the target `column` value. This adjustment will ensure that the function maintains correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines) + current_line, prefix[len(''.join(lines) + current_line):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly maintains indentation levels when encountering newline characters in the prefix string.
