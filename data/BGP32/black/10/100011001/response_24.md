### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises because the condition for checking column indentation is not correctly implemented. The function is supposed to consume characters from the given prefix until the column indentation is properly aligned. However, the bug causes it to misinterpret the indentation level, leading to incorrect results when comparing the prefix content against the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation levels within the prefix string. Specifically, we should ensure that the function correctly calculates and compares the column indentation before deciding to consume or stop consuming characters. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections above, re-run the failing test to verify that the function now behaves as expected and passes the test cases.
