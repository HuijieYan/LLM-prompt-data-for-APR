### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a specific column limit is reached. However, the current implementation has a bug when encountering a comment since it incorrectly consumes characters after the comment symbol (`#`). This leads to incorrect consumed prefixes and results in failing tests.

In the failing test scenario, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of the comment line, resulting in an inconsistency in the generated `actual` value compared to the `expected` value. This issue stems from not properly considering comment lines.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line (# comment) in the prefix. Instead of stopping at the end of the comment line, the function continues to consume characters after the comment symbol ('#'). This causes the function to incorrectly calculate the consumed prefix and leads to failing tests.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the function to correctly handle comment lines. When a comment line is encountered, we should stop the consumption at the end of the comment line while preserving the comment itself.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                if not current_line.strip():  # Handle empty lines
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):  # Handle comments
                if current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version now correctly handles comment lines when consuming the prefix, ensuring that comments are correctly recognized and the prefix is consumed up to the specified column limit.
