### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the lines are appended and checked for the column limit. The issue arises when the last `if` statement inside the loop is triggered, causing the current line to be added to `lines` before checking if it exceeds the column limit.

### Bug Location:
The bug is specifically located in the condition where the code appends the current line to `lines` without checking if it exceeds the column limit.

### Bug Cause:
When `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` and a newline character is encountered, the current line gets appended to `lines` and then reset. This step occurs before checking if the line's length exceeds the specified column limit. Subsequently, the check for the column limit is ignored for the processed line. This behavior causes the function to incorrectly output lines that exceed the column limit in certain cases.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the check for the column limit should precede the appending of the current line to `lines`. This adjustment ensures that lines are only added to the output if they comply with the column limit.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly checks the column limit before appending the current line to the output, resolving the issue with lines exceeding the specified column.
