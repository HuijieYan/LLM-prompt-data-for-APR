### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition that determines when to consume the prefix. The current implementation sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` when encountering a non-space or non-tab character, indicating that the prefix indentation has ended. However, this logic is flawed as it should only wait for a newline character when a non-space, non-tab character is encountered.

Additionally, the check for the column position is incorrect. The function checks for the column position after adding the current line to the lines list, which can result in the incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` to only trigger on encountering a non-space and non-tab character.
2. Update the check for the column position to ensure it is correctly evaluated before adding the current line to the lines list.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if not wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By applying the above corrections to the function, it should now properly handle indentation and consume the prefix as intended, producing the correct output and passing the failing test cases.
