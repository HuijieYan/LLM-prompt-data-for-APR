### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it prematurely returns when encountering a newline character that is not preceded by whitespace characters. This causes the function to return only the accumulated lines before the newline character and discards the rest of the prefix, resulting in incorrect behavior when trying to consume the prefix based on a specified column.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic so that the function waits until encountering a non-whitespace character following a newline to properly consume the prefix up to the specified column. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the situation when reaching the end of the prefix without finding a newline to consume.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column for the new line after checking indentation
                if not current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
``` 

By making the adjustments as shown in the corrected function, the function now properly consumes the prefix up to the specified column, handles empty lines correctly, and ensures that all characters of the prefix are consumed when necessary.
