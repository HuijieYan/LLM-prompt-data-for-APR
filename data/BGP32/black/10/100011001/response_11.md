### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly process the indentation when encountering a comment within the given prefix string. It fails to handle the case where a comment is encountered before reaching the desired column indentation. This results in incorrect slicing of the prefix string, leading to a mismatch when comparing the expected and actual output strings.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the case where a comment is encountered before the desired column indentation correctly. This involves updating the logic related to tracking the current column position and handling comments within the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Rationale:
In the corrected version:
- If a newline character is encountered after a comment, the function resets the current column count to 0 unless the line starts with a comment. This prevents prematurely cutting off the prefix string.
- The logic for handling indentation and comments within the prefix string is appropriately adjusted to ensure correct behavior when processing comments.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle comment indentation correctly and produce the expected output, passing the failing test cases.
