### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where `wait_for_nl` is True and the current character is a '\n'. When this condition is met, it incorrectly appends the current line to the `lines` list without checking if the current line is empty. This leads to the unwanted inclusion of empty lines in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that only non-empty lines are appended to the `lines` list when `wait_for_nl` is True and a '\n' character is encountered.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():  # Only append non-empty lines
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After implementing the corrected version of the function, run the failing test case provided. If the corrected function passes the test, it indicates that the bug has been successfully fixed.
