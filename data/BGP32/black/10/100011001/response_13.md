### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When the function encounters a comment line, it incorrectly treats the '#' character as marking the start of a new line for indentation comparison. This leads to an incorrect comparison between the expected output and the actual output, resulting in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle comment lines. It should not treat '#' characters within comments as marking the start of a new line for indentation comparison. Instead, the function should continue parsing the current line normally, considering comments as part of the line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Fix: Reset wait_for_nl flag for every newline character
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By directly setting `wait_for_nl = False` when encountering a newline character and not treating comments as new lines for indentation comparison, the corrected function should now handle comment lines correctly and pass the failing test cases.
