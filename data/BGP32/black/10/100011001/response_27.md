### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the function to return incorrect results. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a given column number, splitting it into lines based on newline characters. However, the bug seems to stem from handling indentation and comment lines correctly.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, we can see that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not being correctly reset, leading to incorrect handling of comment lines. Additionally, the condition inside the `if wait_for_nl` block seems to be skipping the logic for handling comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly toggled to improve the handling of newlines and comments.
2. Update the conditions inside the `if wait_for_nl` block to correctly check for comment lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly toggled and takes into account comment lines while consuming the prefix up to the given column number.
