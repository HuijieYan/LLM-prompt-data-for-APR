### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation level within the provided `prefix` string. The function is intended to adjust the indentation level based on the given `column` value. However, the current implementation has a bug where it fails to properly handle the indentation level and the presence of newline characters. This bug causes the function to not correctly adjust the indentation, leading to the failing test case.

The main issues in the current implementation are:
1. Incorrect calculation of indentation level (`current_column`) when encountering spaces and tabs.
2. Improper handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag for determining when to wait for a newline character before processing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure proper handling of the indentation level and newline characters. Specifically, we should:
1. Update the logic for calculating the `current_column` correctly based on spaces and tabs encountered.
2. Adjust the `wait_for_nl` flag to appropriately control when to wait for a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the indentation and newline characters in the `prefix` string, addressing the logic errors present in the original implementation.
