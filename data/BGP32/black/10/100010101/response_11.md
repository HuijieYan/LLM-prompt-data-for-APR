### Analysis:
- The function is designed to partially consume a given prefix by checking indentation levels based on spaces (' '), tabs ('\t'), and newlines ('\n').
- The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line and resets the indentation level to 0 prematurely.
- This bug causes incorrect handling of remaining prefix characters and leads to a mismatch with the expected output.
- To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle empty lines and correctly reset the indentation level.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and (char != ' ' and char != '\t' and char != '\n'):
            wait_for_nl = False
        
        if wait_for_nl or char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Note:
The bug fix involves checking for unexpected characters before resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag. This ensures that lines with only whitespace characters are handled correctly. After applying this fix, the function should pass all the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
