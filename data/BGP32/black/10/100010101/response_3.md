### Analysis
- The current_line variable is not being properly updated when the wait_for_nl condition is False, resulting in missing characters.
- The current_column variable is not being updated correctly when encountering tabs or spaces, leading to incorrect indentation tracking.
- The decision to return early when encountering a new line character even if the current line does not meet the column criteria is causing inaccuracies.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to properly handle the indentation level when processing lines of text based on the given input. The incomplete updating of variables like current_line and current_column leads to incorrect behavior, specifically when dealing with tabs, spaces, and new line characters.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the current_line variable accumulates all characters processed correctly in all conditions.
2. Update the current_column accurately based on the type of character encountered.
3. Remove the premature return when encountering a new line character to correctly handle incomplete lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
