### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a part of the prefix string based on the specified column value. However, there is a bug in the logic where it fails to correctly handle the case where a comment is encountered in the prefix string.

The bug occurs when encountering a comment character `#` within the prefix string. It incorrectly processes the newline character `\n` associated with the comment, resulting in incorrect line formatting and failing the test.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle comments and newlines within the prefix string, ensuring that the indentation is preserved correctly.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic that deals with processing comments and newlines within the prefix string. Specifically, we need to ensure that when encountering a comment character `#`, the function correctly handles the indentation and the following newline character `\n`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes an additional check for encountering a newline character `\n` within the prefix string, ensuring that the correct line formatting is maintained even when comments are present. This modification will allow the function to pass the failing test case and handle comments properly.
