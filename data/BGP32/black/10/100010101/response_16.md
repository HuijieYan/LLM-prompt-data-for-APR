The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The function has a bug where it fails to correctly handle the situation when a comment line is encountered. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by the length of the comment line, leading to incorrect output.

The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results, which results in failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the current column count is incremented. Instead of incrementing it by the length of the comment line, we should only consider the visible characters (not including whitespaces like tabs or spaces) for incrementing the column count.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle comment lines and increment the column count suitably.
