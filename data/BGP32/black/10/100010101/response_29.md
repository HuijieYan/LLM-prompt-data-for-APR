### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to remove a prefix from the input string until a certain column position is reached, considering indentation with spaces and tabs. However, it fails to correctly handle the scenario where a comment starts at the correct column but continues onto the next line. This results in incorrect output and the failing test case.

### Bug
The bug arises from the condition to handle when the comment extends beyond the specified column limit. When the condition to wait for a new line is triggered, the comment can be added to the `lines` list prematurely, leading to incorrect output.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to include the final line, which contains the comment but exceeds the specified column limit, in the `lines` list before returning the result. This ensures that the entire comment is correctly captured.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res + current_line, prefix[len(res + current_line):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the comment continues correctly onto the next line when the specified column limit is reached.
