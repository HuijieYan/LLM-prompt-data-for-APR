### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a specified column. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles comments that span multiple lines.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case, the prefix contains a comment (starting with `#`) that spans multiple lines.
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) inside a comment while parsing the prefix.
3. In such cases, the function should ignore the newline character and continue building the current line until it reaches the specified column. However, the current implementation incorrectly considers the newline character as the end of the line, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic where the function consumes characters and builds lines. Specifically, when encountering a newline character within a comment, we should continue building the current line until the column is reached.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            # Handle newline inside comment continuation
            if char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if we reached the specified column
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Start of a comment, skip newline if present
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = False
        lines.append(current_line)
        current_line = ""

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle comments spanning multiple lines and return the expected output for the failing test case.
