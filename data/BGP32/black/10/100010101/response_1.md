### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of a prefix string, up to a specific column. However, the function has a bug causing it to include the entire string up to the column, instead of stopping at the correct indentation level. This behavior results in incorrect output compared to the expected values provided for different test cases.

### Bug Explanation
The main issue is in the condition `current_column < column` which incorrectly checks whether the current column position is less than the specified column instead of if it is equal to or greater than the specified column. This leads to the function consuming the entire prefix until the end instead of up to the specified column.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the condition `if current_column < column:` should be changed to `if current_column >= column:`. This will ensure that the function stops consuming the prefix when reaching the correct column indentation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
