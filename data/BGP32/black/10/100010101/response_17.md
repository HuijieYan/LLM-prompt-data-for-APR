### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column number. The function iterates over the prefix string character by character, accumulating characters from the beginning of each line until reaching the specified column. However, the function has a bug causing it to improperly split lines when there is a comment line with an inadequate indentation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line (`# comment`) that has less indentation than the specified column. In this scenario, the function incorrectly skips consuming the line thinking it's an indent, leading to an incorrect output when compared to the expected value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles comment lines, specifically ensuring that the function consumes the comment lines correctly based on the specified column. We can modify the logic to correctly identify when a comment line should be consumed or not based on its indentation level.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#') and current_line.isspace() == False:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes a modification to consider comment lines properly, ensuring that they are consumed correctly based on the specified column for indentation.
