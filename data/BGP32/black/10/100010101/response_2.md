### Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of prefix lines with whitespace characters. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column number. However, the current implementation has issues when dealing with whitespace characters like spaces and tabs, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) in the input prefix string. The function calculates the `current_column` value incorrectly when encountering different types of whitespace characters, leading to wrong decisions regarding the line break. This results in the function returning incorrect prefix substring.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function calculates the `current_column` value based on different types of whitespace characters. We need to correctly keep track of the indentation level in the prefix string to ensure proper partial consumption. Additionally, we should handle '\n' characters differently to maintain the correct line breaks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic for handling whitespace characters and line breaks, the updated function should now be able to correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column number. This correction should ensure that the function returns the expected output for the given test cases.
