### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached.
2. The function seems to have an issue with handling indentation and waiting for a new line character.
3. The error message indicates a problem with comment indentation. It suggests that the comment line should be properly aligned, but the function is not handling it correctly.
4. The function fails to properly indent comments because it waits for a new line after encountering a non-space character, which may result in incorrect behavior.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles different characters and track the changes in indentation properly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the comment indentation along with the other characters and columns as expected.
