### Analysis
- The function is designed to process a given `prefix` string based on indentation rules.
- The function tracks the current line being processed, the current column number, and whether it is waiting for a new line.
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line within the `prefix` string and fails to handle the indentation correctly.

### Error Explanation
- The failing test case comparison shows a discrepancy in the placement of the comment line in the output.
- The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comment lines in some cases, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The function needs to correctly handle comment lines and ensure that they are aligned with the appropriate indentation level.

### Updated Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = current_line.rstrip()  # remove extra spaces at the end
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    current_line = current_line.rstrip()  # remove extra spaces at the end
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After updating the function with the given changes, it should now correctly handle the indentation of comment lines and produce the expected output.
