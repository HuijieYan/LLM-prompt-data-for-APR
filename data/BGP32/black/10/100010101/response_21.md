### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix until a specific column is reached. However, the current implementation is incorrect as it does not handle cases where the prefix contains newlines or tab characters properly.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character in the prefix. The `current_column` is not being reset to 0 when a newline is encountered, leading to incorrect positioning of the current line.

### Fix
To fix this bug, we need to reset the `current_column` to 0 when a newline character is encountered in the prefix.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column to 0 when encountering a newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
