### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the given `prefix` string until reaching a specific `column` value, considering indentation. However, there are two main issues causing the bug:
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly toggled, leading to incorrect handling of new lines and indentation.
2. The logic for checking and updating the `current_column` value is flawed, causing incorrect calculations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of indentation and new lines within the `prefix` string. When encountering a space or tab character after a keyword, the function wrongly tracks the current column position. This leads to incorrect slicing of the `prefix` string and incorrect indentation in the returned result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly toggled when encountering new lines.
2. Update the logic for incrementing the `current_column` value based on space and tab characters.
3. Maintain correct tracking of the current column position to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected version ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly toggled and updates the `current_column` value based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. This should address the issues and pass the failing tests.
