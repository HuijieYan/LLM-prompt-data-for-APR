### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of whitespace characters, specifically tabs and spaces. The function is intended to consume and return a partial prefix up to a certain column limit. However, the function fails to correctly handle tabs and spaces when calculating the current column position. This results in an incorrect prefix being returned and failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both tabs and spaces are correctly interpreted when calculating the current column position. Tabs should increment the column position by 4, and spaces should increment it by 1. Additionally, we need to address the case when encountering a newline character to reset the column position and process the next line accordingly.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that tabs and spaces are correctly handled when calculating the column position, and newline characters reset the column position appropriately. With these fixes, the function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
