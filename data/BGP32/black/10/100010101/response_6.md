### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column in each line by partially considering the indentation levels. However, there are issues in the logic that lead to incorrect behavior when encountering newlines and spaces.

### Bugs:
1. The function does not handle cases where the prefix contains lines that are shorter than the specified column index.
2. The condition for resetting the current_column value is incorrect, leading to incorrect column tracking.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where the prefix contains lines shorter than the specified column index.
2. Update the logic to properly reset the current_column value when encountering newlines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and column truncation.
