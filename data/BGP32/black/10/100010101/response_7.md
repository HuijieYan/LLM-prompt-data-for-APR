### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a given prefix string partially depending on the column value.
- The function is incorrectly handling the case when encountering a newline character and not updating the line correctly.
- The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a comment starting after indentation spaces or tabs.

### Bug:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after a certain level of indentation (spaces or tabs). It fails to correctly handle the newline character and the update of the current line.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- to fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a comment, the function correctly handles the newline character and builds the lines array accordingly.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ''
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the logic to correctly handle the newline character when a comment is encountered after indentation, the bug should be fixed.
