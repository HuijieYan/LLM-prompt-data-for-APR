### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column number. However, there is a bug in the logic that prevents it from correctly capturing all the necessary lines up to the specified column. The error message indicates a mismatch in the indentation of a comment line within the prefix, which is the result of the function not handling indentation properly.

### Bug
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters within the prefix. When encountering spaces, tabs, or newlines, the function does not update the current_column value correctly, leading to an incorrect comparison with the specified column number.

### Solution Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the indentation levels and handles newline characters properly. This involves updating the current_column value based on the encountered characters and newlines to determine the correct position within the prefix.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the indentation tracking and newline handling issues, ensuring that the partial consumption of the prefix is done correctly.
