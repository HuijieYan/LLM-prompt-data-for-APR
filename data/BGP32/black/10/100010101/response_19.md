### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, it has a bug that causes it to ignore comments when calculating the current column position.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` count even when encountering a comment character `'#'`. This leads to inaccurate calculation of the current column position, which causes the function to yield incorrect results.
2. When encountering a non-space, non-tab character followed by a comment character `'#'`, the function proceeds to set `wait_for_nl` to True. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the comment character is immediately followed by a newline character `'\n'`. This leads to incorrect handling of comment lines in the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to skip characters following the `'#'` character until a newline `'\n'` character is encountered while properly calculating `current_column`.
2. Adjust the conditions to correctly handle cases where the comment character `'#'` is followed by a newline character `'\n'`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these modifications, the function should now correctly handle comment characters and newlines in the prefix string while maintaining the correct current column position. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
