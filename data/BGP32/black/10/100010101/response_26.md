### Analysis
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached or a newline character is encountered.
- The function tracks the current line being formed, the current column position, and whether it needs to wait for a newline character.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles whitespace characters and newline characters when constructing lines.

### Identified Issue
- The bug occurs when constructing lines ends prematurely without consuming the entire prefix string.
- This happens because of the conditional check `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` which may not handle all cases correctly.

### Fix Strategy
- We need to ensure that the entire prefix string is consumed correctly based on the given conditions.
- Adjust the conditions within the loop to correctly track the addition of lines and the termination conditions.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

The corrected function ensures that each line in the prefix is correctly processed and added to the `lines` list. It addresses the premature termination issue encountered in the buggy function.
