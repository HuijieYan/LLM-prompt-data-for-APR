### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a certain column value, handling indentation, tabulations, and newlines. The function maintains variables to keep track of the current line, current column, and whether a newline character is expected. 

The bug occurs when a comment line is encountered within the prefix string, causing an indentation issue. The function mistakenly consumes the comment line without considering column values correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag, which is supposed to control whether to consume characters until encountering a newline to ensure proper alignment. When encountering a comment line in the prefix string, the `wait_for_nl` flag causes the premature consumption of characters, leading to incorrect alignment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly set based on the encountered characters to accurately handle indentation. Additionally, the function should correctly handle comment lines and ensure that their alignment is preserved.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column when encountering newline
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True  # Wait for newline after comment
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version above, the function should now properly handle comment lines and maintain the correct alignment when consuming the prefix string. It should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
