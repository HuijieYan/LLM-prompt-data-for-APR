### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value.
- The function loops through each character in the prefix, updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables accordingly.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles new lines ('\n') and white spaces while not resetting `current_line` properly.

### Bug:
- When encountering a new line ('\n'), the function should reset `current_line` to an empty string and `current_column` to 0, but it fails to do so.
- This causes the `current_line` to accumulate multiple lines before a proper reset, leading to incorrect behavior in subsequent iterations.

### Fix:
- Reset `current_line` and `current_column` values properly when encountering a new line ('\n') to prevent accumulation of lines before a correct reset.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the scenario where a new line '\n' is encountered and reset `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly. This should address the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases.
