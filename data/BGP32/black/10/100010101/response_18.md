### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. It processes each character in the prefix and stops when reaching the specified column.
2. The bug in the function seems to be related to handling newline characters within the prefix string, which leads to incorrect line splitting.
3. The error message suggests that the function fails to properly handle a comment indentation scenario causing a mismatch in the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to adjust how it processes newline characters and correctly identifies the start and end of the partial prefix based on the specified column.
5. The function can be improved by ensuring that newline characters are handled properly and lines are split accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    break
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column == column:
                break
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly splits the prefix string based on the specified column and successfully handles the newline characters to generate the expected output. It should now pass the failing test cases and fulfill the expected input/output values.
