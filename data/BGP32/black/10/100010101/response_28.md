### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix until a certain column is reached, considering special cases for tab and space characters.
- The error message indicates a failure in handling comments within the prefix.
- The bug seems to be related to the condition where comments are consumed, leading to additional spaces being included in the output.
- The expected output should not contain extra spaces between the comment symbol and the actual comment text.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the buggy function, when a comment is encountered (`char == '#'`), the function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` and expects a newline character to consume the comment fully.
- If the program hits the end of the prefix without finding a newline character, the comment might not get fully consumed, resulting in extra spaces in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to consuming comments:
  - Ensure that comments are correctly consumed until a newline character is found, removing extra spaces.
  - Handle cases where the end of the prefix is reached before a newline character for the comment.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Consume full comment until newline
            wait_for_nl = True

    # Handling cases where comment reaches end of prefix
    if wait_for_nl and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the comment consuming logic, the corrected function should now handle comments correctly to avoid extra spaces in the output.
