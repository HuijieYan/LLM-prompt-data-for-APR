### Analysis
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be tasked with consuming a prefix of a given string until a certain column is reached while handling indentation properly.
2. The error is related to the indentation of comments being incorrectly managed.
3. The function does not handle the case where a comment is introduced before the expected column. This leads to incorrect behavior in handling comments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are correctly handled in terms of indentation.
5. We need to modify the logic to correctly ignore comments before the expected column value.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic to reset `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character and adding the condition to ignore comments that precede the expected column value, we ensure correct handling of comments in terms of indentation. This should now pass all the failing test cases.
