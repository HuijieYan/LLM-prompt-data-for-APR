The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the conditional check for the indentation level while processing a prefix string. The function is incorrectly handling the case where a comment is at the same indentation level as the previous line. This leads to an incorrect determination of where to split the prefix.

**Cause of the bug:**
- When the function encounters a newline character `\n`, it resets the `current_column` to 0.
- The function marks the end of the indent by setting `wait_for_nl` to `True`. But the check for indentation level is incorrect as it does not account for cases where the next line is a comment at the same indentation level.
- Due to this, it fails to correctly identify the current line's indentation level and the location to split the prefix.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**
- We need to adjust the logic of when to check for the correct indentation level and split the prefix.
- Instead of resetting `current_column` to 0 on encountering a newline character, we should only reset it if the indentation level is less than the specified column.
- We should also consider the case where there is a comment at the same indentation level as the previous line.

**Corrected Function:**
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the tab width alignment to 4 spaces
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments described above, the corrected function should now correctly handle cases where the comment is at the same indentation level as the previous line.
