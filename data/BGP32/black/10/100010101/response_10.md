### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a given prefix up to a specific column, based on indentation rules.
- The function fails to correctly handle lines that consist of only whitespace or comments.
- The error message shows a mismatch in the expected and actual output where comments are not formatted correctly.
- The function incorrectly handles the case where the comment line is preceded by only whitespace, resulting in indentation issues.
- The function should ensure that comments are formatted correctly and that empty lines are handled properly.
- The bug occurs when the function encounters an empty line or a line with only whitespace before a comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle empty lines or lines containing only whitespace.
2. Adjust the condition checks to correctly identify comment lines.
3. Ensure that the function preserves the correct formatting of comments while consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Handle non-empty lines only
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle comments correctly and pass the failing test cases.
