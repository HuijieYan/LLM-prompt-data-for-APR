### Bug explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrectly handling the indentation counting logic. The function is designed to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. However, the logic for counting the current column position based on spaces and tabs is flawed, leading to incorrect outcomes.

### Bug location
The issue lies in the logic block for handling spaces and tabs. The current handling of spaces and tabs for updating the `current_column` variable is causing the bug.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately count the column position based on spaces and tabs in the prefix string. The handling of spaces and tabs should correctly update the `current_column` variable.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update tab count to represent 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the column counting logic for tabs to increment by 4 instead of 1 to accurately track the column position in the prefix string.
