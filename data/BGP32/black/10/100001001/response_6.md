### Explanation of the bug:
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` lies in the condition for checking the indentation level. The function is designed to partially consume the prefix text up to a certain column index. However, the logic for handling whitespace characters like spaces and tabs to calculate the current column position is incorrect. This leads to incorrect calculations of the column position and causes the function to return the wrong consumed prefix text.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the logic for updating the `current_column` variable based on different types of characters encountered.
2. Ensure that the function correctly updates the `current_column` and `current_line` variables to consume the prefix up to the specified `column` value.
3. Handle different scenarios for spaces, tabs, and newline characters accurately to correctly calculate the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column for tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the calculations for the `current_column` variable and ensuring correct handling of whitespace characters, the corrected version of the function should now correctly consume the prefix text up to the specified column index.
