### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition for resetting `current_column` is incorrectly placed inside the `if wait_for_nl` block. This condition needs to be outside that block to ensure that `current_column` is reset whenever a new line character (`'\n'`) is encountered, regardless of the value of `wait_for_nl`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to move the condition to reset `current_column` for encountering `'\n'` outside the `if wait_for_nl` block so that it is always checked.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column when encountering a newline character
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By moving the condition to reset `current_column` outside the `if wait_for_nl` block, we ensure that it always gets reset when encountering a newline character. This correction should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
