### Bug explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the way the function is handling the case where the indentation is supposed to be finished. After encountering characters that are not spaces, tabs, or newlines, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to True. However, when reaching the end of the prefix string without encountering a newline, the function does not properly handle the end of the indentation and fails to return the correct values.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the function reaches the end of the prefix string without encountering a newline, it correctly handles the end of the indentation and returns the appropriate values.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # handle end of indentation
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the handling of the end of indentation after the loop finishes processing the prefix string, we ensure that the function returns the correct values even when it reaches the end of the input without encountering a newline character.
