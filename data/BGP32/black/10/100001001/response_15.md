The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` arises from not handling the case where `wait_for_nl` is True when the loop reaches the end of the `prefix` string. This results in the incomplete check for the column number, causing incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check after the loop to handle the case when `wait_for_nl` is True. This ensures that the condition for checking the column number is also evaluated at the end of the prefix string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    # Handles case when reaching the end of the prefix
    if wait_for_nl and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the case where `wait_for_nl` is True at the end of the `prefix` string, ensuring that the column number is checked properly.
