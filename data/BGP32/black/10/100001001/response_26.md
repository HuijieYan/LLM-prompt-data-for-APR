### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column position, considering spaces and tabs for indentation. However, there seems to be an issue with how it handles newlines and the logic for waiting for a newline before considering the column position.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character. In Case 1, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0, ignoring the existing indentation level. This leads to incorrect behavior when the column position is compared.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to handling newline characters. Instead of always resetting the `current_column` to 0 when a newline is encountered, we should only do so when the indentation is finished (i.e., when `wait_for_nl` is True). This way, we can preserve the existing indentation level and correctly track the column position.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level when encountering newlines and correctly consider the column position when determining the consumed prefix.
