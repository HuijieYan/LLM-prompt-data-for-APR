### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the condition for checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column is inverted. It should return the result if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column, but the code inside the if statement is doing the opposite.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition within the if statement to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column before returning the result.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Fix the condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
