### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling the indentation columns. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable when encountering spaces or tabs, which leads to miscalculations of the column position. This incorrect calculation prevents the function from correctly identifying when to return the consumed prefix.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` variable based on the encountered character. We should only increment `current_column` when encountering a tab character (`\t`), as it represents a single indentation level. Spaces should not contribute to the column count.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function should now accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column position and return the consumed prefix correctly.
