The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where it checks if the current character is a newline (`char == '\n'`). When this condition is true, the function mistakenly resets the `current_column` to 0, which is incorrect. The `current_column` should only be reset to 0 when encountering a newline character if the `wait_for_nl` flag is set.

To fix this bug, we need to move the reset of the `current_column` to 0 inside the block where `wait_for_nl` is set to True. This ensures that the column is only reset when we are waiting for a newline character as part of processing the indentation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This correction ensures that the `current_column` is reset to 0 only when encountering a newline character while waiting for it during indentation processing.
