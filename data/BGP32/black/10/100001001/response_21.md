## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix up to a specified column. However, the function fails to correctly handle cases where the prefix contains newline characters while considering the column constraint.

### Issues
1. The condition to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column is faulty. It should prevent appending an empty line to the `lines` list.
2. Misplacement of conditions results in incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters.

### Bug Causes
1. The function fails to detect and properly handle newline characters within the prefix, leading to incorrect line counting and column checking.
2. The condition to handle indentation being finished (`wait_for_nl = True`) is triggered incorrectly, affecting the correct processing of the prefix.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that newline characters are correctly handled during the prefix consumption process. Additionally, the condition for detecting the end of indentation needs to be adjusted to work as intended.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column while handling newline characters and indentation appropriately.
