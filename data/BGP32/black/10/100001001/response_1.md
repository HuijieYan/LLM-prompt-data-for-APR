### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs in the logic where the function is checking if the current character is a '\n' and if the wait_for_nl flag is set. In this case, if the current column is less than the specified column, it does not handle the situation correctly, causing incorrect output.

### Bug fixing strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions within the loop to properly handle the case when the current character is a newline character and the wait_for_nl flag is True.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adding a check for the current column when encountering a new line character and the wait_for_nl flag being True, we ensure that the function handles the case correctly and returns the desired output.
