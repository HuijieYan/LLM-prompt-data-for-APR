### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic to handle lines that are not empty does not correctly consider the column parameter. When the function encounters a newline character (`\n`), it checks if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the specified column. However, if there are spaces or tabs at the beginning of the line, the current column is not updated accordingly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the `current_column` correctly reflects the actual indentation level of the line, including spaces and tabs. We should update the `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs to accurately track the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now properly updates the `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs, ensuring that the column position is accurately tracked when determining whether to return the consumed prefix.
