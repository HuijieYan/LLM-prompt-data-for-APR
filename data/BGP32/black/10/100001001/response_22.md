The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for checking the column limit. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is incorrect because it should be checking if the `current_column` is greater than or equal to the `column` limit, not less than. This error causes the function to return prematurely and incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column`. This will ensure that the function correctly compares the current column with the specified column limit before returning the result.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the function properly consumes the prefix until the specified column limit is reached before returning the result.
