### Explanation of the Bug
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix string up to a certain column position. It keeps track of the lines and columns while processing the prefix. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the situation where the prefix ends before reaching the specified column.

In the provided cases:
- Case 1: The prefix ends after the comment, but the function incorrectly assumes it needs to wait for a newline character, leading to an incorrect result.
- Case 2: The prefix is empty, but the function does not handle this case properly, resulting in an incorrect return value.
- Case 3: The prefix ends after the comment, but the function incorrectly assumes it needs to wait for a newline character, leading to an incorrect result.
- Case 4: The prefix is empty, but the function does not handle this case properly, resulting in an incorrect return value.
- Case 5: The prefix ends after the comment, but the function incorrectly assumes it needs to wait for a newline character, leading to an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles reaching the end of the prefix before reaching the specified column. Specifically, we need to address the case where the prefix is exhausted without needing to wait for a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to check if the current column exceeds the specified column before setting `wait_for_nl` to `True`, the function will correctly handle cases where the prefix ends before reaching the desired column.
