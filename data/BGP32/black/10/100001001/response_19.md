### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition to check if the current line is empty and if the `current_column` is less than the provided `column` parameter. 

1. In Case 1, the logic inside the `wait_for_nl` condition is flawed. It checks if the character is a newline and if the `current_line` is not empty, but it doesn't consider the `current_column` condition correctly. Therefore, even when the `current_column` is less than the provided `column`, it prematurely returns before consuming the entire prefix.

2. In Case 2, when the `prefix` is empty, the function should return an empty string as the consumed portion, but it fails to do so.

3. In Case 3, the `\t` character is not handled correctly for updating the `current_column` count.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for checking if `current_column` is less than the provided `column` parameter within the `wait_for_nl` block. We also need to handle the case when the `prefix` is empty correctly and update the `current_column` when encountering a `\t` character.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip().replace('\t', ' ')*4 and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
