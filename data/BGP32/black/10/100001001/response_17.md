### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the conditions to check the column position and when to return the result. The current implementation fails to correctly handle cases where the column position exceeds the specified limit.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition where the function should return the result to include checking if the current column position is less than the specified limit.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles different types of indentation characters like tabs and spaces to accurately calculate the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the condition to include checking if the current column position is less than or equal to the specified limit, the corrected function will now handle cases where the column position reaches or exceeds the specified limit accurately.
