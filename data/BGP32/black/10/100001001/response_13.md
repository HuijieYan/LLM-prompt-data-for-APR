### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic related to handling indentation. When encountering a non-space character after a space character or tab, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, expecting the next character to be a new line. This causes the function to skip adding the current line to `lines` and resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` prematurely.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around the `wait_for_nl` condition. Instead of setting `wait_for_nl` immediately when encountering a non-space character, we should only set it after encountering a new line character following an indent. This way, the function correctly handles the end of an indentation block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
