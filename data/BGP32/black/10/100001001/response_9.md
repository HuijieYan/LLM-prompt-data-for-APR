### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column is misplaced. The function checks this condition only when encountering a newline character after a tab or space, but it should be checked after each character to ensure that the correct prefix is extracted.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, move the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column outside the `if wait_for_nl` block and inside the main loop of processing each character in the prefix. This way, the comparison is made after processing each character to ensure correctness.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        if current_column < column:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By moving the column comparison outside the `if wait_for_nl` block, the function now correctly checks after each character if the current column is less than the specified column and extracts the prefix accordingly. This corrected version should resolve the bug and return the expected results for all cases.
