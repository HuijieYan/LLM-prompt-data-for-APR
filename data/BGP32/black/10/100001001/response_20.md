### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached. However, there are a few issues causing it to fail in some cases:
1. In the `wait_for_nl` condition, when a newline character is encountered, and the current column is less than the specified column value, the function incorrectly returns `res` which is the join of `lines` without considering the current line. This leads to the loss of information present in the current line.
2. In the same condition mentioned above, after appending the current line to `lines`, `current_line` should be reset to an empty string to start constructing the next line.
3. In the case where a character is not a space, tab, or newline, it should not set `wait_for_nl` to True if `wait_for_nl` is already True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Adjust the logic in the `wait_for_nl` condition to correctly handle appending the current line and resetting it for the next iteration.
2. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is not set to True if it is already True and a non-space, tab, or newline character is encountered.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments to the logic, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string until the specified column value is reached.
