The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the case where the current column is less than the specified `column` parameter value. The function should consume characters until it reaches a newline character or the end of the prefix when the current column is less than the specified column value.

Based on the analysis of the runtime values and types of variables, we can see that in Case 1, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix and return the expected result. This is because the condition `current_column < column` is not correctly evaluating when the newline character is encountered.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the loop that checks for the condition where `current_column` is less than `column` and return the appropriate result. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles the case where the current column is less than the specified column value and returns the correct result.
