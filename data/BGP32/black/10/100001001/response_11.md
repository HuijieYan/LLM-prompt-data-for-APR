### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect. If the condition is true, the function should return the consumed prefix. However, the current implementation returns the consumed lines up to that point.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the condition to compare `current_column` with the specified `column` needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the handling of the last line needs to be corrected to properly return the remaining prefix. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

By making the corrections in the condition for comparing the current column with the specified column, and ensuring the correct handling of the last line, the function should now work correctly and return the expected results for the given test cases.
