### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the condition for checking if the column is less than the specified column value is handled. The current implementation checks if the current column is less than the specified column only after encountering a newline character. This results in incorrect behavior when the specified column is reached before a newline character.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition for checking the column value against the specified column should be moved outside the `wait_for_nl` block. This way, the column value can be checked as each character is processed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False

        if not wait_for_nl:
            if current_column < column:
                if char in ['\n', '\t']:
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            else:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        if char == ' ':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the specified column correctly without relying solely on encountering a newline character.
