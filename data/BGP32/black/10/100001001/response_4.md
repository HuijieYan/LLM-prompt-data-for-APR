### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not handle the case where the prefix ends before reaching the expected column. As a result, in such cases, the function returns an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the prefix ends before reaching the expected column, the function correctly returns the accumulated lines and the remaining prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res) + 1:]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adding a check when encountering a newline character to see if the current column is less than the expected column, we can ensure that the function handles cases where the prefix ends before reaching the expected column. This fix will provide the correct result in such situations.
