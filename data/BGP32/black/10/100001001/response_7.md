### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the condition checking for the end of an indent (when `char` is not a space or tab) and setting `wait_for_nl` to `True` is incorrect. This condition should only be executed when `wait_for_nl` is `False`, indicating that the function is waiting for a new line character to mark the end of the current indent. However, in the provided code, this condition is not properly linked to the `wait_for_nl` flag.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for setting `wait_for_nl` to `True` to only trigger when `wait_for_nl` is already `False`. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the end of an indent and waits for a new line character to mark its completion.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly set and reset to accurately handle the end of indents and new line characters.
