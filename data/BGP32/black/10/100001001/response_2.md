### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. However, there are issues with how it handles whitespace characters and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when encountering a newline character (`\n`), causing the function to incorrectly handle or skip over the remaining prefix. This results in incorrect behavior when determining the substring that should be consumed.

### Bug Cause:
The `wait_for_nl` flag does not reset properly after encountering a newline character, leading to premature termination of consuming the prefix.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset appropriately after encountering a newline character, allowing the function to correctly consume the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_line and current_column
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` and setting `wait_for_nl` to `False` when encountering a newline character, the function will consume the prefix correctly based on the column position.
