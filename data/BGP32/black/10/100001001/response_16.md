The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles whitespace characters and line breaks while counting columns. In particular, the condition for `wait_for_nl` flag seems to be incorrectly triggered.

The issue can be identified in the `wait_for_nl` condition check. When handling whitespace characters, there's no reset of the `wait_for_nl` flag, causing the function to incorrectly wait for a newline character to reset the counting logic. This results in missing the appropriate count for the column and returning incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the `wait_for_nl` flag needs to be reset after handling any whitespace character like space or tab. This will ensure that the column counting logic is reset correctly. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset appropriately when handling whitespace characters, fixing the column counting bug.
