### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column value. It processes each character from the prefix, determining whether to consume it based on its type (space, tab, newline) and the current column count. However, the function has a bug where it incorrectly handles cases where a newline character is encountered before consuming the specified column width.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 1, when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) in the prefix string before reaching the specified column value, it does not clear the `current_line` and does not update the `current_column` count. This leads to incorrect processing of the prefix string. The current implementation does not properly reset these values when encountering a newline character.
- Similarly, in Case 3, when a newline character is preceded by a tab character (`\t`), the function incorrectly appends the current line to the `lines` list without clearing `current_line` and updating `current_column`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the following changes can be implemented:
1. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), reset the `current_line` and reset the `current_column` count to 0.
2. Update the logic to handle newline characters correctly by ensuring that the `current_line` is handled appropriately before adding it to the `lines` list.
3. Make sure that after consuming the prefix string up to the specified column value, the remaining part of the prefix is correctly returned.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column value, handling newline characters appropriately.
