### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column. The bug occurs because the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect. The condition should not only check if the current column is less than the specified column but also if the line is not empty.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition inside the `wait_for_nl` block to correctly check if the current column is less than the specified column and if the line is not empty before consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res)+1:]

            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version includes the necessary check for an empty line before deciding whether to consume the prefix based on the specified column.
