### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume characters from the given `prefix` until reaching a line break (`\n`) at a specific `column` index. The function is expected to return two strings: the consumed characters from the beginning of the `prefix` until the line break at the specified `column`, and the remaining characters after that.

The bug is likely causing incorrect behavior in identifying the line breaks and handling them when adding characters to the `lines` list.

### Identified Errors:
1. The condition to handle the line break is not properly resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` variables.
2. The condition to handle indentation after encountering a non-space character is not correctly setting `wait_for_nl` to continue consuming characters until the line break in the specified `column`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of line breaks after encountering an indentation during character consumption. This results in the consumed characters after the specified column not being separated from the rest of the prefix correctly.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a line break is encountered after the current line exceeds the specified column, we correctly split the consumed characters until that point separately from the remaining prefix. Additionally, resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` variables after encountering a line break is essential to correctly consume the next line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
          
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
          
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle consuming characters up to the specified column index and return the consumed and remaining parts of the prefix as expected, passing the failing test cases.
