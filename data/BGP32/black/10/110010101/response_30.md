### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. The bug seems to be related to the handling of newline characters. The function should accumulate characters until a newline character is encountered, then it should evaluate if the accumulated line exceeds the column limit.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises when processing newline characters. The current implementation is incorrect, as it doesn't update the `lines` list correctly when encountering a newline character. This results in incorrect indentation levels and line breaks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly split the accumulated lines and handle newlines based on the column limit. We should accumulate characters in `current_line` until a newline is encountered, then compare the accumulated line's length with the specified column. If the accumulated line exceeds the column limit, we need to start a new line and update the `lines` list accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that new lines are correctly handled based on the specified column limit, updating the `lines` list accordingly.
