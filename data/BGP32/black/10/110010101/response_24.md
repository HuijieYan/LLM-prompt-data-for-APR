### Analysis
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a prefix up to a specific column and return the consumed part and the remaining part.
2. The function keeps track of the current line being filled by characters from the prefix, the current column count, and whether it should wait for a new line.
3. The bug causes the function to omit the trailing comment indentation in some cases, leading to failing tests.
4. The bug arises when the function encounters a newline during processing and should reset the column count, but it does not handle the waiting for newline condition correctly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly reset the column count and waiting condition when encountering a newline character.

### Plan for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the logic inside the if block for the '\n' character to properly reset the column count and waiting condition.
2. Update the loop to handle the waiting for newline condition correctly.

### Corrected Function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected function now properly resets the column count and waiting condition when encountering a newline character, fixing the bug that caused the failing tests.
