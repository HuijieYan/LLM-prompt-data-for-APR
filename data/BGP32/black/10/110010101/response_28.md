### Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume characters from the input `prefix` string until a line ends at the given `column` position. However, there are multiple issues in the function:
1. The condition to check if a line ends (`current_line.strip()` and `current_column < column`) is incorrect.
2. The logic to handle tabs (`\t`) and spaces (` `) in determining the current column position is incorrect.
3. The handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag is incorrect, leading to incorrect line breaks and indentations.

### Bug Cause
1. The current condition to determine if the line has reached the given column is flawed, which leads to premature line breaking.
2. Incorrect handling of tab spaces and spaces leads to wrong calculations for the `current_column` position.
3. Incorrect management of the `wait_for_nl` flag results in unexpected line breaks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the condition to correctly check if the current line has reached the desired column position.
2. Adjust the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tabs or spaces.
3. Fix the logic around the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure proper line breaking.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the column position for tabs

        if char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:  # Updated condition for correct line breaking
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), current_line

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the conditions and calculations to ensure that the line breaks at the correct positions based on the given column. It also properly handles tabs and spaces in determining the current column position.
