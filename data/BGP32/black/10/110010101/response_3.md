### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the prefix until the specified column is reached. However, there is a bug in the logic causing it to handle empty lines inconsistently, resulting in an unexpected output. The function is not correctly handling the case where the current line is empty when it encounters a newline character. This leads to the incorrect indentation level in the final output.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug occurs when the current line is empty (`current_line = ""`) and a newline character `'\n'` is encountered in the input prefix. 
2. In this scenario, the function should reset the `current_column` to `0` to handle the beginning of a new line properly. 
3. However, the current implementation does not reset the `current_column`, leading to incorrect indentation calculations and output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic around handling newline characters when the current line is empty. Specifically, when the function encounters a newline while the `current_line` is empty, it should reset `current_column` to `0` to correctly handle the next line's indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if not current_line.strip() or current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""  # Reset current line for empty lines
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle empty lines correctly and produce the expected output for all cases.
