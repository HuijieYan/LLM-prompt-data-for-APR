### Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to partially consume a given prefix string based on the specified column value. It processes the input prefix character by character, updating various variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` based on certain conditions. However, the function fails to handle all cases correctly, leading to the mismatch in the test output.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect logic for handling indentation levels of spaces and tabs.
2. Incorrect condition for checking the ending of indentation versus new lines.
3. Inconsistent handling of the current line, resulting in potential inaccuracies.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a comment within the given prefix input. The incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines causes the unexpected behavior, leading to incorrect output. Specifically, the function does not correctly determine when an indentation level finishes and when a new line should start.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that all types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs) are handled consistently.
2. Update the logic for identifying the end of an indentation level and the beginning of a new line correctly.
3. Maintain the integrity of the current line when processing the given prefix.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update indentation level for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By enhancing the logic to accurately handle indentation levels, new lines, and comments within the prefix string, the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test case.
