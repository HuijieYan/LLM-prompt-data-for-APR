### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` attempts to consume a prefix until a certain column is reached, splitting the prefix into consumed lines and remaining content.
- The function has an issue where it incorrectly handles the case when `\n` is encountered.
- The function does not properly handle the case when a newline character is reached, resulting in incorrect indentation measurement.
- The bug leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix causing unexpected results.

### Bug
When the function encounters a newline character ('\n'), it sets the `current_column` to 0 without checking if the line is an empty line or if it should influence the splitting of the prefix. This leads to incorrect calculations of the `current_column`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle the case when a newline character is encountered.
2. Update the `current_column` based on whether the line is empty or not.
3. Ensure that the newline character handling does not interfere with the correct splitting of the prefix.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the newline character correctly, leading to the correct splitting of the prefix and satisfying the expected input/output values for all test cases.
