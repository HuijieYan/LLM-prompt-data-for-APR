### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix while considering the indentation level based on Python syntax rules.
2. The function processes each character in the prefix and builds lines based on the indentation level. It handles space, tab, and newline characters to determine the end of a line.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line after passing through some indentation spaces. It incorrectly handles the comment line's whitespace, leading to a mismatch in the output.
4. To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the comment line's whitespace and correctly combine the lines. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for handling comment lines to ensure the correct behavior of line concatenation.
2. Modify the way the function processes characters to correctly track the line's current state and indentation level.
3. Ensure that the resulting lines are correctly combined and returned with the remaining prefix for further processing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # Check if the previous line was indented and if it has a comment
            if current_line.strip() and '#' in current_line[current_column:]:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to correctly handle comment lines in relation to the indentation level, the corrected version addresses the bug and should now pass the failing test cases.
