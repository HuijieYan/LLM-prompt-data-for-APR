### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be designed to process a prefix string by consuming characters based on indentation rules until a specific column limit is reached. However, the bug seems to be related to the handling of newlines within the prefix string.

### Error Location
The error likely arises when the function encounters a newline character without waiting for a newline. This results in comments not being correctly handled.

### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the function to incorrectly process the input string when encountering newlines. This results in comments being misplaced or removed in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic related to processing newlines within the prefix string. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are correctly handled when encountering newlines.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The updated class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the logic when encountering newline characters to appropriately handle comments and ensure the correct output based on the expected cases provided. With these modifications, the function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected results.
