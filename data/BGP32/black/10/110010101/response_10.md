### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column. The provided error message from the failing test indicates that the function does not correctly handle consuming the prefix up to the relevant column when encountering comments.

#### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be related to how the function deals with comment lines when determining the prefix to consume.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line and fails to properly extract the prefix up to the specified column. This results in incorrectly consuming the prefix beyond the expected position, leading to a mismatch between the actual and expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles comment lines and does not consume the prefix beyond the specified column. Additionally, we should address the logic for calculating the column position when encountering different characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle consuming the prefix up to the specified column even when encountering comment lines. It addresses the logic for handling different characters and ensures that the prefix is correctly extracted.
