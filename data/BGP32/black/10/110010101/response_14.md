### Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit. The bug seems to be related to handling newlines and preserving the indentation properly.

### Error Location
The error seems to occur when a comment is reached and the function incorrectly consumes the newline character, causing a misalignment in the output.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by prematurely consuming the newline character when encountering a comment. This breaks the indentation levels and results in incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to handling comments and newlines to correctly preserve the indentations and ensure that the comment is placed in the correct line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle prefixes containing comments, preserving the required indentation levels. This should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
