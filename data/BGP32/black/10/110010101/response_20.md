### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to take a `prefix` string and a `column` integer and partially consume the prefix up to the specified column, returning the consumed portion and the remaining portion.
- The function keeps track of the current line being constructed, the column count within that line, and whether it needs to wait for a new line.
- The bug seems to be related to handling newline characters and indentations within the prefix string.
- The function should return the consumed text correctly up to the specified column.

### Bug Explanation
1. When a newline character is encountered, the function mistakenly calculates the `current_column` count as 0 instead of retaining the current count.
2. There is an issue with handling the case when encountering a newline character after reaching the desired `column`.
3. The character `'#'`, in this context, marks giving up any further indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering a newline character.
2. Correct the logic for consuming the prefix up to the specified column.
3. Ensure that the consumed text is correctly returned.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line in result
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle behavior when reaching desired column
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Stop further indentation
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
