## Analysis
- The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class.
- The error message is an assertion error in the test case `test_comment_indentation`.
- The function is intended to consume a prefix string until a specified column is reached.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles newline characters.
- The function should correctly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines to consume the prefix string up to a certain column index.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug arises when encountering a newline character (`\n`). In the current implementation, when a newline is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to 0, which is incorrect if we are still waiting to consume the prefix up to a certain column.

## Proposed Fix
- When a newline character is encountered, the function should not reset `current_column` immediately. Instead, it should check if it has to wait for a newline to proceed, and only if waiting for newline should the `current_column` be set to 0.

## Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now handle newline characters appropriately to consume the prefix as expected.
