### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on specified column indentation. The function iterates through the prefix string character by character, building up lines until the specified column is reached. However, there is a bug where it fails to handle comments correctly, as seen in the failing test with comments not being properly consumed.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of comments and newlines.
2. Incorrect updating of `lines` list.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when a comment is encountered in the prefix string. The function fails to correctly handle lines with comments and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior and failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic to handle comments properly and ensure that they are consumed and processed correctly.
2. Update the `lines` list correctly based on the logic for handling comments and newlines.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle comments, whitespace, and newlines correctly to pass the failing test cases.
