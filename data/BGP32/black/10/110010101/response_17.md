### Analysis
In the provided buggy function, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column value. The function reads each character in the prefix and appends it to `current_line`. If it encounters a space or tab character, it updates `current_column` accordingly. It also tracks the state to wait for a newline character to mark the end of the indentation.

The bug in the function is related to handling the newline character and updating the `current_column` value. When the function encounters a newline character and the indentation is not completed, it should reset the `current_column` variable to 0. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character in the middle of indentation. In such cases, the `current_column` variable is not reset properly. This leads to incorrect calculation of the column position, causing the output to deviate from the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered in the middle of the indentation, the `current_column` variable is reset to 0. Additionally, we should handle the case when the current line is empty after consuming the prefix and return it along with the consumed lines.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug related to handling newline characters and indentation within the prefix should be resolved. The function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
