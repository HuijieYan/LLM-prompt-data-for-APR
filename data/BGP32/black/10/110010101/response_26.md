## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume part of a prefix based on a given column value. The function iterates through the characters of the prefix and accumulates them in `current_line`. When it encounters certain characters (`' '`, `'\t'`, `'\n'`), it adjusts the `current_column` value accordingly. If it encounters a non-indentation character, it sets `wait_for_nl` to True, indicating that it is expecting a new line.

The bug in the function seems to be related to handling the case when `wait_for_nl` is True. The function should consume the prefix only up to the specified column value and then return the consumed prefix.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the function is due to how it is handling the case when `wait_for_nl` is True. When encountering a new line while `wait_for_nl` is True, the function is not correctly checking if the `current_column` is less than the specified `column` value. This causes incorrect consumption of the prefix and incorrect results.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column value when `wait_for_nl` is True. This involves checking the `current_column` against the specified `column` and only returning the consumed prefix up to that point.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the check `if current_column < column:` after encountering a new line while `wait_for_nl` is True, we ensure that the function correctly handles consuming the prefix up to the specified column value. This will fix the bug and allow the function to return the correct consumed prefix.
