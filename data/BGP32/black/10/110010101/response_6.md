### Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on the specified column. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect tracking of indentation levels and handling of newline characters.

### Error location
1. The logic for handling spaces and tabs to update `current_column` seems correct.
2. The logic for checking newline characters and splitting lines seems buggy, especially when `wait_for_nl` is True.
3. There is an issue with updating the `res` variable and returning the correct result.
4. The logic for updating `current_line` when reaching a newline character might be incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to arise from how the function handles indentations at the end of lines and how it separates lines based on column values. The failing test suggests that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix string up to the specified column.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the indentations for spaces and tabs.
2. Correctly separate lines based on the provided column value.
3. Ensure that the `res` variable captures the consumed prefix correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        # Add the last line
        lines.append(current_line)

        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

The corrected version should now correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column and pass the failing test cases.
