## Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a part of the input string `prefix` up to a certain column value. The function loops through each character in the `prefix` string, counting the number of spaces, tabs, and newlines encountered until it reaches the desired column. However, there is an issue with the condition to handle newline characters that results in the incorrect output during the failing test.

## Identified Issue
The issue is with the condition for the newline character (`\n`) inside the loop. When a newline character is encountered, the current_column should be reset to zero. However, in the current implementation, for the case when `current_line.strip()` returns True (indicating there are non-space characters before the newline), the function immediately returns without resetting the `current_column`. This causes incorrect behavior when the next line is processed.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that after a non-empty line ending with a newline is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to zero. Additionally, the `wait_for_nl` flag should be reset to False after processing such a line.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column and wait_for_nl flag if non-empty line is finished
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected outputs for the failing test cases.
