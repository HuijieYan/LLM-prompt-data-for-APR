### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. It iterates through the prefix character by character, updating the current line, column information, and waiting for a newline character.
2. The function seems to have issues with correctly handling spaces, tabs, and newline characters when updating the current line and column values.
3. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output when consuming the prefix. The issue seems to be related to handling indentation and comments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles indentation, tabs, and newline characters, especially when encountering comments.
5. We need to adjust the logic of updating the current line and column values based on the characters encountered in the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for calculating the current column when encountering spaces and tabs.
2. Handle the case when encountering a newline character and correctly update the current line.
3. Adjust the conditions for waiting for a newline and checking the column value.
4. Ensure that comments are correctly handled during the prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if len(current_line) - 1 < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By applying these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the prefix consumption based on the given column value and correctly update the current line and column values.
