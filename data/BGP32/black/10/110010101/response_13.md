### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix string based on a given column value.
- The function iterates over the characters in the prefix string, updating the current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl variables based on the characters encountered.
- Once a certain condition is met (`wait_for_nl = True`), it will return the consumed lines and the remaining portion of the prefix string.
- The provided error message indicates a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the function, specifically related to the comment indentation.
- The expected input/output values provide insights into the expected behavior of the function across different scenarios.

### Bug Identification
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character ('\n') while waiting for a newline to complete the indentation.
- The expected behavior in this case is to handle the indentation of the comment correctly and continue processing the prefix string.
- The bug causes an incorrect handling of the indentation level, leading to incorrect consumed lines in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of newline characters when waiting for a newline to complete the indentation.
- The function should keep track of the indent level correctly and continue processing the prefix string after handling the comment correctly.
- By updating the logic to properly handle indentation and newline characters, we can ensure the consumed lines are correctly determined.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if not current_line.strip() or current_column >= column:
                        if current_line.strip():
                            lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if char == '\n':
                    if not current_line.strip() or current_column >= column:
                        if current_line.strip():
                            lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                    else:
                        wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion
The corrected function adjusts the logic within the `if char == '\n':` block to ensure correct handling of the comment indentation and proper progress through the prefix string. This correction addresses the bug identified and aligns the function's behavior with the expected input/output values for different scenarios.
