### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is designed to partially consume a given prefix string up to a specified indentation level defined by the `column` parameter.
2. The function initializes variables to keep track of the current line, current column position, and whether it is waiting for a new line. It then iterates through the characters of the input prefix and consumes parts of it according to the indentation rules.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly handling cases where an unexpected empty line occurs during the prefix consumption process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function incorrectly resetting the `current_column` value to 0 when it encounters a newline character (`\n`) that is not part of the expected indentation level. This reset causes the logic for consuming indentation to be disrupted, leading to incorrect results during prefix consumption.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value is not reset to 0 when encountering an unexpected empty line. Instead, the function should continue consuming characters based on the expected indentation level.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the bug related to unexpected empty lines causing incorrect prefix consumption should be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
