### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached.
2. The function iterates through each character of the prefix, updating the `current_line` and `current_column`. It will append lines only when a new line character is found and the required column is not exceeded.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of comments in the input prefix, leading to incorrect indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic related to dealing with comments and line breaks. Specifically, when waiting for a new line, the function should correctly check if the current column exceeds the required column before adding the line.
5. We should also ensure that the characters of comments are correctly handled and indentation levels are maintained as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for handling new line characters and comments to preserve indentation.
2. Adjust the condition for adding lines to ensure correct indentation is maintained.
3. Update the current line and column in the appropriate cases.
4. Ensure proper handling of spaces, tabs, and new lines for accurate indentation.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""

        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False 
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:                
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True  # Start waiting for the new line when encountering a comment
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # Indent is finished
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to handling comments and new lines, ensuring correct behavior with respect to preserving indentation levels.
