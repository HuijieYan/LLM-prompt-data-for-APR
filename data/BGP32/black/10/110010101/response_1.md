### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on the provided column value. The function iterates through the characters in the prefix, updating the current line, column, and handling different characters based on their type.

The bug in the function seems to arise when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) while waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl` is `True`). The expected behavior is to check if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the specified `column`. If so, the function should return the consumed portion of the prefix and the remaining part. However, based on the failing test output, it seems that the comment indentation is not handled correctly, leading to a mismatch in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct logic is followed when a newline character is encountered. Specifically, we need to handle the indentation of comments correctly to ensure the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the handling of newline characters both inside and outside the wait condition, we ensure that the correct behavior is maintained for scenario where a new line is encountered partway through indentation. This adjusted logic should address the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test cases.
