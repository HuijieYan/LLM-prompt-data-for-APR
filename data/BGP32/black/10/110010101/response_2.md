### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit. It processes each character in the prefix string, keeping track of the current line, column, and the need to wait for a new line.
2. The function returns a string constructed from lines that meet the column limit condition.
3. The bug occurs when encountering a '\n' character in the prefix string. The function incorrectly switches to waiting for a new line even though it should continue processing the current line if the column limit is not reached.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the '\n' character based on the column count and only switches to waiting for a new line if necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of handling the '\n' character within the loop to correctly process the line based on the column count.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = current_column >= column
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

Now, with the corrected logic in place, the function should correctly process the prefix string up to the specified column limit and handle new lines properly. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
