### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column number. It iterates over each character in the prefix string and attempts to split it into lines based on the column number. However, it fails to correctly handle indentation levels and line breaks, leading to incorrect behavior.

The error message indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output for the test case involving comment indentation. This suggests that the function is not correctly consuming the prefix string up to the specified column number in certain cases involving indentation changes.

### Error Location
The error is likely occurring due to incorrect tracking of indentation levels and handling of line breaks within the prefix string. The function fails to properly recognize when a new line has started based on the provided column number. This leads to discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.

### Bug Cause
- The function fails to correctly handle indentation levels (tabs and spaces) when determining the start of a new line.
- Incorrect handling of new lines (\n) and whitespace characters within the prefix string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column position based on different whitespace characters.
2. Properly handle the logic for identifying the start of a new line, taking into account the specified column number.
3. Update the logic for tracking the current line and appending lines to the output list.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version updates the logic for handling indentation levels and new lines, ensuring that the function correctly consumes the prefix string up to the specified column number. This version should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
