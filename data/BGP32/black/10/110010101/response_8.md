### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column width. 
2. The function keeps track of the current line being constructed, the current column position, and waits for a newline character to determine when to stop.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a space or tab character while waiting for a newline character, resulting in the premature stopping of the current line.
4. The premature stopping causes incorrect handling of the indent level, leading to incorrect output.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current line is only stopped when encountering a newline character when all conditions are met.
6. The function should properly update the current column and line based on encountered characters until it reaches the specified column width.

### Bugs
1. Premature stopping of the current line when encountering a space or tab character while still waiting for a newline character.
2. Incorrectly handling the current column width causing incorrect indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic to ensure that the current line is stopped only when the criteria for reaching the column width are met.
2. Update the current column and line based on the encountered characters to maintain the correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the conditions for stopping the current line and updating the column count correctly, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
