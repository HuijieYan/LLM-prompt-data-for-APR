### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` takes a `prefix` string and a `column` integer as input.
- The function processes the `prefix` string by splitting it into lines and accounting for indentation based on spaces, tabs, and line breaks.
- The function has a bug where it incorrectly handles the indentation and newline characters.
- The bug causes an incorrect output in which the comment is not properly aligned in certain scenarios.

### Bug in the Code
- The bug occurs in the `elif char == '\n':` block, where `current_column` is not reset correctly for every new line.
- This leads to incorrect indentation calculations, especially when there are multiple consecutive newlines in the `prefix` string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the newline character in a way that correctly resets the `current_column` counter.
- We need to ensure that `current_column` is properly reset to 0 every time a new line is encountered.
- Additionally, we need to handle cases where an empty line should not be considered for indentation calculation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    # Unexpected non-empty line, reset indentation
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset indentation for a new line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
    
```

After applying the suggested fix, the corrected function should handle the indentation and newline characters correctly, producing the expected output for all test cases provided.
