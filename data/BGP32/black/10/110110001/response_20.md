### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling indentation and newlines may not be correctly updating the current column and lines list.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag may not be toggling correctly leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The condition for checking if the current line is empty and the column is less than the target column might be flawed.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until it reaches a target indentation column. However, the function fails to correctly handle indentation levels and newlines when encountering spaces, tabs, and newline characters. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to extract the prefix up to a certain column.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` focuses on testing if the function can properly format code indentation, particularly when dealing with comments. The error message highlights a mismatch between the expected and actual formatted code strings, indicating that the function is not producing the correct output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `current_column` and `current_line` variables are updated appropriately based on the characters encountered.
2. Reset the `current_line` and adjust the column count when encountering newline characters.
3. Toggle the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly to control when to stop consuming the prefix.
4. Verify the conditions for handling empty lines and column comparisons.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = char
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrections above, the function should now properly consume the prefix string up to the specified column and handle various scenarios involving indentation and newlines. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
