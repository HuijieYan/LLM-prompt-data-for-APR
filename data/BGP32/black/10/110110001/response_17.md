### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue with handling the indentation levels for tabs and spaces. This issue leads to an incorrect result when extracting part of the code prefix. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights the problem when comparing the expected contents with the actual result after processing the code prefix.

The function fails to properly handle the case where lines with different indentations are followed by a comment. This causes a mismatch in the output due to incorrect handling of indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the handling of indentation levels for tabs and spaces is correctly accounted for when parsing the code prefix. Properly detecting the end of an indentation level and correctly handling the wait-for-newline flag will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By improving the logic in the corrected version, the function should now be able to properly handle different levels of indentation and correctly extract the desired code prefix.
