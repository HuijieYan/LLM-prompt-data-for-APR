### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class under `blib2to3` package. It seems like this function is used to consume the prefix of a given string up to a specified column indentation.
2. The failing test case is checking how comments are handled in different indentations. It expects the string with tabs and spaces to be treated the same.
3. The error message shows a mismatch in the expected and actual output due to comments being handled differently. The bug seems to be related to how comments are processed in the function, leading to inconsistent results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how comments are treated in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure consistent indentation handling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Change the logic of handling comments to correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column without affecting the comment lines. 
- We can achieve this by ensuring that comments are not counted towards column indentation when skipping empty lines or whitespaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        if current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        else:
                            lines.append(current_line)
                            current_line = ""
                            current_column = 0
                            wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

By making these adjustments to the logic of skipping comments and empty lines, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
