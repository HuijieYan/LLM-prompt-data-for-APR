### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation levels in the input prefix string. This is causing incorrect splitting of lines.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` expects the correct output for different indentation levels, but it fails due to the incorrect behavior of the buggy function.
3. The error message shows a comparison between the expected output and the actual output. The incorrect behavior of the buggy function results in incorrect line splits, leading to the assertion failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Make sure to correctly handle the indentation levels when splitting lines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
2. The function should separate lines based on the specified column value, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles indentation and respects the column specification to split the lines accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the handling of tabs and indentation in the `elif char == '\t':` block, we can ensure that the lines are split correctly based on the specified column value. This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
