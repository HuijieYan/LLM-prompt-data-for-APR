### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class has a bug causing incorrect indentation handling.
2. **Bug Location**: The bug seems to be located in the logic related to handling white spaces, tabs, and new lines while constructing and consuming lines in the `prefix`.
3. **Error Explanation**: The error occurs because the function does not handle the case where a comment is in between an indent, resulting in the mismatch of expected and actual outputs.
4. **Fixing Strategy**: We need to properly handle the case where there is a comment in the middle of an indent. Adjust the logic to correctly consume and build lines when encountering comments.

### Code Correction:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl for each new line
            elif char == '#':  # Handle comment case
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle comments as separate lines with proper indentation, the corrected version of the function should now be able to pass the failing test.
