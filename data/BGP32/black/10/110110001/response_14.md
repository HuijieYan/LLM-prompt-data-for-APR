### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on the provided column value.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the indentation of comments in a string using the buggy function.
- The error message shows a failing assertion due to incorrect handling of comments in the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect column tracking logic.
2. Improper handling of newline characters.
3. Issues with detecting indentation completion.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises when the function encounters a comment line after consuming prefix characters. The function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level after encountering the comment, leading to the observed mismatch in the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level after encountering a comment. It should reset the current column value based on the comment's indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

                if char == '#':
                    # adjust column after encountering a comment
                    current_column = max(0, current_column - 1)

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adjusting the 'current_column' value when encountering a '#' character for comments, the corrected function should now handle comments within the prefix string correctly and pass the failing test.
