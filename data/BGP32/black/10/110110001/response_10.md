### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a portion of the input `prefix` text based on a given `column`. It splits the text into lines based on indentation and newlines.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function can correctly format code with comments in varying levels of indentation.
- The error message indicates an assertion failure because the actual output from the function does not match the expected output when dealing with comment indentation.

### Bug:
- The cause of the bug lies in the logic where the function determines when to wait for a newline character. This logic seems to be incorrect when handling comments with different levels of indentation.
- The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 upon encountering a newline character, which affects the subsequent indentations and line splitting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic inside the loop where the function iterates over each character in the `prefix` text.
- Modify the conditions for checking indentations and handling newline characters to ensure proper formatting of lines with different levels of indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After replacing the buggy function with the corrected version, the function should now correctly handle indentation and newline characters, allowing it to format code with comments correctly.
