### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix string based on certain conditions.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare the output of the function for two different types of indentation.
3. The error message indicates that the actual output is not matching the expected output due to an issue with comment indentation.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of comment lines in the `prefix`.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function fails to handle the case where there is a comment line (starting with `#`) in the given `prefix`.
- As a result, the function incorrectly consumes the indentation of the comment line before waiting for a newline character.
  
### Bug Fix:
- Modify the function to correctly handle comment lines by not counting whitespace or tabs in the comment.
- Adjust the logic to properly process comment lines without affecting the indentation count.
  
### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':  # handle comment line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above correction, the function should now handle comment lines properly without consuming the comment's whitespace as indentation. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
