### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string until a certain column is reached, handling indentation and newlines correctly.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing two versions of Python code with different indentation styles, expecting them to be equal.
3. The error message indicates that the prefix consumed by the function is not returning the expected results, leading to a mismatch between the two versions of the Python code.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation levels and line breaks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines. When encountering a newline character before reaching the specified column, the function does not correctly update the current line in the variable `lines`, leading to incorrect results when comparing the consumed prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels and newlines. Specifically, when encountering a newline character before the column limit is reached, the current line should be added to the `lines` list before moving to the next line.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Check column limit before adding to lines
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Add current line to lines before resetting
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrected version of the function, it now correctly handles newline characters and updates the `lines` list when needed, ensuring that the consumed prefix is processed accurately.
