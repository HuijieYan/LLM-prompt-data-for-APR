## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on a specified column.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the behavior of the function with different indentation styles in the input contents.
- The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output when the function is called with `fs(contents_tab)`.

## Bug Location:
- The bug may be related to the way the function handles indentation levels and newlines. It seems like the handling of indentation levels and waiting for a newline is causing the issue.

## Bug Cause:
- The function is not correctly handling the case when there is a comment line in the input content at the same indentation as the previous lines.
- When encountering a comment line, the function incorrectly considers it as a different line instead of part of the current line due to the waiting for a newline logic.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle comment lines at the same indentation as the previous lines.
- Modify the conditional statements related to handling spaces, tabs, and newlines to ensure proper tracking of the current line.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections to the function, it should now correctly handle comment lines at the same indentation level within the prefix string. This should address the issue identified in the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
