### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error where it fails to properly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment. This leads to incorrect behavior in the test case `test_comment_indentation`.
2. The error occurs when the function encounters a comment and does not adjust the current column properly, leading to incorrect slicing of the input prefix.
3. The failing test for `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare formatted strings with and without comments. The error message indicates that the actual and expected outputs do not match due to incorrect comment handling.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle comments correctly and make sure the indentation levels are preserved accordingly.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if ' ' not in current_line and current_column > column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version has additional logic to handle the case when encountering a comment character '#' and correctly adjust the current column position. This fix should ensure that the function handles comments and maintains the correct indentation levels, allowing it to pass the failing test.
