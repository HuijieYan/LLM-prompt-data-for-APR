1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a bug related to handling indentation levels and comment lines. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix up to a certain column. However, it fails to correctly handle comment lines with different indentation levels.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares two different code snippets with different indentation styles, which should be considered equivalent by the function. But the function fails to produce the expected output, resulting in an assertion error.

2. Error Location:
- The bug seems to be related to the logic that checks for waiting for a new line after indentation is finished and how it handles comment lines.

3. Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when a comment line follows an indented block and the indentation level of the comment line differs from the previous block, the function incorrectly consumes the prefix, leading to mismatched results in the failing test. The function does not correctly handle the transition between indented blocks and comment lines.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic around handling comment lines in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the function should properly distinguish between different levels of indentation while consuming the prefix.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
                continue
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the corrections above, the function should now correctly handle the consumption of prefix lines, including comment lines with various indentation levels, and pass the failing test.
