### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix string based on the column value provided. The function is expected to return the consumed and remaining parts of the prefix string. The issue lies in how the function handles indentation levels when consuming the prefix.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the section where checking for spaces, tabs, or newlines to update the current column and determine whether to consume the prefix further. The incorrect handling of whitespace characters and newline characters is causing the bug.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function does not handle newline characters correctly when determining the beginning of a new line. The incorrect logic for resetting the current column and waiting for a newline character leads to incorrect results when consuming the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that newline characters reset the current column to 0 and signify the beginning of a new line. This way, we can accurately determine the start of a new line and handle indentation levels correctly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that newline characters reset the current column properly and handle the beginning of a new line correctly. The function should now be able to consume the prefix based on the given column value as expected.
