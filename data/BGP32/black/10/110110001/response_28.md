### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given `prefix` string up to a certain `column` value.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the expected indentation of comments between `'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'` and `'if 1:\n    if 2:\n        pass\n    # comment\n    pass\n'`.
- The error message indicates that the indentation of the comment is incorrect in the consumed `prefix` string, leading to the assertion failure.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling indentation spaces/tabs might be incorrect, leading to incorrect output.
2. The condition for handling new lines and updating the `current_column` might not be accurate.
3. The logic for checking if the current line ends prematurely before reaching the desired `column` value could be faulty.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the indentation of comments. When encountering a comment in the prefix string, it fails to correctly adjust the indentation column before returning the consumed string.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling spaces and tabs to increment `current_column` correctly.
2. Ensure that the condition for handling new lines and resetting `current_column` is accurate.
3. Adjust the logic for identifying the end of indentation wait for the next line based on comment or other indentations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version, the function should now handle the prefix string correctly, consuming the required portion up to the specified column value. This fix should resolve the incorrect indentation issue observed in the failing test.
