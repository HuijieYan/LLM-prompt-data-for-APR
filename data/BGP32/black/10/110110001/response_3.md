### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. The issue lies in the logic of handling whitespace characters (`' '`, `'\t'`) and newline characters `'\n'`. The function fails to correctly indent the lines based on the provided column value, which leads to the assertion error in the test function.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation for whitespace characters and tab characters.
2. Incorrect logic when encountering newline characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function causes incorrect indentation when processing the prefix string, resulting in the failure of the assertion test. This is due to the imperfect logic in handling different types of characters and determining when to start a new line based on the provided column value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling whitespace, tab, and newline characters to correctly indent the lines according to the provided column value. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function handles different scenarios such as empty lines or unexpected characters in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now be able to correctly partially consume the prefix string based on the provided column value, resolving the indentation issue and enabling it to pass the failing test.
