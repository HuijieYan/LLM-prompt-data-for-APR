### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the input prefix based on a given column position. The function is splitting the prefix into lines based on specific characters (`' ', '\t', '\n'`) and columns. The bug is likely related to how the function handles indentation and new lines in the prefix.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is attempting to test the indentation behavior of the function by passing two different input strings with different levels of indentation. The error message indicates that the assertion is failing because the actual output of the function for `contents_tab` does not match the expected output (`contents_spc`).

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line (`'# comment'`) with different levels of indentation. The function incorrectly identifies the end of the indentation and does not handle it properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels, especially with comment lines. We should modify the logic related to tracking the column position to accommodate different indentation levels, including comment lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle different indentation levels for comment lines
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments within the `elif char == '\n':` block of the function, we can handle different levels of indentation, including comment lines. This should correct the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
