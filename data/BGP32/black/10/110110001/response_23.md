### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to handle indentation formatting. The function is checking for the presence of '\n' character to handle the newline characters properly in the input string.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the formatting of strings with different types of indentation (tabs vs spaces).
- The error message indicates a failure in comparing the expected formatted string with the actual output from the function.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles newlines and indentation levels.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not correctly handle the indentation levels in the input strings when encountering newline characters.
- The function doesn't correctly account for the indentation when there are comments after the indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation levels with newlines, spaces, tabs, and characters that are not spaces or tabs.
- Specifically, when encountering a newline character followed by content that is not spaces or tabs, we need to ensure that the function properly identifies the end of the current line and starts a new line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and current_line.strip():
            # Finish the current line and reset the indentation
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the function to correctly handle newline characters and indentation levels, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
