### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used within the codebase to handle indentation and processing of code prefixes.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function in handling comments with different indentation levels.
3. The error message indicates a specific assertion failure where the expected output does not match the actual output due to incorrect handling of comment indentation.
4. The bug seems to stem from the incorrect logic of tracking the indentation level and waiting for a newline character to determine the end of an indentation block.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug fix strategy involves properly tracking the indentation level, handling comment lines, and ensuring correct detection of newline characters to process indentation blocks accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the corrected version should now accurately handle the indentation levels and correctly process the comment lines, ensuring that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes successfully.
