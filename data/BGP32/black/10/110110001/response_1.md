### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is meant to partially consume a given prefix until a specified column is reached, while also considering special cases for spaces, tabs, and new lines.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` includes two sets of input strings for spaces and tabs indentation and expects the formatted content to match for both cases. The failing test specifically points out a discrepancy in handling comments with spaces or tabs.
3. The error message indicates that the expected formatted content does not match the actual result, leading to an `AssertionError`. The difference occurs when there is a comment line followed by indentation in the input content.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles waiting for a new line after encountering characters like spaces and tabs. It fails to handle comments in a way that aligns with the expected output.
5. To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for waiting for a new line while considering comments in the input content.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):  # Skip comments
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the function has been updated to correctly handle waiting for a new line when encountering comments. The code now skips comments when calculating indentation, which aligns with the expected behavior specified in the failing test.
