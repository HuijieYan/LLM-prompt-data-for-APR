### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is responsible for processing a given prefix string according to certain rules, specifically related to indentation.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation()` is checking if the function processes different indentation styles correctly.
- The error message indicates that the function is not handling indentation and comments properly, leading to an incorrect result.

### Bug Location:
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of characters (tabs, spaces, newlines) within the prefix string.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The function fails to correctly identify and handle the indentation of the comment line based on the whitespace characters. This leads to an incorrect output when processing the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic within the function to properly handle indentation levels and the presence of comments in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent_finish = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_indent_finish:
            if char == '\n':
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_indent_finish = False
        elif char.isspace():
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_indent_finish = True
            if char != '#':
                current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these modifications to the function, it should now correctly handle different types of characters and properly process the prefix string, addressing the indentation and commenting issues encountered in the failing test.
