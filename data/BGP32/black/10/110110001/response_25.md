### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a prefix while maintaining the correct indentation level based on the given column parameter.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix and checks for specific characters like space, tab, and newline to adjust the current column.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically tests the behavior of the function when dealing with comments and indentation in Python code.
4. The error message indicates that the function is not correctly processing the prefix, leading to an incorrect output for the given test case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of characters when encountering a newline character after a comment. When encountering a newline after a comment, the function is not resetting the `current_column` correctly, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `current_column` is reset to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle the indentation levels when processing comments and newline characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = char.isspace()
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections in the `else` block and ensuring the `current_column` is reset correctly for newline characters, the corrected function should now correctly handle comments and indentation levels, passing the failing test case.
