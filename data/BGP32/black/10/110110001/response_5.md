### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to parse and update the prefix content in a string based on the given column value.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of `_partially_consume_prefix` when handling different types of indentation and comments in Python code.
3. The error message highlights an assertion failure due to mismatched expected and actual outputs of `fs(contents_tab)` compared to `contents_spc`.
4. Potential error locations in the buggy function are related to how whitespaces, tabs, and newlines are handled during prefix parsing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of newlines when reaching the end of an indented block. The function fails to properly adjust the column count when encountering a newline after an indentation level, resulting in misaligned prefixes.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column count is correctly updated when encountering a newline character after indentation. Additionally, we should handle the case where the last line does not end with a newline character to process the final line correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `wait_for_nl` condition and resetting the `current_column` appropriately, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation and prefix parsing correctly, passing the failing test.
