### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not properly handling the indentation within the prefix string, leading to incorrect output.
2. The function is responsible for consuming characters from the `prefix` string until a specific column is reached, considering indentation with spaces and tabs.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` is highlighting the issue with handling indentation and newline characters.
4. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the function.
5. The bug is likely related to incorrect handling of indentation characters (' ' and '\t') and newline characters ('\n') within the prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not properly handle indentations and newlines, which results in incorrect partial consumption of the prefix string. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual output when testing code with indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to correctly handle indentation with spaces and tabs, incrementing the `current_column` accordingly.
2. Properly reset `current_column` when encountering a newline character to handle line breaks correctly.
3. Ensure that the function consumes the correct portion of the prefix string based on the given column value and indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            if current_column >= column:
                break
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```
