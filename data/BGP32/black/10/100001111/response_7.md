The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect handling of indentation levels when processing prefixes containing tabs and spaces. The issue stems from the logic that determines when to wait for a newline after encountering a non-whitespace character.

The bug occurs because when encountering a non-whitespace character, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` to indicate the start of a new line. However, in the case where the input prefix includes tabs, the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` value and sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`. This causes the function to misinterpret when to wait for a newline, leading to incorrect line separation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` based on the presence of different whitespace characters such as tabs and spaces. Additionally, we should update the `current_column` value correctly to align with the actual column position in the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes adjusting the `current_column` value properly for tabs and spaces, ensuring that the function correctly handles indentation levels and waits for new lines at the appropriate positions.

By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function with these modifications, the bug causing incorrect indentation handling should be resolved, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub problem related to tabulated comments after a dedent.
