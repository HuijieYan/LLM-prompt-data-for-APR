### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a specific part of the input `prefix` based on indentation rules. However, the function has a bug that causes incorrect handling of tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect indentation behavior.

The main issue lies in the calculation of the `current_column` within the function. When encountering a tab character (`\t`), the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by just `4`. This leads to incorrect representation of the actual indentation level caused by tabs.

Additionally, the function does not handle consecutive tabs correctly, leading to further inaccuracies in determining the column positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we need to adjust the calculation of the `current_column` to properly handle both tab characters and spaces. Each tab character should contribute the equivalent of 4 spaces to the column count. Additionally, we need to handle consecutive tabs correctly to ensure accurate column tracking.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_column = (current_column // 4) * 4  # Handle tabs correctly
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the handling of tab characters (`\t`) to contribute the equivalent of 4 spaces to the `current_column`.
2. Added a correction step to handle consecutive tabs accurately by aligning the column to the last multiple of 4.
3. Kept track of the column position and indentation level accurately to ensure proper handling of indentation rules.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now correctly consume the prefix as intended, addressing the buggy behavior observed in the failing tests and resolving the indentation issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
