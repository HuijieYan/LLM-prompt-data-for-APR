### Analysis and Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles indentation in the input `prefix`. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not consistently updated, leading to incorrect handling of newlines and indentation.

1. In Case 1, the function fails to handle indentation properly when encountering a newline character. The expected output should preserve the comment's leading whitespace.
2. In Case 3, the function does not handle tabs correctly, leading to incorrect indentation.
3. In Case 5, the function fails to maintain the expected indentation levels when encountering spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, focus on properly updating the `wait_for_nl` flag when checking for different indentation characters. Ensure that the function can handle both spaces and tabs correctly while preserving the intended indentations of comments within the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines = []
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures proper handling of different whitespace characters and correctly maintains the expected indentation levels for comments within the prefix.
