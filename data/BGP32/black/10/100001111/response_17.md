### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a specific prefix string up to a given column value. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of newline characters and whitespace when matching the column value. The function is not accurately considering the indentation level while consuming the prefix string.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function fails to return the expected output because it does not handle the newline character correctly when checking the indentation level against the specified column.
2. In Case 3 and Case 5, the function fails to correctly manage the tab characters' indentation level, leading to incorrect outputs.
3. In Case 6, the function incorrectly consumes the prefix string leading to an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately handle different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) and correctly compare the indentation level against the specified column value. Additionally, considering edge cases like empty strings would be necessary.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False

        if wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    if current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

After applying this correction, the function should consume the prefix string accurately based on the specified column value, taking into account different types of indentation characters. The corrected version should now satisfy all the test cases and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
