The issue seems to be related to indentation errors when handling comments with tabs in the code. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly maintaining the indentation when processing the prefix.

The main issue here lies in the handling of tabs and indentation levels within the function. The function is not properly accounting for the tab character when calculating the current column position. This can lead to incorrect indentation levels and misalignment of comments.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to handle tabs correctly and accurately update the current column position based on tabs encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust indentation for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version now properly accounts for tab characters in the input prefix and adjusts the current column position accordingly. It should address the issue described in the GitHub report and maintain the correct indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs in the codebase.
