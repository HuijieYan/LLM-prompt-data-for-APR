The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of tab characters for indentation. The function does not correctly track the indentation level when encountering tabs.

The bug can be attributed to the fact that the function increments the `current_column` variable by a fixed value of 4 when encountering a tab character (`'\t'`). However, the expected behavior should be to align the indentation level to the next multiple of 4.

To fix this bug, a strategy would involve adjusting the way the `current_column` variable is updated when encountering tab characters. Instead of incrementing by a fixed value, we should align the `current_column` to the next multiple of 4.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 4) // 4 * 4  # Align to the next multiple of 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fixed version of the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels when encountering tab characters, aligning them to the next multiple of 4 as expected.
