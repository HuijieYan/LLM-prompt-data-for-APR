The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to the handling of indentation and newline characters. The function is intended to parse a string `prefix` and separate it into two parts: one that has indentation less than a given `column` and the remaining part.

The function incorrectly handles the scenarios where there is a tab character (`\t`) present in the prefix string. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, which is incorrect, as tabs should typically be considered as advancing to the next multiple of 8 columns.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the way tab characters are processed and correctly calculate the indentation level. Additionally, we need to ensure that the current line and column are maintained correctly throughout the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8  # Advance to the next multiple of 8 columns
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of tab characters and calculates the correct indentation level based on tabs.

By applying this correction, the function now correctly processes the indentation and newline characters, addressing the issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
