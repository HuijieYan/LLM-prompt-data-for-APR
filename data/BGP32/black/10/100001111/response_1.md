## Bug Fix

### Issue:
The bug is occurring when the function encounters a newline character within the prefix input. The logic to handle the newline character and adjust the current column and wait for the newline is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the newline character when updating the current column and tracking if the function should wait for the next newline. This faulty logic disrupts the indentation process and causes the function to return incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling newline characters to correctly reset the current column and wait for the newline flag.
2. Ensure that the indentation tracking and newline handling are aligned to accurately process the prefix input.

### Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                if current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += '\n'
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated version addresses the issues with the newline character handling and ensures that the current column and wait for the newline flag are updated correctly, allowing the function to process prefix inputs accurately.
