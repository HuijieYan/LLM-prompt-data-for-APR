### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a specific column while correctly handling tabs, spaces, and newline characters. The issue arises when dealing with tab characters, leading to incorrect column counting and, consequently, erroneous handling of the prefix.

### Identified Potential Error:
1. Inconsistent handling of tab characters causing incorrect column counting.
2. Incorrect reset of `current_column` and `current_line` when encountering tab characters.
3. Inadequate logic for checking the validity of the consumed line with the desired column.
4. Failure to correctly return the remaining prefix after consuming up to the specified column.

### Bug Cause:
1. When encountering a tab character `'\t'`, the bug adds `4` to `current_column`, leading to incorrect column tracking. This behavior does not align with the actual column position in the prefix string, especially for consecutive tab characters.
2. The function fails to reset `current_column` and `current_line` when a tab character appears, resulting in misalignment between the current state and the actual prefix position.
3. The logic for validating the consumed line's column count is insufficient, as it only checks against the specified `column`, disregarding tab characters' contribution to the column count.
4. Upon finding a valid line within the specified column, the function erroneously interprets the remaining prefix to capture all characters beyond the processed line.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `elif char == '\t':` section to adjust the `current_column` based on the number of spaces a tab represents.
2. Ensure proper resetting of `current_column` and `current_line` when encountering tab characters to maintain accurate tracking of the column position.
3. Enhance the validation logic to consider tab characters in determining the actual column count for a line.
4. Modify the returning logic to correctly capture the remaining prefix after consuming up to the desired column.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust current_column for tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char != '\n' else 0  # Update current_column considering newline
            
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted the check for column
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line 
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By integrating these corrections, the updated function should now accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column, handle tab characters appropriately, and provide the desired remaining prefix after processing. This revised version aims to resolve the identified issues and align with the expected input/output values while addressing the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation handling for tabulated comments.
