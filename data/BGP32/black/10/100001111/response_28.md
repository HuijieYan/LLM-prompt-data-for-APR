### Anaylsis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a part of the input prefix based on indentation rules.
2. The bug likely occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters when determining the indentation level.
3. The function should correctly track the number of spaces corresponding to a tab character to maintain accurate indentation.
4. Current implementation fails to correctly process tab characters, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic handling tab characters to track and convert them to equivalent spaces.
2. Adjust the indentation calculation to account for both spaces and tab characters correctly.
3. Ensure that the function accurately determines the correct indentation level while consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_size = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the remaining spaces to the next tab stop
            current_line += ' ' * tab_size  # Convert tab to equivalent spaces
            current_column += tab_size
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version updates the logic for handling tab characters by converting them to the appropriate number of spaces to maintain consistent indentation. Additionally, adjustments to character counting ensure accurate tracking of the current column position during prefix consumption.
