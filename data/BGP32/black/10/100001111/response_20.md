The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the given `column` value. However, it fails to handle proper indentations when encountering tabs or multiple spaces. The issue arises when a new line is processed after a certain column limit, affecting the indentation level for subsequent lines.

The identified bug in the function is the incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`) in updating the `current_column` count. The function mistakenly assumes that each tab character contributes only `1` unit to the column count, instead of `4`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for updating `current_column` when encountering tab characters. We should increment `current_column` by `4` instead of `1` for each tab character encountered. This change will align the column count correctly with the standard tab spacing.

Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle tab characters while updating the column count, resolving the indentation issue as reported in the GitHub issue.
