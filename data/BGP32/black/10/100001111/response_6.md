### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, considering a counting system that includes spaces and tabs. It reads characters from the prefix, updating the current line, current column, and wait_for_nl status accordingly.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of newline characters when determining the current indentation level.
- In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the comment line's indentation due to the way newline characters are processed.
- In Case 2, the function should return an empty string as the remaining prefix, but in the buggy version, it fails to do so.
- In Case 3, the function incorrectly includes the newline character in the last line.
- The bug seems to be related to the logic in the `elif char == '\n'` and `else` branches, where resetting the current_column and waiting for a newline might cause issues.

### Bug Cause:
- The issue arises because the logic for handling indentation when encountering newline characters is incorrect. It fails to reset the current_column appropriately and might capture unwanted characters as part of the current line.
- Additionally, the logic for transitioning from indentation to waiting for a newline is flawed, leading to incorrect capturing of the lines.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the current_column is correctly updated when encountering newline characters.
2. Adjust the transition from indentation to waiting for a newline based on the current character and indentation status.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Now the corrected function should properly handle the cases mentioned and effectively consume the prefix until the desired column is reached, without introducing unwanted characters or indented lines.
