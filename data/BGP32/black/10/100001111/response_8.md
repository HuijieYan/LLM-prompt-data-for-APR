### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle partial token consumption based on indentation levels in the prefix text. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior, as reported in the GitHub issue. The main problem arises when dealing with tabs and spaces for indentation.

### Identified Issues:
1. When encountering a tab character (`'\t'`), the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4, instead of handling tabs as a single character for column calculation.
2. The function does not consider the correct indentation level when skipping spaces after detecting the end of an indent.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters for indentation level calculation. The inconsistent treatment of tabs leads to improper column tracking and indent resolution, resulting in incorrect formatting as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are counted as a single unit for column tracking. Additionally, we should properly handle the indentation level when encountering spaces after an indent is completed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Treat tab as 1 unit for indentation
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n' or char == '\t':
            # Skip extra spaces and tabs after indentation
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Additional Notes:
The corrected version of the function ensures that tab characters are counted accurately for indentation level calculation and properly handles spacing and tabulation after an indent. This should address the reported issue on GitHub and maintain consistent formatting for tabulated comments after a dedent.
