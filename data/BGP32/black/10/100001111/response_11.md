The bug in the provided `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces while calculating the current column position. It results in incorrect indentations when there are tab characters in the input prefix string.

The issue can be resolved by correctly updating the `current_column` based on the tab length and spaces. Additionally, adjustments need to be made in the comparison logic to ensure proper handling of tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_size = 4
            current_column += tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correct tab calculations and adjusting the char comparisons, this corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub post while handling tabs and spaces appropriately for maintaining the indentation levels.
