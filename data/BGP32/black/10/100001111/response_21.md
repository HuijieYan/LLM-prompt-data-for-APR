### Identified Issue:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the detection of line breaks and adjusting the column count accordingly. This issue leads to incorrect indentation, especially with tab characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function fails to correctly handle the tab character ('\t') when calculating the current column position.
2. The logic for detecting line breaks and adjusting the current column and line information is not consistent, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly calculate the column position.
2. Ensure that line breaks are handled consistently to maintain proper indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrected logic for handling tab characters and ensuring proper line break detection, the function should now output the expected content with the correct indentation. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation with tab characters after a dedent.
