### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of the input `prefix` based on the given `column`. The function is expected to handle spaces, tabs, and newlines correctly to determine the consumed prefix. However, there are issues with handling tabs and newlines, impacting the correct calculation of `current_column` and further processing of the input.

### Error Location:
The errors are primarily present in the handling of tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). The function does not consider the correct tab size while updating the `current_column`. Similarly, it does not handle newlines appropriately to reset the column count.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 1, for the input `'    # comment\n    '`, the function fails to correctly calculate the `current_column` when encountering a tab character `\t`. This leads to an incorrect assessment of the consumed prefix.
2. In Case 3, the function incorrectly handles the newline character `\n`, not properly resetting the `current_column`.
3. In Case 5, again, a similar issue with tabs leads to incorrect behavior in determining the consumed prefix.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the issues with tabs and newlines, the function should appropriately handle tabs by considering their equivalent space count and reset the column count when encountering a newline. By addressing these issues, the function can accurately determine the consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # setting tab size to 4 as example
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            pass
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version incorporates correct handling of tabs and newlines to ensure accurate calculation of the consumed prefix based on the specified column.
