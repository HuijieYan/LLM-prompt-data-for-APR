### Potential Error Location
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the logic related to updating the current column when encountering certain characters like tabs, spaces, and newlines. The issue is likely in the logic of updating `current_column` based on the character read from the `prefix`. The condition for updating `current_column` based on tabs might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
- The buggy function fails to properly update the `current_column` when encountering tab characters. This failure leads to incorrect column calculations and returning incorrect results.
- The logic of handling tab characters and incrementing `current_column` by 4 units is causing the incorrect behavior, especially when tabs are mixed with spaces in the input prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters. We should consider the mixture of tabs and spaces and ensure the correct indentation calculation regardless of the character encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust the column for tabs position
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column on encountering newline
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += len(char)

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the update for `current_column` when encountering tab characters, this corrected version should resolve the bug and meet the expected input/output values for all tested cases. It ensures proper handling of tabs and spaces to maintain the correct column calculation during the prefix consumption.
