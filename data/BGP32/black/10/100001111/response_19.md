### Bug Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a given prefix string, consume indentation characters (spaces, tabs) until reaching a newline character. It aims to extract lines based on the indentation level to adjust the code formatting properly. However, the function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in certain cases where tabs are involved.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Cases 1 and 3, the function fails to adjust the `current_column` value correctly when encountering tab characters. Tabs are considered as a single character in Python but should represent a different amount of indentation than a space character, which results in inconsistencies when calculating the indentation level.
2. In Case 5, the function incorrectly processes the prefix containing tab characters, leading to discrepancies in the returned lines' content due to mismanaging tab indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, the function must accurately handle tab characters' indentation levels by interpreting tabs as multiples of spaces (e.g., 4 spaces per tab). By adjusting the `current_column` calculation based on the encountered characters, we can ensure consistent indentation processing for both spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Modify the way tab characters' indentation levels are calculated
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the calculation for tab characters' indentation within the function, the corrected version should now accurately process prefixes containing tabs and spaces to maintain correct line indentation levels, addressing the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue related to tabulated comments' indentation.
