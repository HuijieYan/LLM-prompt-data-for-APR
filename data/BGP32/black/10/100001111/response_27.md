## Bug Fix Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to have a bug related to handling tab characters while tracking column position. It is expected to correctly consume indentation levels in the prefix and return the consumed lines along with the remaining prefix. The bug arises when dealing with tab characters and indentations greater than 1.

- In Case 1, the function incorrectly processes the tab character '\t' leading to an incorrect calculation of the current column.
- In Case 3, the tab character '\t' does not increment the current_column correctly, affecting the indent tracking.
- The bug seems to originate from handling tab characters differently than spaces, leading to incorrect calculations of the current column position.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we need to ensure that tab characters are processed correctly to track the column position accurately. 
Here is the strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic related to tab character '\t' to correctly adjust the current_column.
2. Adjust the logic for detecting a change in indentation levels while processing the prefix.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_spacing = 4  # Customize as needed
            current_column += tab_spacing - (current_column % tab_spacing)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab characters, specifically in adjusting the `current_column` variable, we allow for correct tracking of the column position during indentation processing. This revised function should now accurately consume the prefix with correct indentation, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
