### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function aims to process a given prefix text to adjust the indentation levels based on tabs and spaces. It encounters issues related to handling newline characters and tab indentation, leading to incorrect indentation adjustments in certain scenarios.

### Error Locations:
1. Inconsistent handling of `wait_for_nl` flag to identify the end of an indentation block.
2. Incorrect calculation of `current_column` for tab characters.
3. Missing logic to reset the indentation level after encountering a newline character.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the function not correctly resetting the `current_column` value when encountering a newline character, leading to maintaining an incorrect indentation level for subsequent lines. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a newline character to end an indentation block (`wait_for_nl`) is not properly managed, causing issues with indentation recognition.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for resetting the `current_column` value when encountering a newline character to ensure correct indentation tracking.
2. Properly manage the `wait_for_nl` flag to determine the end of an indentation block and reset the indentation level accordingly.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the indentation issues by ensuring the `current_column` is correctly reset after encountering newline characters and managing the `wait_for_nl` flag to indicate the end of an indentation block. It should now handle the provided test cases and align with the expected input/output values while resolving the GitHub issue related to tabulated comments indentation.
