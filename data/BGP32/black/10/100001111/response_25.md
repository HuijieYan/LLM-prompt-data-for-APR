The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition checks related to indentations and line breaks. Specifically, when encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4, leading to incorrect calculations for checking the column alignment. Additionally, the logic for handling '\n' characters is flawed, leading to unexpected behavior when encountering new lines.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made:
1. Update the logic for incrementing `current_column` based on tab characters to align with the expected indentation behavior.
2. Revise the logic for handling '\n' characters to reset the `current_column` to 0 correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Update the tab calculation to align with standard behavior
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add current_line before resetting
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the indentation and line break handling issues, aligning with the expected behavior provided in the GitHub issue.
