### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process indentation levels, handle tabs and spaces, and recognize newline characters to return the consumed prefix correctly. The issue arises when handling tab characters and the indentation level when a newline is encountered. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent when tabs are used in the input.

### Error Locations:
1. In the `elif char == '\t':` block, the `current_column` is incremented by 4, which may not align with the expected indentation level.
2. The logic within the `if char == '\n':` block does not handle the correct indentation level reset for comments after dedent.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect indentation handling involving tab characters in the input prefix. The function fails to accurately track the indentation columns during tab processing and reset the correct column for subsequent lines, leading to incorrect indentation levels for comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the handling of tab characters to align the `current_column` correctly with the expected indentation level. Additionally, ensure that the indentation level is reset appropriately for comments following a dedent operation.

### Bug-Fixed Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the number of spaces instead of incrementing by 4
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # Update the current_column to 0 before handling newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The updated function adjusts the handling of tab characters to increment `current_column` based on the spaces required to align with the next tab stop. Additionally, it ensures that the `current_column` is appropriately reset to 0 when encountering newline characters, correcting the indentation levels for comments. This modification resolves the issue reported in the GitHub problem related to tab indentation inconsistencies.
