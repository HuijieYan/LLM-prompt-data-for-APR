### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix until a certain column depth is reached. However, the function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments.

### Issues:
1. When encountering a tab character, the function increments the `current_column` by 4, which is not consistent with Python's tab spacing rule of 8 characters. This inconsistency affects the comparison with the `column` value.
2. The logic to handle tab characters and space characters should be aligned to ensure correct indentation tracking.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is primarily related to the improper handling of tab characters, resulting in incorrect updates to the `current_column` value. This issue leads to incorrect comparisons and decisions within the loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the handling of tab characters to increment the `current_column` value by 8 for each encountered tab character.
2. Ensure consistency in handling tab characters and space characters to maintain correct indentation tracking.
3. Revise the logic related to waiting for a new line after indentation is finished to correctly handle tabulated comments.

### Updated Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Increment by 8 to match Python tab width
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, we address the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces, ensuring that the behavior aligns with Python's syntax rules. This corrected version should resolve the indentation issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior for the given test cases.
