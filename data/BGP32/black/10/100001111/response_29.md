### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming the prefix string up to a certain column number, respecting indentation and newline characters. The bug seems to occur when processing tab characters and calculating the current column number, leading to incorrect line splitting.

### Error Locations
1. The calculation of `current_column` for tab characters, incrementing by 4 instead of taking into account the existing indentation level.
2. Inconsistent handling of indenation levels and newline characters when tab characters are present.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect calculation of `current_column` for tab characters in the prefix string. It leads to misalignment in line splitting and results in incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the calculation of `current_column` for tab characters based on the existing indentation level.
2. Ensure consistent handling of indentation levels and newline characters for proper line splitting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Adjust increment for tabs based on existing indentation
            while current_column % 4 != 0:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tab characters to align with the existing indentation level. It ensures proper line splitting and maintains consistency in handling indentation levels and newline characters.
