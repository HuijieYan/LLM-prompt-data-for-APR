### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to take a prefix string and partially process it to extract lines based on specific conditions like indentation levels. The function's logic to handle indentation and newline characters seems to be causing the bug, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Error Location:
The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the identification of newlines and indentation levels, especially when encountering tab characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When encountering a `\t` character in the input prefix, the function increments `current_column` by 4, which is incorrect.
2. The logic to handle tab characters and updating `current_column` and `current_line` seems flawed, leading to misinterpretation of indentation levels and newline characters.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the handling of tab characters to correctly account for the indentation level.
2. Ensure that the `current_column` and `current_line` are appropriately updated based on tab characters.
3. Modify conditions related to newline characters to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust handling of tab character
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust handling of newline character
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Reset wait for newline flag
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and provide the expected output for the test cases provided. It ensures proper handling of tab characters and updates the `current_column` and `current_line` variables appropriately.
