### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix until a specific column is reached. However, the logic within the function has a bug that causes incorrect handling of indentation levels when tabs are involved. The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the buggy function's behavior. 

### Bug Explanation:
1. In cases where the prefix contains tabs, the `current_column` variable increments incorrectly, causing misalignment with the actual column position.
2. The logic to handle tabs (`\t`) causes incorrect updates to the `current_column` variable, impacting the expected output when consuming the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the handling of tabs when calculating the `current_column` value.
2. Validate the conditions for updating the `current_column` correctly to maintain proper indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to handling tabs and updates the `current_column` variable correctly to maintain the expected indentation levels.
