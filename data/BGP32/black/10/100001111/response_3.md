The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where it checks for a newline character (`char == '\n'`). This condition is supposed to handle when the function encounters a new line in the prefix string and needs to reset certain variables, but the current implementation has a logic flaw.

The bug occurs when the function is waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl` is True), and upon encountering a new line character, it incorrectly appends the current line to the `lines` list without considering the indentation level.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the current line is only appended to `lines` if it is not empty and if its column level is less than the specified `column`. Additionally, we need to reset the `current_line` and `current_column` values after appending the line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that only complete lines with indentation less than the specified `column` are appended to the `lines` list. The logic for handling new lines and resetting variables has been adjusted to correctly handle the indentation levels. This fix should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
