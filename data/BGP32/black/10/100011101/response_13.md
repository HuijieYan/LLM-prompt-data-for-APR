### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to how the indentation levels are being handled. The function is incorrectly checking for the column position before consuming the complete line. This leads to incorrect handling of lines with comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the complete line is consumed before checking the indentation level. This can be achieved by moving the check for the column position after the line is fully processed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By using this corrected version of the function, the buggy behavior should be resolved, and the function should meet the expected input/output values for the provided test cases.
