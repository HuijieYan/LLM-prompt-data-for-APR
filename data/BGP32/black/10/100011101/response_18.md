### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specific column limit, considering newlines, spaces, and tabs for indentation. The bug originates from the incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering a comment. Specifically, the function fails to correctly calculate the column index when encountering a comment since it does not increment the `current_column` variable for characters within the comment.

When a comment is encountered, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, expecting a newline to indicate the end of the comment or indentation. However, it fails to account for the characters within the comment contributing to the column count. As a result, when a comment is present, the comparison of `current_column < column` does not accurately reflect the intended column index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable increments correctly when processing characters within a comment. This can be achieved by adding the necessary increments for the characters in the comment block (excluding newline characters). The `current_column` should account for each character, including spaces and tabs within the comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # handle comment correctly
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column += len(prefix) - prefix.rfind('\n') - 1
        else:
            # correctly handle indentation
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correction to increment `current_column` based on the characters within the comment, the function should now correctly handle comments and accurately calculate the column index, addressing the bug identified in the original implementation.
