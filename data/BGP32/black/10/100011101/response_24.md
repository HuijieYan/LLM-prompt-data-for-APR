The cause of the bug in the provided function is that it doesn't handle the case where `wait_for_nl` is True and the current character is not a newline character. This leads to the premature return of partially consumed prefix contents.

The strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that when `wait_for_nl` is True, the function continues iterating through the prefix until it finds a newline character, accounting for spaces, tabs, and other characters in between.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles waiting for a newline character when `wait_for_nl` is True, ensuring the correct consumption of the prefix contents.
