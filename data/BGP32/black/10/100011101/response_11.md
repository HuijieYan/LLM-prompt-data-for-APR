### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue in handling the indentation level for empty lines. When encountering an empty line, the current_column should be reset to 0, but instead, it is not being reset, causing incorrect indentation behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when encountering an empty line (`char == '\n'`), the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The correction ensures that the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0 when encountering an empty line. This adjustment should address the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test case.
