### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to the logic in the `if-elif-else` block in the loop. When encountering a '\n' character, the current_column is set to 0 prematurely, even if the line is not empty. This causes the subsequent lines to get misaligned in terms of column count. The premature reset of the current_column leads to incorrect indentation detection.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current_column is only reset to 0 when encountering an empty line after checking the current line's content and the expected column position. This adjustment will prevent misalignments in subsequent lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res) :]

                if current_line.strip() == '':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() == '':
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected version addresses the bug by adjusting the conditions for resetting the current_column and appending lines. This revised logic ensures that the current_column is only reset when encountering an empty line after evaluating the current line's content and expected column position.
