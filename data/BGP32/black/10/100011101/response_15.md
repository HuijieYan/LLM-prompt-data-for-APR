### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` cannot correctly handle situations where the indentation level is less than the specified `column` parameter. This leads to incorrect behavior when attempting to consume characters until reaching the specified column. As a result, the function fails to properly consume the prefix and return the expected result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes characters according to the specified `column` parameter while handling various indentation levels. We should consider adjusting the logic related to counting columns and waiting for newlines to effectively consume the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char in ['\n', '\r']:  # Check for line breaks
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Consider tab as 4 spaces
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above changes, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the provided `column` parameter and handle various indentation levels. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and behave as expected.
