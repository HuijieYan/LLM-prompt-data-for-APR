### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering a comment line. The function incorrectly checks whether the current column is less than the specified column and assumes that indentations are finished when encountering a comment. This leads to issues with aligning comments properly in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels even when encountering comment lines. We should adjust how column comparisons are made and reset the current column appropriately when encountering a new line.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
            
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

        if current_column >= column:
            wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected function, it should now properly handle the indentation levels and comments to align the output correctly. This revised version should pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
