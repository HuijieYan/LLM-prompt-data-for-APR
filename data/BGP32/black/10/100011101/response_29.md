### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of comments when determining the column position. When encountering a comment within the `prefix`, the function incorrectly includes the space characters before the comment as part of the comment, causing the calculation of the column position to be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering comments, only the comment itself is added to the `lines` list, and any leading spaces before the comment are stripped. This will correctly calculate the column position for the comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                comment_index = current_line.find('#')
                if comment_index != -1:
                    current_line = current_line[:comment_index] + '\n'
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of comments within the prefix, the function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
