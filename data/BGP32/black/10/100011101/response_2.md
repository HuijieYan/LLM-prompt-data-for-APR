### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition when `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` and a newline character `'\n'` is encountered. In this case, the function should check if `current_column` is less than `column` before returning the result. However, the implementation is incorrect as it doesn't consider the case where the current line is empty (only containing whitespace characters) before encountering the newline character.

### Bug Explanation:
In Case 1, the bug triggers when it encounters a newline character `'\n'` while `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is not sufficient as it doesn't handle the case where `current_line` only contains whitespace characters. This leads to part of the prefix not being consumed correctly, causing the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the prefix should be consumed. We should include a check to ensure that `current_line` contains at least one non-whitespace character before considering it for consumption.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and handle cases where the current line consists only of whitespace characters before the newline character. This should resolve the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
