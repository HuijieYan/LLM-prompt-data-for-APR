### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the condition where the indentation level is being determined. The function incorrectly identifies the end of indentation by waiting for a newline character immediately after a non-whitespace character. This approach fails to account for scenarios where comments are present alongside the code within the same line causing the indentation level to be misinterpreted.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle cases where comments are present on the same line as code. Instead of waiting for a newline character after encountering a non-whitespace character, we need to check for the occurrence of a comment indicator ('#') to properly identify the end of an indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            # Check for a comment indicator to properly end the current indentation level
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Start waiting for a newline or comment indicator to end the current indentation
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the check for a comment indicator ('#') as a criterion for ending the current indentation level, this corrected version of the function should now handle cases where comments are present alongside code correctly, resolving the bug.
