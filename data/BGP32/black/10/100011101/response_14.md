### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:`. This condition is checking if the current line contains any non-whitespace characters and if the current column is less than the specified column. However, this condition is incorrect in handling the indentation behavior related to comments.

The condition should be checking if the current column is greater or equal to the specified column, as the function aims to consume prefix text up to a particular column. This incorrect condition leads to the bug where the function does not consume the full prefix text before the specified column when encountering a comment in the prefix text.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition inside the for loop to compare `current_column` with `column` appropriately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By correcting the condition to check if `current_column >= column`, the function will now properly consume the prefix text up to the specified column, including handling comments correctly.
