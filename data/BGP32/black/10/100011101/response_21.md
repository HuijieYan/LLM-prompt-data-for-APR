### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the last line in the prefix does not end with a newline character. This causes the function to incorrectly process the indentation level and misses appending the last line to the `lines` list. As a result, the expected output does not match the actual output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the last line in the prefix is properly processed and appended to the `lines` list even if it doesn't end with a newline character. Additionally, we need to reset `current_line` and `current_column` correctly when processing the next line.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making sure to append the last line in the prefix if needed and properly resetting the variables for the next line, the corrected function should now handle the indentation processing correctly and pass the failing test cases.
