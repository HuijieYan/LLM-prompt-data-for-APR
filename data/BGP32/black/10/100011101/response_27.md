### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles the case when encountering a newline character (`\n`). The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to `0` when it should actually reset it to the last seen indentation level. This incorrect behavior results in misalignments when consuming the prefix text.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the last seen indentation level and reset the `current_column` to that level when encountering a newline character. This way, we can ensure that the alignment is maintained correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    last_indentation = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = last_indentation
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            last_indentation = current_column
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function accurately tracks the last seen indentation level (`last_indentation`) and resets `current_column` to this level when encountering a newline character. This approach ensures that the alignment is consistent and correct.
