## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level when encountering a comment in the prefix. It incorrectly increments the `current_column` when encountering a comment, resulting in an inconsistent indentation level that causes the assertion error in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle comments in the prefix string and adjust the calculation of the `current_column` accordingly. We should not count the spaces or tabs inside the comment towards the indentation level.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Adjusted to count only one column for any space or tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment in the function, it should now handle comments correctly and pass the failing test cases.
