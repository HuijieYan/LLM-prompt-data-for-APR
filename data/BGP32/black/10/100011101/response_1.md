### Bug in the Buggy Function
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle scenarios where the comment lines begin with a space or tab character within the given prefix string. The function incorrectly keeps a space or tab character before the comment as part of the previous line's content, causing mismatches in column positions and resulting in incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to correctly handle situations where comments start with spaces or tabs. We should separate the comments from whitespace characters and ensure that the indentations are preserved accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '#':  # Start processing comments separately
            current_line += char
            continue
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By separating the comments from whitespace characters and properly tracking the column positions, the corrected function should now handle scenarios with comment lines that start with spaces or tabs correctly. This correction should enable the function to pass the failing tests and produce the expected output.
