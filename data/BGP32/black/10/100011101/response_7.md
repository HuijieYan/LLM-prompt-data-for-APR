### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to the handling of indentation levels and newlines. When encountering a character, the function checks for spaces, tabs, and newlines to update the current column number and determine if the indent is finished. However, the logic for handling indentation levels and waiting for a newline seems to be incorrect, resulting in mismatched behavior when consuming the prefix.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the condition blocks for handling spaces, tabs, and newlines. In particular, the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` and handling the newline character should be reevaluated.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for updating the `current_column` variable based on different characters (spaces, tabs).
2. Revise the condition for setting `wait_for_nl` to accurately represent when the indent is finished.
3. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    # handle the final line without a trailing newline
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After updating the function with the corrected logic, it should now handle the prefix input correctly based on the defined rules, resolving the issue observed in the failing test case.
