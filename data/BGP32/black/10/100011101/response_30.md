### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the case where the function is waiting for a new line character to finish indentation but encounters a space character instead. When this happens, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`, expecting the next character to be a new line to complete the indentation level. This leads to the discrepancy in handling comments and indentation levels, as seen in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic when encountering a space character while waiting for a new line. Instead of setting `wait_for_nl` to `True`, we should handle the space character to increment the current column properly.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the condition for handling spaces, the corrected function should now properly process indentation, including comments, and handle the waiting for a new line character appropriately. This adjustment aligns the function's behavior with the expected handling of indentation levels and comments.
