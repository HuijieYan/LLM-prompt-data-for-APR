The issue in the buggy function is that it does not handle the scenario where the indentation ends before encountering a new line character. This leads to inaccuracy in determining the correct prefix to be consumed.

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume an input string `prefix` based on a given `column` value. It iterates through each character in the prefix and builds lines until a newline character is found. However, when the indentation ends without moving to a new line, the function fails to correctly return the consumed prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the function to handle the case where the indentation ends without encountering a new line character. One way to address this is by checking if `current_column` is less than the desired `column` before declaring a new line.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle cases where the indentation ends without encountering a new line character, ensuring that the consumed prefix is accurately determined.
