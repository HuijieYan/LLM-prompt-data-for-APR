### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic handling newline characters. When encountering a newline character, the current column is reset to 0 before checking the indent level against the specified column. This reset leads to incorrect column comparisons causing indentation errors in the returned prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic during newline character processing. Instead of resetting the current column to 0 immediately, we should first compare the current column with the specified column before resetting it to 0 if necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By rearranging the logic related to newline character handling and column comparison, the corrected function should now properly handle indentation and return the correct prefix based on the specified column.
