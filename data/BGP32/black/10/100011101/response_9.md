### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles the indentation of comments. When the function encounters a comment starting with `#`, it waits for a new line character (`\n`) to determine the end of the comment and indentation level. However, if there is no newline character after the comment, it fails to correctly detect the end of the comment and includes the indentation level in the comment itself, causing the assertion error in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered, the function correctly identifies the end of the comment, even if there is no following newline character. This can be achieved by modifying the logic that determines when a comment ends and properly handling the indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if '#' in current_line:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes an additional condition to check if a comment is present in the current line when a newline character is encountered. If a comment is present, it sets the `wait_for_nl` flag to `True` to correctly handle the end of the comment and the indentation level. This modification ensures that comments are properly identified and handled within the function.
