### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation levels when consuming a prefix string. The function incorrectly determines the remaining prefix after partially consuming it based on the specified column. This leads to incorrect behavior when processing multiline prefixes with comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for determining when to check for hitting the specified column and when to wait for a newline character.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles comments and indentation levels within the prefix string.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After applying the corrections, the function should now properly handle prefixes with comments and maintain the correct indentation level based on the specified column.
