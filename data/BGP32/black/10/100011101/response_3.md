The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of whitespace characters and comments. When the function encounters a newline character followed by a comment within the prefix string, it fails to maintain indentation correctly, resulting in the comment being misplaced in the returned output.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles newline characters followed by comments, ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line = char  # Continue the newline in current_line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    # Append remaining current_line if any
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that correct indentation is maintained for comments following newline characters. This should resolve the issue with misplaced comments in the output.
