### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` and the current character is a newline character, instead of checking if the current line's length is less than the provided column for indentation, the code immediately appends the current line to the `lines` list without evaluating the indentation level. This behavior causes misalignment issues in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character while `wait_for_nl` is `True`, we should only append the current line to the `lines` list if the indentation level (`current_column`) satisfies the provided column for indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Check indentation level
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making sure to check the indentation level before appending the line when encountering a newline character while `wait_for_nl` is `True`, the corrected function should now align the lines properly according to the provided column for indentation.
