### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic where the function does not correctly handle the case when encountering a newline character (`\n`) while waiting for a newline. This causes the function to improperly process the indentation levels of the prefix, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl` flag set), the function correctly resets the current line and column count and includes the line in the result if the indentation level is less than the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` variables when encountering a newline while waiting for a newline, the corrected version of the function ensures that the indentation levels are processed accurately, addressing the bug observed in the failing test cases.
