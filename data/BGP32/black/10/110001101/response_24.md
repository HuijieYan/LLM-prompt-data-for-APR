### Bugs in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset after consuming a new line character, leading to inaccurate line counting.
2. In the case of appending a line to the `lines` list, the return value should be `\n` inclusive, but the implementation misses that.

### Strategy to fix the bugs:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` after consuming a new line character.
2. Adjust the return value to include the consumed newline character when a full line is appended to the `lines` list.

### Corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Adjusted to include the newline character
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the flag after consuming new line
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True  # Set the flag to wait for newline
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
