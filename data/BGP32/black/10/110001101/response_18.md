The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error that prevents it from correctly handling prefixes that include newlines and indentation characters (spaces or tabs). The function is designed to consume the prefix until it reaches a specific column value and return the consumed part and the remaining prefix. However, the logic fails to correctly handle cases where newlines or tabs are encountered.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` counter to 0 when encountering a newline (`char == '\n'`). This leads to incorrect calculations of the column count and misjudges when to wait for a newline.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when encountering newline characters. The `current_column` should only reset to 0 if the line is not empty after consuming spaces or tabs. Additionally, the `wait_for_nl` flag should be reset when encountering newline character to handle the next line appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check for non-empty line before resetting column
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle cases involving newlines and indentation characters.
