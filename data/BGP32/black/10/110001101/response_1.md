The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how the function handles the indentation level of the prefix text. The issue arises when waiting for a new line to consume the prefix correctly while considering the specified column.

The problem lies in the condition where the function is checking for `wait_for_nl` and if `char == '\n'`. In that case, the function should check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column. If this condition is satisfied, it should include the current line in the result and reset the relevant variables.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition and logic regarding consuming the prefix correctly with the provided column value. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line in the result
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the column value provided.
