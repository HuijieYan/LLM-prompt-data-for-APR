### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of whitespace characters. The function is supposed to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. However, the logic for tracking the current column position is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the logic that updates the current column based on different characters encountered in the prefix. The issue arises when handling tab characters ('\t'), where the function mistakenly advances the column by 4 instead of the necessary 1.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of updating the current column based on different characters in the prefix. Specifically, when encountering a tab character, the current_column should only be increased by 1, not 4. Additionally, we need to ensure that the current_column is correctly updated for other characters as well to accurately track the position.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string until reaching the specified column limit, ensuring the expected output values are met in all test cases.
