### Error in the buggy function:
The buggy function fails to handle all cases where the column value is greater than the actual column position after consuming the prefix.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks if the current column position is less than the specified column value, leading to premature returning of the result before consuming the entire prefix.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we consume the prefix entirely and correctly check if the current column position is equal to or greater than the specified column value.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
