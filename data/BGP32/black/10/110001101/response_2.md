The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic to handle the columns and lines while consuming the prefix is incorrect. The function fails to update the current column value properly when encountering tabs or newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current column value is updated correctly for each character in the prefix, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newline characters. Additionally, we need to correctly handle waiting for a newline character before adding a line to the list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the current column value correctly for spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It also ensures that the logic for waiting for a newline character is handled properly.
