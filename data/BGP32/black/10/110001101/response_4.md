### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It iterates through the characters of the prefix string updating a current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to determine when to stop consuming characters. The function is intended to return the consumed characters until reaching a condition based on the column value.

### Bugs Identified
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is incorrect. It should compare `current_column` to `column` and check if `current_line` is not empty.
2. Some variables like `lines`, `current_line`, and `current_column` are not properly reset in some conditions leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the condition for consuming characters to properly compare the current column with the specified column value.
2. Reset the necessary variables when moving to a new line or when finishing consuming characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function includes adjustments to the comparison condition and properly resetting variables when necessary, ensuring the function behaves as expected.
