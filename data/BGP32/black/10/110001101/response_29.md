## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the current column count is not properly updated when encountering whitespace characters. This leads to an incorrect evaluation of whether the column condition is met, causing incorrect slices of the prefix string.

### Error Locations
1. The condition for updating the `current_column` count when encountering a space or tab character.
2. Incorrect handling of newlines where the `current_column` should be reset to 0.
3. Failure to properly insert the `current_line` into `lines` when a newline is found.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect updating of the `current_column` count when encountering space or tab characters. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual column counts, resulting in incorrect slicing of the prefix string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` count is correctly updated when encountering space or tab characters. Additionally, we should reset the `current_column` count to 0 when a newline is encountered. Proper handling of newlines to insert the `current_line` into `lines` is also necessary.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_column = 0
                        current_line = ""
                        wait_for_nl = False
                continue

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function ensures that the `current_column` count is properly updated for space, tab, and newline characters. It correctly handles the insertion of `current_line` into `lines` when necessary.
