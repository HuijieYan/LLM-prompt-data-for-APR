The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical issue with the condition to check if the current line should be split based on the column value. The bug occurs when the current line is empty while waiting for a new line character. In that case, the current column value should be considered for determining the need to split the line.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition where we check if the current line is empty. Instead of relying solely on the current line being empty, we should consider both the current line being non-empty and the current column exceeding the specified column value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fix ensures that the function correctly splits the lines based on the column value even when the current line is empty but the column exceeds the specified limit.
