The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to stem from how it handles the scenarios where it needs to wait for a newline character before processing the current line. Specifically, the condition for resetting `current_column` and `current_line` is not correctly triggered when encountering a newline character.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the loop that iterates over the characters in the `prefix` string. When a newline character is encountered, we should reset `current_column` and `current_line` only if `wait_for_nl` is True. Additionally, we need to reset `wait_for_nl` after handling the newline character.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that `current_column` and `current_line` are reset only when necessary after encountering a newline character while waiting for one.

Please test this corrected version with the provided runtime input values to verify that it now produces the expected output based on the failing tests.
