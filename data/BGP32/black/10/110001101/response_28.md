### Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the current column should reset to 0, but the code does not handle this correctly. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to calculate the remaining prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the current column is correctly reset to 0. This will allow for the correct calculation of the remaining prefix string.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered, fixing the bug in the function.
