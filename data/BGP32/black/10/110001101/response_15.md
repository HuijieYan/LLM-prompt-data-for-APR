The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` arises from the logic for handling the indent. The function incorrectly processes the newline character and resets the `current_column` incorrectly, which leads to incorrect calculation of the consumed prefix. Additionally, the condition for checking the indentation level is not properly handled, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for processing the characters in the prefix string and correctly track the current indentation level. We should also ensure that the consumed prefix is returned correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    # unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the consumed prefix is correctly calculated based on the specified column level. It properly handles the indentation with tabs and spaces, as well as newline characters, leading to the expected behavior according to the provided test cases.
