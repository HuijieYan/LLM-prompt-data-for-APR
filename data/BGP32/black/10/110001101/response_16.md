### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of indentation levels when encountering whitespace and tabs. The current implementation does not correctly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags, leading to incorrect behavior in identifying the right indentation level boundaries.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly update the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags based on the encountered characters (spaces, tabs, newline). Additionally, we should correctly handle cases where the current line is empty or too short compared to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:  
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Handle unexpected empty line correctly
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Testing the Corrected Version
The corrected function should now correctly identify the indentation levels and handle cases where the line is shorter than the specified column. By incorporating the fixes suggested above, the function should now pass all the failing test cases provided.
