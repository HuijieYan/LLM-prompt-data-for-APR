### Bug explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters a non-empty line followed by an empty line (indicated by the '\n' character). In such cases, the function incorrectly checks if the length of the current line is less than the specified `column` value. This logic leads to premature return of the accumulated lines without considering the entire prefix.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, the function should accumulate complete lines until it reaches the correct column position. Therefore, the function should accumulate lines until it encounters a non-empty line that reaches or exceeds the specified `column` value. This approach ensures that the function correctly processes the entire prefix.

### Corrected function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

The corrected function ensures that the lines are accumulated properly until reaching or exceeding the specified `column` value. This correction allows the function to correctly process the entire prefix and avoid premature returns.
