### Analysis:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels. The function is designed to consume a prefix until it reaches a certain column position, based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Error Location:
The main issue seems to be with the condition to check if the current column is less than the target column. The logic inside the `if char == '\n':` block should handle the partial consumption of the prefix properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to consume the prefix until a specific column. The function doesn't handle cases where the indent level is already greater than the target column. Instead of properly consuming the prefix up to the target column, it sometimes doesn't reset the `current_column` counter correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to make sure that the function properly consumes the prefix up to the target column. It is important to correctly handle the indentation levels, especially when dealing with spaces, tabs, and newlines within the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                else:
                    break
                
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        lines.append(current_line)
    
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

```

This corrected version ensures that the function properly consumes the prefix up to the target column position, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines. It avoids the issue of not resetting the `current_column` counter and handles the partial consumption of the prefix correctly.
