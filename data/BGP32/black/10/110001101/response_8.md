### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error in handling the line indentation, which causes incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix string. The function incorrectly checks for the end of the indentation by waiting for a newline character when it should check for newline or spaces/tabs. This leads to premature termination of the current line and incorrect handling of indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to modify the logic for detecting the end of the current line's indentation. Instead of only waiting for a newline character, we should check for newline characters or whitespace characters (spaces or tabs) to properly handle code indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n' or char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition `char == ' ' or char == '\t'` to the `if wait_for_nl` block, we ensure that the function correctly handles both newlines and whitespace characters to determine the end of the current line's indentation. This modification should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in all cases.
