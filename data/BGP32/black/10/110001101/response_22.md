### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition for checking if it should wait for a newline character (`'\n'`) is misplaced. This causes the function to miss adding the `current_line` to the `lines` list when encountering a newline character.

Specifically, the location of `wait_for_nl = False` should be moved to after `lines.append(current_line)` to ensure that the current line is added to the `lines` list before resetting `current_line` and waiting for a newline character.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the order of operations within the loop. Ensure that the current line is added to the `lines` list before resetting it and waiting for a newline character.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

With this correction, the function now properly handles adding the current line to the lines list before resetting it when encountering a newline character.
