### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling cases where the indentation level of the prefix does not match the given column value. The function is designed to consume prefix characters until it reaches a new line character that aligns with the specified column value, but it fails to do so in certain scenarios.

In Case 1, the function fails because it does not consider the scenario where the prefix starts with spaces before a comment. The function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` when encountering a space character, even though it should only wait for a new line if the column condition is not met.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels and updates the `wait_for_nl` flag only when necessary. The function should iterate over the prefix characters, keeping track of the current column position and waiting for a new line only when the specified column is not met.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the logic inside the loop to correctly handle the indentation and waiting for a new line, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
