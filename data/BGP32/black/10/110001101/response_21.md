### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition for checking `if wait_for_nl`. When `wait_for_nl` is False, the function should be checking for spaces, tabs, and newlines to determine when to append the current line to `lines`. However, the logic is incorrect, and the function fails to handle it properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the condition for `if wait_for_nl` needs to correctly handle the cases when a space, tab, or newline is encountered. The function should append the current line to `lines` only when `wait_for_nl` is True. Additionally, we need to ensure that `current_column` is updated correctly based on encountered characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 + 1
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the condition logic and ensuring `current_column` is updated properly, the function should now correctly handle cases where spaces, tabs, or newlines are encountered in the `prefix`. This corrected version should satisfy all the provided test cases and return the expected results.
