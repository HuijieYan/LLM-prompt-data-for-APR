The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the condition where the code checks if `char == '\n'`. When this condition is true, it resets the `current_column` to 0, which unintentionally disrupts the counting of the columns. This incorrect behavior causes the function to misinterpret the input and fail to return the expected results.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition for resetting `current_column` to only execute when the condition `char == '\n'` is `True` and the `wait_for_nl` flag is also `False`. This adjustment ensures that the column counting is reset only for actual newlines and not in the middle of counting indentations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and not wait_for_nl:
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised version should now correctly handle the indentation counting and successfully return the expected results for the given test cases.
