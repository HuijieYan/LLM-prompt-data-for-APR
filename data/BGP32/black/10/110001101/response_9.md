The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the calculation of the current column when encountering tabs. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` variable by 4 for each tab character, while it should actually increment it by the number of spaces necessary to reach the next tab position.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the function that handles tab characters. We should calculate the difference between the current column and the next multiple of 8 (assuming tab stops are at every 8 columns) and add that difference to the `current_column`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle tab characters and adjust the current column accordingly.
