### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic related to handling the indentation levels and waiting for new lines. The issue arises when dealing with whitespace characters like tabs and spaces, causing misalignment in the column count and the line generation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic to correctly update the `current_column` when encountering different types of whitespace characters.
2. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is toggled correctly to handle the transition from indentation to a new line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs and spaces, this corrected version of the function should now properly consume the prefix based on the given column limit.
