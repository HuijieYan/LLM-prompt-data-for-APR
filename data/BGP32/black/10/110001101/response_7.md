### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a portion of the input `prefix` string based on the `column` value. However, there are several issues with the current implementation:
1. The logic to handle indentation levels (spaces and tabs) is not updating the `current_column` correctly.
2. The condition to check if the current line length is less than the specified `column` is not functioning as expected.
3. The handling of newline characters and the resetting of `current_column` are not properly synchronized.
4. The function is returning the remaining prefix incorrectly.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not accurately track the `current_column` while considering the various characters in the prefix string. This leads to incorrect calculations of the indentation level and the column position within the line.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for tracking `current_column` based on different characters. Additionally, we should ensure that the detected newline characters reset the `current_column` value correctly. The function should properly consume the prefix up to the specified `column` value and update the remaining prefix accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrections, the function should now properly consume the prefix up to the specified column value and handle different types of characters correctly.
