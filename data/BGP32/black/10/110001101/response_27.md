### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because in the case where `wait_for_nl` is true and the current character encountered is a newline character (`char == '\n'`), the function does not properly handle the condition where the current column is less than the specified `column`.

In the buggy code, when the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is evaluated, it checks if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the specified column. If both conditions are met, it returns the concatenated lines and the remaining prefix.

However, in the case where the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to true and a newline character is encountered, if the current column is less than the specified column, the function should return the concatenated lines up to that point and the remaining prefix. But the current implementation mistakenly checks the condition after the newline is added to the current line, causing an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle the scenario where the current column is less than the specified column when encountering a newline character. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic to return the concatenated lines and the remaining prefix before the newline character is added to the current line.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res)+1:]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this adjustment, the corrected function now correctly handles the case where the current column is less than the specified column when encountering a newline character.
