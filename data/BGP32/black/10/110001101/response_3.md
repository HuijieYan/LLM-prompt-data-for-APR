## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition check when `wait_for_nl` is True on encountering a newline character. If the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified `column`, the code should calculate the result string up to that point and return the remaining prefix. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the calculation of the result string and the remaining prefix is done correctly when the conditions are met. We should slice the `prefix` string accordingly based on the calculated result string to return the correct remaining prefix.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected version of the function ensures that the correct result string is calculated based on the specified `column` and returns the remaining prefix appropriately.
