### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where it checks if `wait_for_nl` is `True`. The problem is that after the program encounters a newline character (`'\n'`), it immediately resets `current_column` to 0, without adding the current line to the `lines` list, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that whenever a newline character is encountered, the current line is added to the `lines` list before resetting `current_column`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version adds the current line to the `lines` list when encountering a newline character while maintaining correct `current_column` values, fixing the issue observed in the failing tests.
