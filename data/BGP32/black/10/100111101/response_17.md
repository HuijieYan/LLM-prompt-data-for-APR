### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how indented lines with comments are handled. The function incorrectly identifies the end of the indentation and includes the comment line in the output lines even when it should not be part of the processed section.

In cases where the comment line is on the same indentation level as the outer block's code, the function fails to correctly handle this scenario. This leads to incorrect output lines in the presence of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining when to include a line in the output lines. Specifically, we should only add lines to the output if they are within the specified column limit and omit lines that go beyond this limit, regardless of the presence of a comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle lines with comments in the provided test cases and pass the failing test.
