### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of indentation levels and newlines. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column. However, it fails to properly handle the case where there is a comment at an incorrect indentation level.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function encounters a situation where the comment is expected to be at a specific column but is not correctly consumed. This results in an assertion error because the function does not handle the indentation correctly, leading to an incorrect string comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly track the current indentation level and correctly handle cases where there are comments that impact the expected column. Specifically, when encountering a comment, the function should adjust the column count accordingly and correctly consume the necessary characters.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Adjust column count when encountering comment
            if char == '#':
                current_column = column
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column count when a comment is encountered, the corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
