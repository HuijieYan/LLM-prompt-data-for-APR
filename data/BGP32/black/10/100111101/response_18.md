### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the condition where the function is checking for the end of an indent (`wait_for_nl` is set to `True`). When encountering a newline character (`char == '\n'`), it should check if the current line is non-empty and if the column is less than the target column. However, in the current implementation, it is checking `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. This condition allows the current line to be stripped of spaces, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to directly check if `current_column < column`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected version directly checks `if current_column < column` without stripping the current line. This modification ensures correct behavior in handling the target column for the indent.
