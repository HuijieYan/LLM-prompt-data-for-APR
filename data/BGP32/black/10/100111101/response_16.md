### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix string up to a specific column. It iterates through the characters of the prefix, updating the current line, column, and whether it should wait for a new line to finish the indentation. The main issue seems to arise when encountering a newline character while waiting for a new line, affecting the column calculation.

### Bug Identification
Based on the provided test and input/output values, the bug appears to be related to the handling of newline characters. When encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline, the buggy function resets the current column to 0 instead of considering the indentation level. This leads to incorrect calculations of the consumed prefix portion, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case where the prefix is `'    # comment\n    '` and the column is 8, the buggy function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering the newline after `"comment\n"`. This reset causes an incorrect calculation of the consumed prefix, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained when encountering a newline while waiting for a new line. The `current_column` should reflect the indentation level of the existing line to accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column while handling indentation levels correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1  # Update column based on indentation depth
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version updates the `current_column` calculation when encountering a newline character while waiting for a new line, ensuring that the correct indentation level is maintained. This modification allows the function to accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column, resolving the bug.
