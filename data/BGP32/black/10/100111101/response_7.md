### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from not properly handling the case where a newline character is encountered during the prefix consumption process. In such cases, the function should reset the current line and column count and continue iterating over the prefix. However, the bug causes the function to not correctly handle the newline character within the prefix, leading to incorrect behavior when formatting the code.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly resets the current line and column count whenever a newline character is encountered in the prefix. This adjustment will allow the function to process the prefix as intended, producing the expected output for the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function properly handles newline characters within the prefix, ensuring that the indentation formatting is correctly applied. This revised implementation should pass the failing test cases provided.
