### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is designed to partially consume the given prefix until a specific column threshold is reached.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix, tracking the current line content, current column position, and whether it needs to wait for a new line.
3. The bug occurs when a comment in the prefix is encountered, leading to incorrect line formation due to the way indentation is handled.
4. The incorrect line formation causes the function to return an unexpected result, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the buggy function, the issue lies in the handling of indentation for comments.
- When encountering a comment in the prefix (character '#'), the function incorrectly handles the indentation level and does not wait for a new line correctly.
- This incorrect handling causes differences in the output compared to the expected result, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are correctly included in the lines formation, maintaining the correct indentation levels.
- Adjust the logic related to processing comments to ensure proper handling of indentation and line formation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Include the current line in the lines
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to accurately handle comments and indentation, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected behavior.
