### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from not correctly handling the case where a comment line starts with an indent. When the function encounters a newline character within a comment, it restarts the column count but does not consider the whitespace characters (' ' or '\t') at the beginning of the next line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the column count when a newline character is encountered within a comment line to consider the indent at the beginning of the next line.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # adjust column count for indent at the beginning of next line
            if prefix[current_column:].strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function will now properly handle the scenario where a comment line starts with an indent, ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained when consuming the prefix string.
