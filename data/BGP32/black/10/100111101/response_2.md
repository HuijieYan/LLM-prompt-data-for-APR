### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how the function handles the indentation levels when encountering a newline character in the `prefix`. The function is intended to consume white spaces and tabs until it reaches the specified `column` index, but it fails to handle cases where comments are present in the indentation.

In the failing test case, the input `prefix` contains a comment in between the indentation levels. The function incorrectly consumes these characters and fails to preserve the correct column alignment, which results in the assertion error.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the section where the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) in the `prefix`. The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to `0` without accounting for the existing indentation level due to comments.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when encountering a newline character. Instead of resetting `current_column` to `0`, we should update it to consider the existing indentation level before the comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = max(current_column, len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip()))
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic under the `elif char == '\n':` section to calculate the correct `current_column`, the corrected function should now handle the indentation levels correctly, including cases where comments are present within the indentation.
