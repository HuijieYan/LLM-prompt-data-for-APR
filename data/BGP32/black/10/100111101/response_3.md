### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters. The function is designed to consume a prefix until the column value is met. However, it fails to correctly handle the indentation levels when encountering newlines or spaces.

In the failing test case for `test_comment_indentation`, the expected output is failing because the function does not properly handle the indentation before the comment. The expected output includes the comment indented at the same level as the preceding code block. Still, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level, which leads to a mismatch in the generated strings.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels and newlines. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic to properly track the current column position and update it based on different indentation characters like spaces and tabs. Additionally, we should handle the case where a line contains only whitespace characters.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After making these fixes and running the failing test cases, the corrected function should now correctly handle the indentation and newline characters, resulting in the expected output strings aligning with the provided test cases.
