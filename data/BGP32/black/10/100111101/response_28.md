### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the function incorrectly handles the case where a comment is encountered before reaching the expected column. When the function encounters a comment (`'# comment'`) in the input `prefix`, it should consume the entire line containing the comment before returning the consumed lines and the remaining prefix. However, the function does not handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that determines when to wait for a newline character before consuming lines. Specifically, when encountering a comment, the function should consume the entire line containing the comment before further processing. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly consumes lines until reaching the expected column.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the entire line containing a comment is consumed before the function proceeds to check the column position, addressing the bug identified in the failing test cases.
