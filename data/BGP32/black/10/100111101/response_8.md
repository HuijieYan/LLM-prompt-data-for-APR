### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column number by checking for indentation in the form of spaces or tabs until a newline character. However, the bug causes the function to fail to handle comments correctly, leading to indentation errors in the output.

1. The function fails to correctly handle lines with comments that are not aligned with the expected column number.
2. The function does not account for cases where a line contains only comments.
3. Incorrect handling of newline characters in the context of comment lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to adjust the logic related to waiting for a newline character when encountering comments to maintain correct indentation. Additionally, special consideration should be given to handling comment-only lines and ensuring the correct handling of newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip() or current_column >= column:
                wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the logic adjustments suggested above, the corrected version of the function should now handle comments and indentation correctly, passing the failing test cases.
