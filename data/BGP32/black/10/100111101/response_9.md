### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels and waiting for newlines. The function fails to correctly account for columns when encountering tab characters and spaces, resulting in incorrect prefixes being extracted.

#### Issues:
1. The function improperly increments the `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character, instead of aligning it with the next tab stop.
2. The logic for determining when to end the indentation and wait for a newline is flawed, leading to premature skipping of relevant characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `current_column` is updated when encountering tabs and spaces, as well as refining the logic for identifying the end of an indentation sequence.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        # Handle tab characters
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
            current_column = next_tab_stop
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting how the columns are updated and refining the logic for detecting the end of an indentation sequence, this corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
