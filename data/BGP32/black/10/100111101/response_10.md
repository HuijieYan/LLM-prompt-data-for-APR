### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles indentation levels with different types of characters (spaces, tabs) before a comment. The function incorrectly processes the whitespace, resulting in an incorrect comparison of the indentation level with the expected column value.

In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the case where the prefix contains spaces followed by a comment starting with a '#' symbol. It fails to maintain the correct indentation level. As a result, it returns an unexpected output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function tracks and compares the indentation level. Specifically, we should update the logic to accurately count the number of spaces and tabs to determine the column position before a comment.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    lines.append(current_line)
    
    return ''.join(lines), ''
```

The corrected function now properly handles the counting of spaces and tabs for indentation levels before a comment, ensuring that the column comparison is accurate. This change should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected output for all cases.
