### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic when encountering a newline character. The function incorrectly handles newline characters, specifically in cases where there is a comment immediately following the newline character.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the input content contains scenarios where comments are placed after an indentation followed by a newline character. The function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the desired column when encountering such situations. This results in the mismatch between the actual and expected output, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where a comment or content follows a newline character, ensuring that the prefix up to the desired column is correctly consumed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to handle the newline character correctly, ensuring that it consumes the prefix up to the desired column even when comments or content follow the newline character. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
