The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels in the input prefix. When encountering spaces and tabs, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect indentation tracking.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to correctly calculate the column when encountering spaces or tabs. We should base the tab width increment on the current column value to ensure proper indentation tracking.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Define tab width as 4 spaces
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the tab width is taken into account correctly, fixing the bug in the original implementation. By using the tab width to calculate the column increment, we ensure proper handling of indentation levels. This fix should make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
