### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing the test case `test_comment_indentation` to fail. The issue lies in how the function handles newlines (`\n`) and indents within the provided `prefix`.

When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the function resets the `current_column` to 0 but does not properly check the remaining characters after the newline to adjust for the indentation. This leads to incorrect behavior when handling indents and newlines together, as observed in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newlines while considering the indentation levels. We should adjust the logic to properly handle cases where newlines are followed by indents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle newlines and indentation levels, ensuring that the expected output matches the actual output for the failing test cases.
