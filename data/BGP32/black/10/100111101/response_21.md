### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain specified column value. The bug occurs when the function encounters a situation where it needs to wait for a newline character before continuing to consume the prefix. In such cases, the function did not correctly handle the indentation level in relation to the specified column.

Analyzing the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values revealed that the function did not account for the indentation level when waiting for a newline character. This caused incorrect detection of the correct prefix to consume, leading to failed test cases such as `test_comment_indentation`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that when the function is waiting for a newline character to continue consuming the prefix, it correctly checks the column position of the current line based on the specified column value. This involves handling indentation levels like spaces and tabs appropriately to determine whether to include a line in the consumed prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Include lines with column <= specified column
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the condition to include lines with a column value less than or equal to the specified column, the corrected function now correctly consumes the prefix up to the desired column value, accounting for the correct indentation levels. This correction should resolve the bug, allowing the function to pass the failing test cases.
