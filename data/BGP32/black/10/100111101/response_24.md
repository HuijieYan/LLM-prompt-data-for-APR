### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters. When constructing `lines`, the function prematurely includes lines that should not be part of the consumed prefix.

1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly adds `current_line` to `lines` before checking if the current line is empty and the indentation level is less than `column`, causing incorrect output.
2. In Case 3, the function does not handle the initial tab character correctly, resulting in an incorrect `current_column` and `current_line`.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust the logic for `lines` addition and improve the handling of different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to accurately identify and separate lines based on indentation levels.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

After implementing the corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the input properly and pass the failing test cases.
