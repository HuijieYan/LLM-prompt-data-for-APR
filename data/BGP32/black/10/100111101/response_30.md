### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of newline characters while consuming the prefix string. Specifically, when encountering a newline character, the function resets the `current_column` incorrectly, which leads to misaligned output strings.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is properly updated when a newline character is encountered. The function should properly track the actual column position within each line to handle indentation correctly. Additionally, the conditional check for updating `current_column` based on the character type should be revised to cover all cases accurately.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of newline characters and updating the `current_column` properly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and produce the expected output.
