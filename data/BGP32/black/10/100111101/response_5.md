### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a specific column count is reached. However, the bug occurs when a comment is encountered before the expected column count. The function fails to handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect output.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, when a comment is encountered before the expected column count, the function does not correctly consume the prefix, causing a mismatch in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the case where a comment is present before the expected column count. Specifically, when encountering a comment, it should check if the comment starts before the target column and adjust the prefix consumption accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            # Check for comments
            if current_column <= column:
                wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including a check for comments and adjusting the prefix consumption logic accordingly, the corrected function should now handle the case where comments disrupt the indentation level.
