### Bug Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to the way the function handles whitespace characters and indentation levels. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column number, but it fails to correctly handle tab characters and empty lines.

In the failing test case for `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails because it incorrectly handles the position of the comment relative to the indentation level.

Here are some identified issues:
1. The function does not properly handle tabs, which should increment the `current_column` by 4 but instead increments only by 1 for each tab character.
2. The logic to check for the end of an indentation level and wait for a new line is flawed, leading to incorrect line splitting and slicing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters to correctly increment the `current_column` by 4. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the end of an indentation level and waits for a new line before adding it to the list of lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            if char not in (' ', '\t'):
                wait_for_nl = True
            
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle indentation levels and comments within the prefix string.
