### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters a line break (`'\n'`) while processing the input prefix string. The current implementation incorrectly resets the `current_column` count to 0 when it encounters a line break, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` count does not reset to 0 when encountering a line break. Instead, it should only reset when encountering a newline character if the `wait_for_nl` flag is set. This will maintain correct indentation calculations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n' and not wait_for_nl:
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle line breaks correctly and pass the failing test.
