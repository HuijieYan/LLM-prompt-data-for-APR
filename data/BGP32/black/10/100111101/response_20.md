### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from how it handles the indentation of comments. The function is designed to consume the prefix text up to a certain column, but it fails to handle cases where comments appear at the intended column position. This causes the function to incorrectly consume part of the comment text, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output.

Looking at the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the test creates two versions of Python code with different indentations and comments. The bug becomes evident when the function `_partially_consume_prefix` consumes the prefix text up to a certain column, encountering a comment close to the specified column limit.

In Case 1, for example, the bug arises when the function wrongly interprets the comment `# comment\n` as part of the indentation, causing it to consume a portion of the comment text and leading to an assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function handles comment lines to prevent them from being consumed as part of the prefix indentation. Specifically, we should skip over comment lines during the prefix consumption process to preserve their original alignment.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check for the presence of a comment line
            if '#' in current_line:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles comment lines within the prefix text, ensuring that they are not mistakenly consumed as part of the indentation process. This fix should enable the function to pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and align with the expected input/output values.
