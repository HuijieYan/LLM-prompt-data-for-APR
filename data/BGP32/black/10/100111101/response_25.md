### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation in the input prefix string. The function incorrectly skips over spaces and tabs when calculating the indentation level, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual output.

In the failing test case, the function fails to correctly process the input prefix string that contains comments with different indentation levels. The function fails to properly adjust the column value based on the indentation level of the comments, resulting in incorrect output and causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the function accurately calculates the correct indentation level by considering spaces and tabs properly. Additionally, the function should handle comments with varying indentation levels to generate the expected output. 

By adjusting the logic that updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the input characters, we can correct the behavior of the function and ensure that it produces the expected output for the given test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the changes above, the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now accurately handle the indentation of comments and produce the expected output for the failing test cases.
