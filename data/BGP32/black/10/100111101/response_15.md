### Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a specified column value. The bug in the function seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation levels before comments, leading to incorrect output in certain cases.

### Issues:
1. The function does not correctly handle spaces/tabs before comments.
2. The logic to wait for a new line after encountering indentation does not work as intended.
3. Incorrectly handling new lines without indentation impacts the final result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle spaces/tabs before comments.
2. Adjust the condition to wait for a new line only after encountering full indentation.
3. Modify the handling of new lines without indentation to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After fixing the function as outlined above, it should now correctly handle the partial consumption of prefixes based on column values and pass the failing test cases.
