## Correction:

The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent in the `Driver._partially_consume_prefix` function. To address this issue, we need to modify how the function tracks and processes the indentation levels when encountering comments. By properly identifying the column levels and line breaks, we can ensure that the comments are correctly aligned with their code blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    if char != '\n':
                        current_column += 1
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version improves the handling of comments and ensures that the comments retain their proper indentation levels relative to the code blocks. By accurately tracking the current column position and newline characters, this function will now correctly consume and process the prefix input.

After applying this correction, the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should pass, and the function should behave as expected based on the provided test cases and the reported GitHub issue.
