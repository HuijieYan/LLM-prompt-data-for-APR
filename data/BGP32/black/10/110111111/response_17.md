## Correction:

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic for handling the cases involving indentation and comments correctly. We can update the function based on the analysis of the failing test cases and the expected outcomes.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset the current_column when encountering a newline
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes modifications to handle the correct indentation count for comments and addresses the issue observed in the failing test cases.

By updating the function as shown above, the `test_comment_indentation` test should pass successfully with the corrected logic.
