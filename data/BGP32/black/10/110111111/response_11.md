## Bug Explanation

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to process a prefix string and return a subset based on a given column value. The bug arises from incorrect column tracking logic when encountering tab characters. The issue occurs when trying to handle comments at specific indentation levels, leading to incorrect formatting.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks situations where comments are placed within nested if blocks with mixed tab and space indentation. The current logic does not handle the difference in column calculation between tabs and spaces correctly, resulting in misalignment of comments.

The root cause lies in the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tabs. For each tab encountered, the `current_column` is incremented by 4, leading to incorrect column tracking relative to the actual character position in the prefix string.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To address this bug, the function needs a modification in the handling of tab characters regarding column tracking. When encountering a tab, we need to update the `current_column` based on the column of the next tab stop, aligning with Python's standard tab size of 4 spaces. Additionally, adjustments in logic for handling comments and whitespace indentation are necessary to ensure correct prefix subset extraction.

The function should correctly identify the actual column position in the prefix string considering tabs and spaces. By updating the logic related to tab characters and whitespace handling, the function can precisely remove the prefix based on the given column.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and self.calculate_column(current_line, column) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Correctly handle tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

def calculate_column(self, line, target_column):
    column = 0
    for char in line:
        if char == ' ':
            column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            column += 4 - (column % 4)
        else:
            return column
    return column
```

In this corrected version, the `calculate_column` function is introduced to determine the actual column position in a line considering both tabs and spaces. The main processing loop within `_partially_consume_prefix` now correctly adjusts the `current_column` for tab characters and handles whitespace indentation to extract the desired prefix subset accurately.

This corrected version should resolve the issue related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent, ensuring consistent formatting for mixed tab and space indentation scenarios.
