To fix the identified bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic related to handling indentation and tracking the current column index. The current implementation does not properly handle the indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior.

Let's update the logic to correctly track the indentation level and handle newline characters. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        
        if current_line.strip():
            lines.append(current_line)
            
        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
```

This corrected version should address the indentation and newline character handling issues in the original function. When testing with the provided failing test cases, the corrected function should now produce the expected output, resolving the reported bug on GitHub about incorrect indentation for tabulated comments.
