To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the handling of whitespace characters to correctly track the current column and ensure that comments are aligned properly with the code blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Explanation of the changes made:
1. Adjusted the handling of tab characters (`\t`) to properly increment the `current_column` by the appropriate amount.
2. Added a condition to reset `current_column` when encountering a newline (`\n`) if `wait_for_nl` is `True`.
3. Modified the condition for incrementing `current_column` for spaces to include adding the character to `current_line`.
4. Moved the condition checking for characters other than whitespace to handle advancing to the next line or completing the indentation.

By applying these modifications, the function will correctly align comments with the code based on the specified column value, resolving the indentation issue highlighted in the failing test.
