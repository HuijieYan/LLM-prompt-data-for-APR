## Correction:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when processing tabulations and determining correct indentation for comments. The issue stems from incorrect handling of the whitespace characters, especially tabs, in the `prefix`.

To address the bug, modify the function to correctly handle the tabulation characters to ensure that comments are correctly indented. A revised strategy might include addressing tabulation logic and ensuring proper increment of `current_column`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line + '\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version aims to properly handle tabulation and align comments in cases where tabs are used for indentation.

Test the revised function against the failing test to ensure it now passes without altering the formatting.
