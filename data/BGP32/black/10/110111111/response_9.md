To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the indentation. The issue arises when a comment line is encountered after a dedent, and the function does not maintain the correct indentation for such lines.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided function, the bug occurs because the logic to handle comments is based on spaces and tabs without considering the cases where comments appear after dedentations. This leads to incorrect indentation being applied to comments.

To address this issue and fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the scenario where comments are present after dedentations and ensure that the indentation is maintained correctly.

### Revised `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # Dedent is finished
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the function to consider the specific case of comments after dedented lines, we ensure that the correct indentation is maintained for such scenarios. This revised function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.

After applying this fix, the `test_comment_indentation` function should pass without any assertion errors and correctly handle comments after dedentations, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
