## Correction

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it is clear that the issue arises due to incorrect handling of indentation after dedent operations. 

The initial version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix` contained a logic flaw in shifting the indentation levels when encountering a newline character especially in the presence of spaces or tabs. To fix this, we need to adjust how the function deals with indentations and newline characters to maintain the correct alignment.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            # Handling for spaces and tabs
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:  # For other characters
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == '\n':  # If a newline is encountered
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Append the current line
                    current_line = ""  # Reset the line
                    current_column = 0  # Reset the column count
                else:  # Indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the function to properly handle newline characters and maintain correct indentation levels, the updated function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
