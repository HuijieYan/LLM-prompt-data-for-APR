To address the issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug causing the incorrect behavior of changing comment indentation after a dedent needs to be fixed. By analyzing the function and the failing test cases provided, it appears that the bug arises when parsing tab character ('\t') in the `prefix` string, leading to incorrect column calculation.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating how the function handles tab characters in the `prefix` string and adjusting the column calculations accordingly. By ensuring proper handling of tabs, the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix string up to a specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                tabs = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate remaining spaces to the next tab stop
                current_line += ' ' * tabs
                current_column += tabs
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that tabs are correctly converted to spaces based on the remaining spaces needed to reach the next tab stop (4 spaces). This adjustment should address the issue reported in the failing test and align with the expected input/output values provided.

After applying this fix, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should behave correctly according to the test cases and should no longer cause comment indentation errors after a dedent when using tab characters.
