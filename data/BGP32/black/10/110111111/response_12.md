Based on the analysis of the provided information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation when waiting for a new line after a non-indent character. This leads to incorrect column tracking, resulting in incorrect indentation in the output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the indentation is correctly preserved when waiting for a new line. We can achieve this by adjusting the logic within the loop that processes each character in the prefix. Specifically, we need to handle the case where a non-indent character is encountered and correctly adjust the current line and column values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line = current_line.rstrip()  # Remove trailing spaces
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)
            current_column = column + 1
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making adjustments to handle non-indent characters and correctly updating the current line and column values, this corrected version should fix the indentation issue in the output and address the failing test cases.
