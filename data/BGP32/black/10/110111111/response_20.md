## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is disaligning comments after dedents when using tabs for indentation.
   
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare the formatting of content with tabs and spaces, where the indentation for comments should be consistent regardless of the indents.

3. The error message highlights an assertion failure due to inconsistent comment indentation.

4. The buggy function is not handling the case where comments are present after dedents properly, leading to the disalignment of comments.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in handling comment indentation following dedents. When encountering non-space characters after an indent, the code incorrectly resets the indentation variables, leading to inconsistent comment alignment after dedents.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle preserving the column for comments after a dedent.
2. Ensure that when the function encounters non-space characters after an initial indent, it retains the correct column position for any subsequent comments.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle the case where newline resets the column count
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Adjust the handling of comments to preserve correct column position
                if char == '#':
                    wait_for_nl = True
                elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle comments after dedents correctly, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now maintain the proper comment alignment in the presence of tabs and spaces.
