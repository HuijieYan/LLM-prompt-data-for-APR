Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test cases, the issue arises because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation levels and new lines when waiting for a new line after dedent. This leads to incorrect handling of comments after dedents, ultimately causing the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly track the current column and properly handle cases where a new line is encountered after dedent. Additionally, the function should correctly preserve the original formatting of comments after dedents.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)  # preserve the new line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and new lines after dedents, preserving the original formatting of comments after the dedents. This should address the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
