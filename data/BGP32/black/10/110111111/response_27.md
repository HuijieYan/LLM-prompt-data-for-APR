## Correction:

The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of whitespace characters, especially when counting the column position for different types of characters like tabs and spaces. The logic to handle the columns and wait for a newline character needs to be adjusted to account for proper indentation.

To correct this issue, we need to adjust the column count based on the type of whitespaces encountered and correctly set the flag `wait_for_nl` to control when to stop counting columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation correctly, ensuring that comments are properly aligned after dedent operations. This change should address the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
