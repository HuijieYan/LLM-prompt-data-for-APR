### Explanation of the Bug:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of the indentations and keeping track of columns when encountering tab characters (`\t`). The function fails to correctly adjust the column count for tab characters, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with comments and indentation levels.

In the failing test for `test_comment_indentation`, the function is expected to maintain the correct indentation and handle comments properly. However, due to the incorrect handling of tab characters and columns, the function fails to align the comments as expected, resulting in the test failures.

The runtime values and types of variables in the buggy function reflect discrepancies in the column count, handling of tabs, and the correct construction of `lines` and `current_line` variables, leading to the failing behavior observed during execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To resolve the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be modified to correctly handle tab characters, update column counts accurately, and adjust the construction of `lines` and `current_line` at each iteration through the prefix string. It is crucial to ensure that the function correctly maintains the indentation levels based on the encountered characters to align comments and code appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust column count for tab characters
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    current_column += 1
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments in the function, the corrected version should correctly handle tab characters, maintain the correct column counts, and ensure the expected alignment of comments within the code, resolving the issue and passing the failing test scenarios.
