## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in how the function handles whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) and calculations of the current column position.

Based on the provided information, a potential strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the logic in the function to accurately calculate the indentation and track the positions of comments correctly based on the whitespace characters encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4) # Adjust the column position for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes adjustments for tab whitespace character handling by adjusting the column position accordingly.

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly handle indentation, ensuring that comments are correctly aligned based on the input prefix and column position.
