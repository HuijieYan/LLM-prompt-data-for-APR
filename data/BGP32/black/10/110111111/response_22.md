The issue in the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` lies in the incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines when dealing with comments. 

The root cause of the bug can be identified from the failing test `test_comment_indentation` which tests the function with different input contents, specifically focusing on comments and the indentation associated with them.

The failing test identifies a discrepancy between the expected output and the actual output when handling comments at different indentation levels. The error message points out that the comment indentation is not kept consistent with the code indentation after dedents, which is crucial for preserving the original code structure.

To address the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure that the comment indentation is correctly maintained after dedents.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    # Corrected version of the function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the corrected version of the function, the comment indentation should now be correctly preserved after dedents, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
