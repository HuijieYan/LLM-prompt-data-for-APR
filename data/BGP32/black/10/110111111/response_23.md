## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue arises when waiting for a new line while processing the input prefix. In some cases, the indentation for comments is not preserved as expected.

The correction involves ensuring that the correct handling of spaces and tabs preserves the intended indentation for comments after dedentations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction explicitly accounts for when the indentation is finished and properly aligns comments to the expected column after dedentations.

This updated version should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
