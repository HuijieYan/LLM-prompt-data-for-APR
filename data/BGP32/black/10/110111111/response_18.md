The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the processing of indentation within the prefix string while handling comments. The issue is that when encountering a comment, the function does not correctly align it with the preceding code for certain cases.

The main problem stems from the `wait_for_nl` logic. When encountering a comment, the function expects an empty line after the comment to dedent properly. However, this behavior is incorrect, especially when comments are part of indented blocks.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in such a way that when encountering a comment, the function should maintain the current indentation level until a new line (with or without content) is found. This approach would ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the preceding code, keeping the intended structure intact.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected implementation should now handle the indentation of comments correctly and align them properly with the relevant code sections. The function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy the expected input/output values specified.
