### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error when handling the situation where a comment appears right after a dedented line. Specifically, when the function encounters a character that is not a space or tab while waiting for a new line, it should reset the column count, but currently, it is not doing so. This results in the incorrect calculation of the indentation level for the comment line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a non-space or non-tab character is encountered while waiting for a new line after a dedent, the column count is reset to zero. This will ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained for subsequent lines.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Reset column count after dedent
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` to 0 after encountering a non-space or non-tab character, we ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments after a dedent. This correction should address the bug and make the function handle the indentation logic correctly as expected.
