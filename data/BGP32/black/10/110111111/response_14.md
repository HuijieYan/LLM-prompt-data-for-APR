Based on the analysis provided above, it seems that the issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the condition where `char == '\n'` is not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. This results in incorrect behavior when formatting the code, leading to failing tests.

To address this issue and align the function with the expected input/output values, we need to make adjustments to how the newline character (`\n`) is handled. Specifically, we should ensure that comments are correctly aligned after dedents.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we adjusted how the newline character is handled to ensure that the indentation of comments after a dedent is maintained correctly. By making these changes, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing tests related to comment indentation in the provided test cases.
