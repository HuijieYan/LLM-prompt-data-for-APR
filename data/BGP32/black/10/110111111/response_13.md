Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the main issue is related to how indentation is handled for comments after dedents. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` checks the whitespace characters in the `prefix` string to determine indentation levels. However, it fails to correctly handle cases where there are comments at a deeper level of indentation.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not properly preserving the correct indentation for comments after dedents, leading to assertions failures.

To address this issue, it's important to correctly preserve the indentation of comments in the `prefix` string when handling dedents. This can be achieved by modifying the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly account for comments and their indentation levels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    break
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic as suggested above, the corrected function should now properly preserve the indentation levels for comments after dedents, resolving the failing tests and addressing the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments.
