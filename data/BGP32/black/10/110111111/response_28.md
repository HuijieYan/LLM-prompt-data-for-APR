### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to remove leading spaces or tabs from a prefix of a string up to a specified column. However, there is an issue where tab characters are being handled incorrectly, causing the indentation errors observed in the failing test.

The function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered. This results in incorrect column tracking when tabs are present, leading to inaccurate dedent logic and incorrect indentation, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the function should correctly handle tab characters by incrementing the `current_column` based on the actual tab width, which is typically 8 spaces. By adjusting the column tracking logic for tabs, the function can correctly identify the end of the desired prefix.

### Corrected Code:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                tab_spaces = 8 - (current_column % 8)
                for _ in range(tab_spaces):
                    current_line += ' '
                    current_column += 1
                continue
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling tab characters and adjusting the column tracking logic, the corrected function should now pass the failing test without causing incorrect indentation.
