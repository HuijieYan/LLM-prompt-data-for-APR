To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust how the handling of indentation and new lines is processed. The issue arises when dealing with the indentation levels of comments after dedents, where the comment indentation is incorrect. The function should correctly handle the proper indentation of comments matching the surrounding code.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                    current_line += '\t'
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_line += char
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version makes sure that the comment indentation aligns correctly with the code regardless of indentation levels.

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments and align them as expected, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
