Based on the analysis, the bug occurs when computing the indentation of comments after a dedent. The key issue arises from not correctly handling the indentation level for comments. To address this, it is crucial to ensure that comments are aligned and indented correctly based on Black's formatting rules.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures consistent handling of line breaks and correct indentation levels for comments based on the Black formatting rules. By adjusting the indentation logic, the function now aligns comments as expected after a dedent operation.

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent in tab-indented code.
