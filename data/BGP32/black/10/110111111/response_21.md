To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the indentation level of comments when dealing with tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust the tab indentation properly
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The key change made in the corrected version is to properly handle tab indentation by adjusting the current indentation column when encountering a tab character. By calculating the appropriate tab space based on the current indentation level, the function now handles tabulated comments correctly after a dedent.

This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
