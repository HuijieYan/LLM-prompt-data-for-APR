The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string character by character until it reaches a specific column. The function incorrectly handles newline characters when determining the column position and tracking the lines. This leads to incorrect indentation processing, as exposed by the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The function is unable to maintain proper comment indentation in the presence of tabs.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the handling of newline characters accounts for the correct column positions and properly aligns the comments without changing their indentation relative to the surrounding code.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        pristine_column = column
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < pristine_column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_column = 0
                current_column += 1
            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
1. We introduce `pristine_column` to store the original column value to track the desired indentation position correctly.
2. We append the newline character to the current line, preserving the original structure of the prefix.
3. We adjust the logic for updating the current column when encountering characters other than whitespace characters.
4. We correctly handle the case where a newline is within the whitespace block.

By applying these modifications, the function should now accurately process the prefix string while maintaining correct comment indentation. This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the reported GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments.
