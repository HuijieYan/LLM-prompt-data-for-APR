Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the cause of the bug is related to how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles the indentation levels for lines containing comments. The function wrongly processes lines with comments at a different indentation level, leading to an incorrect output.

To address this issue, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle different levels of indentation when encountering comments. The function should maintain the proper alignment based on the given `column` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update column based on tab count
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters in the input, ensuring that the function correctly computes the column based on the tab count. This modification should address the indentation issue observed in the failing test cases.
