### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on the provided column.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column count, and whether to wait for a new line.
3. The bug seems to arise because the code does not handle the case where the comment is at the start of the line without preceding whitespace correctly.
4. The function should consume characters until the specified column is reached, regardless of whether there is whitespace or not.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because when a comment is at the start of a line without any preceding whitespace, the function incorrectly waits for a newline before returning the consumed prefix. This results in the comment not being aligned correctly when there is no whitespace preceding it.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the logic to handle the case where a comment is at the start of a line without preceding whitespace.
2. Ensure that the function consumes characters until the specified column is reached, regardless of the presence of whitespace.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif current_column >= column and char not in [' ', '\t']:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By introducing the additional check for column alignment regardless of whitespace presence, the corrected function should now handle the mentioned edge case and correctly align comments based on the specified column count.
