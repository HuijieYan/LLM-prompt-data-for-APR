### Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic used to handle the indentation levels corresponding to tabs and spaces. In particular, when encountering tab characters (`\t`), the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of aligning it with the next tab stop. This results in a misalignment of the columns, affecting the correct detection of the column where a comment should be inserted.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for incrementing the `current_column` when encountering tab characters (`\t`). Instead of incrementing by a fixed amount (4), we should align it with the next tab stop based on the column number. This adjustment ensures that the column tracking is correct regardless of tab or space characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)  # Align to the next tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Rationale

- The correction introduces a new calculation to align the `current_column` to the next tab stop whenever a tab character is encountered. This adjustment ensures correct column tracking, especially when dealing with indentation levels defined by tabs.
- By aligning with the next tab stop, the function now accurately determines the column number for comment insertion, resolving the bug identified in the failing test cases.

After applying this correction, the function should now handle tab characters correctly and pass the failing test cases.
