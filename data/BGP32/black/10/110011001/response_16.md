### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a specified column is reached, handling newline characters and indentation correctly. However, the function fails to handle some cases where comments are involved, leading to incorrect output.

#### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` might not correctly check for the column position after the last consumed line.
   
2. The handling of comments and empty lines seems incorrect, possibly causing the function to skip valid lines.

### Bug Explanation
When processing prefixes containing comments or empty lines, the function fails to accurately calculate the column position and correctly evaluate when to stop consuming lines. This discrepancy between expected and actual behavior results in incorrect output for certain test cases, as shown in the provided error message.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the column position during indentation, handles comments and empty lines effectively, and stops consuming lines when the specified column is reached. Adjusting the conditions regarding column comparison and handling comments properly should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for proper tab calculation
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:  # Include lines below column position
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function implements necessary adjustments to correctly handle comments, empty lines, and calculate the column position accurately. The function should now consume the prefix as intended and pass the failing test cases.
