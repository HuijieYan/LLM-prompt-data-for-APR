### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. However, there are multiple issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior and cause the failing tests. The key problems are as follows:
1. The logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` condition is flawed. When encountering a newline character while waiting, the function attempts to split the current line and store it in `lines`, but the logic to correctly update `current_column` and `current_line` is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. In some cases, the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character ('\t'). This is problematic because tabs should represent a single level of indentation, not 4 spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic within the function `_partially_consume_prefix` to properly handle the various cases of characters encountered in the prefix. Specifically, we need to ensure that `current_line`, `current_column`, and `lines` are updated correctly according to the indentation levels and column limits.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    current_line = current_line.strip()
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line + char)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += ' '
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the conditional checks and updating the handling of `current_line`, `current_column`, and `lines` correctly, the function should now work as intended and pass the failing tests.
