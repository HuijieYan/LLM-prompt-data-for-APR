### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column. However, based on the failing test and the runtime values provided, it seems that the function fails to correctly handle comments. Specifically, comments are not properly handled when determining the current column, which results in the incorrect output.

The key issues seem to be:
1. Comments are not considered when calculating the current column.
2. The function does not correctly handle the case when a comment is on the same line as code.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the function not treating comments as part of the line when calculating the current column. This leads to discrepancies in the current column calculation and the correct prefix consumption.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To address the bug, we need to ensure that comments are properly accounted for when calculating the current column. Additionally, we should correctly handle the case when a comment is on the same line as code to prevent issues in the prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line for a new line
        else:
            # Check for comment on the same line
            if char == '#' and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary
By updating the function to correctly handle comments in the current column calculation and to handle comments on the same line as code, we can ensure the correct prefix consumption behavior. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
