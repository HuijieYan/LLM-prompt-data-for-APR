### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a certain column number is reached. However, based on the failing test and the runtime values, the function is not handling newlines properly, which causes incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function fails to correctly handle newlines. When encountering a newline character, it should reset the `current_column` count to 0. Instead, it is skipping this reset, leading to column counting issues.
2. The condition to handle the end of the prefix is not triggered correctly when there is a newline character within the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Adjust the behavior when encountering newline characters to properly reset the column count.
2. Ensure that the condition to handle the end of the prefix triggers correctly when a newline character is present.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After implementing these modifications, the function should now properly handle newlines and correctly consume the prefix until the specified column is reached. This correction should address the failing test case provided.
