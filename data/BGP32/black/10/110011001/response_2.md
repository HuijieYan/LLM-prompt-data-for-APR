### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. However, there is a logical error in the handling of new lines within the prefix, causing issues with indentation management.

### Error
The key issue lies in how the function handles new lines. The `else` block following the check for a new line sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` to indicate that an indent sequence is finished without consuming the new line character. This strategy is incorrect as it leads to inconsistencies in handling indentation within the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should revise how the new line handling is managed. Instead of setting `wait_for_nl` to `True` unconditionally for all characters other than spaces and tabs, we should base this decision on whether the current line has content or not. Additionally, we should consider handling the case when the prefix ends with a non-empty line that is not followed by a new line character.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    consumed = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        consumed += 1
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[consumed:]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the new line handling and adjusting the condition for when to wait for a new line before proceeding, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test scenarios.
