### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a specific column alignment. The function seems to have issues correctly handling some cases involving indentation-related characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Bug Cause
1. When encountering a newline character (`char == '\n'`), the function should reset the `current_column` to 0. However, in the current implementation, the function fails to do so, leading to incorrect column tracking for subsequent lines.
2. The logic for handling tabs (`char == '\t'`) to increment `current_column` by 4 is not suitable as tabs usually represent one level of indentation. This discrepancy causes misalignment calculations.
3. The function waits for a newline character after encountering an indent character (`else` statement) to update `wait_for_nl`. However, it should also wait for a newline character when current_column is already equal to the target column to correctly align the output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to:
1. Reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. Adjust the `current_column` increment for tabs to be 1 instead of 4.
3. Update `wait_for_nl` not only when encountering an indent character but also when the current_column reaches the target column.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = current_column == column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By applying these corrections, the function should now handle indentation correctly and pass the failing tests.
