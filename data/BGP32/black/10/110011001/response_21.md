### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column number. It processes each character of the prefix string until it reaches the specified column number and then returns the consumed part of the prefix along with the remaining part.

### Error location

The bug seems to be located in the condition where it should check if the current column number is less than the specified column to terminate the consumption of the prefix line. The condition `current_column < column` is incorrectly placed, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is not being properly evaluated due to its position right after checking for a newline character. This causes the function to incorrectly handle cases where the column limit is not exceeded and there is a newline character in the prefix.

### Bug-fixing strategy

To fix the bug, the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` should be moved out of the nested block where it currently resides. It should be placed right after the character handling logic to properly check if the consumed prefix line length is less than the specified column number.

### Buggy function with bug fixed

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By moving the condition `current_line.strip() and current_column < column` outside of the nested block with the `wait_for_nl` check and newline character handling, the function will correctly handle cases where the consumed line length is less than the specified column limit.
