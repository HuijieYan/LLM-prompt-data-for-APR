### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a specific column width is reached or a certain condition is met. The bug seems to stem from the handling of indentation in the prefix string.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) before reaching the target column width and has wait_for_nl set to True. In this case, it incorrectly captures the newline character in the current_line before validating the indentation against the target column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles newline characters correctly and updates the relevant variables to maintain the correct state for consuming the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            else:
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes a reorganized logic to correctly handle newline characters, indentation spaces, and tabs. It ensures that the function consumes the prefix string until the specified column width is reached.
