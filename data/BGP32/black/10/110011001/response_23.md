### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix string based on a specified column value. It processes the characters in the prefix and accumulates them until it reaches the desired column or encounters a new line character. There are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect behavior.

### Bugs
1. Incorrect handling of new line characters (e.g., missing incrementing column number and appending lines correctly)
2. Mismanagement of the `wait_for_nl` flag, leading to premature termination of line processing
3. Inconsistent handling of spaces and tabs in calculating the current column

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
1. Ensure proper handling of new line characters to reset the current column and append new lines correctly.
2. Adjust the `wait_for_nl` logic to correctly indicate when to wait for a new line to terminate line processing.
3. Update the logic for incrementing the current column based on spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Append only non-empty lines
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the corrected version, we ensure proper handling of new line characters, reset the current column appropriately, and manage the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly to address the identified bugs.
