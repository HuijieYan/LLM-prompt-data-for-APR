### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, there is an issue in the logic related to handling the indentation before a comment. The function is not correctly counting the spaces and tabs in the prefix string to determine the correct column value of the comment. This leads to incorrect splitting of the prefix string and results in failing test cases.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the section where the function is checking for spaces and tabs in the prefix string to calculate the current column value. Specifically, the problem lies in the comparison of the current column value with the specified `column` input parameter, which is intended to represent the expected indentation level for the comment.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function is not updating the `current_column` properly when encountering spaces or tabs in the prefix string. The error causes the function to incorrectly identify whether the comment should be included in the `lines` list or appended to the `current_line` string. As a result, the comment's indentation is not correctly determined.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value is appropriately updated when encountering spaces or tabs in the prefix string. Additionally, the comparison between `current_column` and the specified `column` parameter needs to be accurate to handle the correct indentation level for the comment.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines, the corrected function should now correctly handle the indentation and splitting of the prefix string. This adjustment should address the issue identified in the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
