### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the given prefix based on a specified column. The function iterates over each character in the prefix, accumulating characters in `current_line` until a certain condition is met. This condition is to wait for a newline character (`'\n'`) once a specific column is reached.

### Issues
1. The calculation of the current column is incorrect when incrementing for spaces and tabs.
2. The logic to handle waiting for a newline character needs adjustment.
3. The return statement is incorrect, leading to unexpected outputs.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line (`'# comment'`) exceeding the specified column. It fails to handle this scenario correctly, resulting in an incorrect output with the comment misplaced or duplicated.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the column calculation logic to account for spaces and tabs properly.
2. Modify the logic for waiting for a newline to correctly handle exceeding the specified column.
3. Adjust the return statement to provide the desired output by considering the consumed lines correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust the column increment for tabs
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues identified and should now correctly handle the scenario where a comment exceeds the specified column.
