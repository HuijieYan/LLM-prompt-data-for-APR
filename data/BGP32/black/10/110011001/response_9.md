### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a given column value. The function iterates over the characters in the prefix, updating the `current_line` and `current_column` state variables accordingly. If a certain condition is met (reaching the desired column), the function is supposed to return a processed result along with the remaining unparsed part of the prefix.

The bug seems to originate from the handling of new lines (`\n`). When a new line character is encountered, the function should reset `current_column` if there is content on the current line and not enter the "wait_for_nl" state. However, the function incorrectly enters the "wait_for_nl" state in all cases of encountering a new line character.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles new lines and resets the `current_column`. We should only set `wait_for_nl` to `True` when encountering spaces or tabs. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic around when to add to the `lines` list and when to reset `current_line`. This should resolve the issue of incorrect handling of new lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now properly consume the prefix up to the specified column, handling new lines appropriately and providing correct output.
