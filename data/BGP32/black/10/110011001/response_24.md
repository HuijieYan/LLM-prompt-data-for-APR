### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached. However, based on the failing test and the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the function is not correctly handling cases where a comment is encountered before reaching the specified column. The issue appears to be related to how the function handles spaces and tabs when calculating the current column.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line or ends before the specified column is reached. This causes the function to incorrectly consume characters and fails to return the expected result.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the current column based on spaces, tabs, and new lines. Additionally, we need to handle cases where comments are encountered before reaching the specified column.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column += 1  # Increment for other characters
                if current_column >= column:
                    break
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditionals to correctly handle different characters and the column calculation, the corrected function should now correctly consume characters until the specified column is reached, including handling comments properly.
