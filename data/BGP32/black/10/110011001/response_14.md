### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix up to a specified column, keeping track of lines and columns while handling tabs, spaces, and newlines correctly. The function splits the prefix into lines based on the column requirement.
2. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) while waiting for a newline or at the beginning of a line. It fails to reset the current line and column values properly in such cases.
3. The cause of the bug is that when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline or at the beginning of a line, the function does not handle resetting the current line and column values correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current line and column values are correctly reset when encountering a newline character under the specified conditions.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the current line and column values appropriately when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly.
