### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. The function iterates through the characters in the prefix, accumulating them in `current_line`. When encountering specific characters like spaces, tabs, or newlines, it updates `current_column` accordingly. The function aims to return the consumed lines up to the specified column and the remaining prefix.

The error message indicates a failing test related to comment indentation. The test expects the function to correctly format the given contents for different indentation styles. The function fails to handle comments within the prefix correctly.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, when the comment starts with a '#', the condition for appending current_line to lines is not satisfied because `current_column` is not less than `column`. Hence, the comment is not included in the result.
2. In Case 5, as the function consumes the prefix, it incorrectly identifies spaces as characters to increment `current_column`, causing a shift in the actual consumed lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles counting characters, especially regarding spaces and tabs. Additionally, we need to ensure that comments are retained in the consumed lines. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition to include newline
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The correction includes:
- Adjusting conditions to correctly handle comments and track columns.
- Ensuring that comments are not missed when consuming the prefix.
