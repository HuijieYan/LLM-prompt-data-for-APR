### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles the cases where an indent is followed by a comment in the input `prefix`. The function incorrectly waits for a new line character (`'\n'`) to consider the comment as part of the current line. This behavior leads to incorrect indentation levels and missing comments in the output.

In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the input prefix `'\t# comment\n\t'` due to the same issue. It appends the comment to `current_line` instead of keeping it as a separate line. This incorrect behavior distorts the actual indentation and comment placement.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should not wait for a new line character to process a comment following an indent. Instead, it should consider the comment as part of the current line as long as there is no new indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By removing the condition that waits for a new line character after an indent, the corrected function processes comments correctly, preserving their position relative to the corresponding line.
