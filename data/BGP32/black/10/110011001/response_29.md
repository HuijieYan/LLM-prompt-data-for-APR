### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column width is reached. The function processes each character in the prefix string, accumulating characters into `current_line` until it encounters a new line (`\n`). However, there are issues with the logic inside the function that cause it to fail in certain cases.

### Issues
1. The function fails to properly handle comments (`'#'`) within the prefix, resulting in inconsistencies in the output.
2. In cases where the column width is not reached before encountering a new line, the function doesn't correctly update `current_column` and `wait_for_nl`, leading to incorrect results.
3. The function doesn't properly handle the case where the prefix string is entirely consumed before reaching the specified column width.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the issues in the function, we need to:
1. Ensure that comments within the prefix are handled correctly.
2. Update `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` appropriately to manage the column width condition.
3. Handle the case where the entire prefix is consumed before reaching the specified column.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the mentioned adjustments to the function, it should now correctly handle comments within the prefix, track the column width, and handle cases where the entire prefix is consumed before reaching the specified column.
