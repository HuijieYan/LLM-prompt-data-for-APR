The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume and partially process a prefix of characters until a specific column limit is reached. The function encounters problems related to correctly handling the newline characters and ensuring the correct handling of indentation. 

Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output values, we can see that the function is not preserving the correct indentations for comments. The function is failing to retain the proper indentation for comments and is causing the test to fail.

The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character within indentation. This triggers the reset of the current column count to 0, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newlines. The fix involves adjusting line handling logic to correctly handle indentation resets caused by newlines within the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic handling newlines to correctly maintain indentation levels while consuming the prefix.
