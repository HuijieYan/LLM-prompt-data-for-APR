### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value, preserving any indentations and halting at certain characters like spaces, tabs, or newlines. The function stores lines that have been fully consumed in the `lines` list and appends incomplete lines to `current_line`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the logic related to `wait_for_nl`. When encountering the indentation (space or tab) of a new line after reading a non-newline character, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True`. However, this logic is incorrectly implemented leading to not handling this transition correctly, ultimately resulting in misalignments in the returned output.

### Bug Location
The issue arises when the function parses newlines. It fails to reset `current_line` to an empty string when finishing a line, leading to incorrect handling of subsequent characters and indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. When encountering a newline character, reset `current_line` to an empty string to prevent carrying over characters from the previous line.
2. Ensure that `current_column` gets reset appropriately when a newline character is found.
3. Update `wait_for_nl` logic to ensure that transitioning between lines is handled correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately upon encountering a newline character, this corrected version addresses the bug and should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column, preserving indentations.
