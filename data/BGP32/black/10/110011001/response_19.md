### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of lines and columns within the input prefix string. The function aims to consume and split a prefix string based on a given column. However, the logic inside the function is incorrect, leading to incorrect output, as observed in the failing test case.

#### Potential Error Location:
The main issue arises when the function encounters a newline character `\n` in the input prefix string. The logic for updating the current line, checking column position, and handling `\n` is flawed, leading to incorrect splitting of the prefix.

#### Bug Cause:
1. The logic does not correctly handle cases where there is whitespace (spaces or tabs) before the new line character.
2. The condition to reset the column count and append the current line to the list of lines is incorrect, leading to an erroneous split.
3. The condition `wait_for_nl` is not properly updated for cases after encountering tabs.
4. The handling of characters other than spaces, tabs, and newlines is inconsistent, leading to errors in determining the indentation level.

#### Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain proper tracking of the column count considering spaces and tabs equally.
2. Update the logic for handling newlines to ensure correct splitting.
3. Fix the condition for updating the `wait_for_nl` variable to maintain the correct state.
4. Improve the handling of different characters to accurately identify indentation completion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the prefix string based on the given column, pass the failing test cases, and provide the expected output.
