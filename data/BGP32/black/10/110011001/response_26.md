### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. The bug arises when handling the case where a comment symbol `#` is encountered. It incorrectly interprets the comment as part of the indentation, leading to incorrect prefix processing.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located within the `elif char == ' ':` condition block where the current column count is incremented for spaces. Comments should not be included in the column count.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the current column count to include spaces that are part of comments, leading to incorrect calculation and processing of the prefix when encountering comments.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment symbol `#` is encountered, the function does not increment the column count. Comments should not affect the current column calculations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes a new condition `elif char == '#'` to handle comments separately and avoid incrementing the column count when encountering comments. Now the function should correctly process the prefix string according to the given column value and handle comments appropriately.
