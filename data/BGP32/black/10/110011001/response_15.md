### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error in handling indentation levels. It fails to correctly handle indentation after encountering a newline character. This results in incorrect indentation when reconstructing the line. The function does not properly reset the `current_line` and `current_column` after encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the indentation level and line construction after encountering a newline character. Specifically, we need to reset `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately to reflect the correct indentation level of the next line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                # Reset line and column for new indentation level
                if char != '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    # Handling cases for tab indentation
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_line = ' ' * current_column
                    elif char == '\t':
                        current_line = '\t' * (current_column // 4)
                    current_column = 0
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to properly reset `current_line` and `current_column` after encountering a newline character, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and reconstruct the line with the correct formatting.
