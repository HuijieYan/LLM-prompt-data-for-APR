### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given prefix string until a specific column is reached. However, there is an issue in the logic where it fails to properly handle cases where there is a comment in the prefix that needs to be skipped. The logic to handle skipping the comment and stopping at the specified column is faulty.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the handling of comments within the `prefix` string. When a comment is encountered, the function incorrectly interprets it and continues appending characters while not properly calculating the indentation level. This leads to incorrect comparisons and results in the function returning the wrong output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around how comments are handled. Specifically, when a comment symbol is encountered, the function should skip that part of the string while properly tracking the current indentation level and column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Handle comments: skip to end of line
            while char != '\n' and prefix:
                char = prefix[0]
                prefix = prefix[1:]
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue by properly handling comments and adjusting the indentation logic accordingly. By skipping comments while tracking the current column, the function can correctly determine where to stop processing the `prefix` string.
