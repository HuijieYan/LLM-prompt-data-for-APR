### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the fact that it incorrectly handles the indentation. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the function should reset the `current_column` to 0. However, in the current implementation, it does not reset the `current_column` when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect indentation tracking.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the function encounters a newline character, it correctly resets the `current_column` to 0. This adjustment will allow the function to accurately track the indentation level and hence properly consume the prefix.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column when encountering a newline
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, we ensure that the function properly resets the indentation level and correctly consumes the prefix. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
