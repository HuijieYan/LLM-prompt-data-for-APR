### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect indentation processing when encountering a comment. The function is designed to handle indentation levels based on spaces and tabs, but it fails to handle indentation levels correctly when encountering a comment line. This causes the function to incorrectly strip away the comment, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

The specific issue occurs in the logic around comment handling within the function. When the function encounters a comment line, it incorrectly restarts the current line, which results in losing the comment as part of the line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of how the function handles comment lines. Instead of restarting the current line when encountering a comment, the function should process the comment line in the correct context regarding the indentation levels specified by spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if not current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version now correctly handles the processing of comment lines within the prefix indentation context. By ensuring that comment lines are correctly included in the output, the function should pass the failing test scenario.
