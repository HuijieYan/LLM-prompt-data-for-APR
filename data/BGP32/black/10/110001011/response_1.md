### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on the provided column value.
2. The function seems to have issues with handling cases where there are tabs or spaces mixed in the prefix string.
3. The function should correctly handle the indentation levels of the lines in the prefix and stop consuming when the column is reached.
4. The GitHub issue is related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent, which could be a result of the buggy behavior of the function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not handle tabs and spaces consistently in calculating the current column position. This results in incorrect behavior when encountering tab characters, leading to misalignment of the consumed lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the handling of tabs and spaces to ensure that the current column is calculated accurately.
2. Adjust the logic for consuming the prefix to correctly handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tab length
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column >= column:  # Check if column reached
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':  # Detect end of indentation
                    wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line and current_column < column:
        lines.append(current_line)
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With these updates, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column value, handling both spaces and tabs appropriately. This should address the reported issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
