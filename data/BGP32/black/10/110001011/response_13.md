## Analyzing the buggy function and the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. The function seems to have some logic issues related to handling newline characters and indentation levels.

The GitHub issue describes a problem related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent when using the `black` library. This issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation levels in the code, which might be a result of the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling the indentation level in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is faulty, especially regarding tabs and spaces.
2. Incorrect processing of newline characters and their effect on the current column position.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is likely due to the erroneous handling of indentation levels and newline characters in the function, leading to incorrect results when consuming prefixes with varying indentation levels.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, it's essential to properly handle tab characters, spaces, and newline characters to accurately determine the consumed prefix part. Adjustments should be made to correctly maintain the proper indentation level during consumption.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if not wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function aims to address the issues related to indentation levels and newline characters, providing a more accurate consumption of the prefix string.
