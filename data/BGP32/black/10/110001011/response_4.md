### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It processes characters in the prefix string to determine the correct indentation level. However, the function has a bug where it does not handle indentation correctly for tab characters, leading to incorrect behavior in the presence of tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) does not align the `current_column` correctly.
2. The logic for waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) is not properly coordinated with tab characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect calculation of the indentation level when encountering tab characters (`\t`). The function increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, which is inconsistent with the standard tab width. This leads to incorrect indentations when tabs are present in the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the way tab characters are processed to consider the actual tab width.
2. Ensure that the logic for waiting for a new line is correctly synchronized when encountering tab characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust to actual tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab character processing to reflect the actual tab width (typically 4 spaces), the corrected version of the function should now handle indentation correctly, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
