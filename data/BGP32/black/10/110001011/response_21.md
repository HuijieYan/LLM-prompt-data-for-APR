### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on the provided column value. The function processes each character from the prefix string, updating the current line, column, and waiting for a newline character if necessary.

### Identified Issue:
The bug arises in the condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`. When a newline character is encountered, the function should check if the current line is non-empty and if the current column is less than the input column. If the conditions are met, the function should construct the result string and return the remaining prefix. However, the current implementation of the function is not handling this scenario correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The issue in the current implementation is that the substring extraction logic and the comparison against the input column are incorrect. This causes the function to return incorrect values and leads to the incorrect behavior identified in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic inside the `if wait_for_nl` block to properly construct the result string and return the correct remaining prefix.
2. Ensure that the comparison between the current column and the input column is accurate to handle the prefix substring extraction correctly.
3. Adjust the handling of the current line and column to align with the desired functionality specified in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the function incorporates the necessary modifications to correctly handle the extraction of the prefix substring based on the input column value. By adjusting the logic in the `if wait_for_nl` block and ensuring the correct construction of the result string, the function now properly processes the prefix string as intended.
