## Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a prefix string character by character, keeping track of the current line, column, and indentation level.
2. The function incorrectly handles tab characters (`'\t'`) for indentation calculation, leading to issues with preserving the correct indentation level.
3. The bug is caused by incorrect handling of tab characters when calculating the current column, leading to incorrect indentation levels.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters to correctly update the current column based on the tab width (assumed to be 4 spaces).
5. The corrected version of the function will address the improper handling of tabs and ensure correct indentation levels are maintained.

## Bug Fix:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):
    # Corrected function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                tab_width = 4
                current_line += ' ' * (tab_width - current_column % tab_width)
                current_column += tab_width - current_column % tab_width
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function includes a proper handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) to accurately update the current column based on the assumed tab width of 4 spaces. This adjustment ensures that the function maintains the correct indentation levels, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
