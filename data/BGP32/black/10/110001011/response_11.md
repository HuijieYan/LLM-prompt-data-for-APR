### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a prefix string based on the given column value. It iterates through each character in the prefix string, updating the current line, current column, and checking for specific characters like spaces, tabs, and newline characters to determine the indentation level.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters (\t) in calculating the current column value.
2. Inconsistent handling of newlines (\n) leading to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug most likely stems from the improper calculation of the current column based on tab characters (\t). The function is not correctly updating the column count when encountering tab characters, leading to incorrect indentation levels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic for calculating the column value when encountering tab characters to ensure the correct indentation.
2. Refine the handling of newline characters to maintain consistent behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4  # Assume tab width is 4 spaces
                else:
                    if not wait_for_nl:
                        wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters (\t) to increment the current column value by 4 spaces, assuming a tab width of 4 spaces. It also refines the logic for newline characters to ensure the expected behavior when consuming the prefix string based on the provided column value.
