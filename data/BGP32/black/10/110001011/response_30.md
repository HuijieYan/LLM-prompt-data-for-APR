### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation and newlines within the given prefix input. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix string until reaching a certain column, but based on the runtime values and types provided, it is not functioning correctly.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for `wait_for_nl` and the subsequent handling of newlines might be causing issues.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` based on different characters such as spaces, tabs, and newline characters could be incorrect.
3. Building `current_line` and appending it to `lines` may not be correctly considering the intended column restrictions.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the runtime values and types, the function fails to handle cases where comment lines are tab-indented and do not align with the expected column. This results in incorrect behavior as discussed in the GitHub issue, where indentation is changed wrongly after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic related to tracking columns and lines to properly handle tab characters.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the intended indentations by considering the given column parameter.
3. Ensure that newlines within the prefix are handled appropriately, especially in cases where the comment lines have tab indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the tab increment based on the desired column
            current_column += 4 if column % 4 else column
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
By updating and refining the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab indentation, newlines, and column alignment, the bug identified in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation after a dedent operation can be addressed effectively.
