### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a prefix string and partially consuming it until a specific column is reached. It handles characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines to determine the point at which to stop consuming the prefix.
2. The bug seems to occur when handling indentation for comments, specifically after a dedent operation.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of indentation levels within the string when encountering tabs or spaces.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the column position after each character and handles tabs or spaces accordingly to maintain correct indentation levels.
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tabs to increment the column position correctly to address the issue of incorrect indentation levels after a dedent operation.
