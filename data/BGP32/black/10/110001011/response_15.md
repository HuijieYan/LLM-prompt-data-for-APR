### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is trying to process a prefix string by incrementing the current column according to spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of tabs as they are mistakenly adding 4 to the `current_column` instead of only 1.
3. The bug causes incorrect calculation of the `current_column`, leading to improper prefix consumption and incorrect indentations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic for handling tabs so that they only increase the `current_column` by 1.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 1  # Fix: Increase by 1 instead of 4 for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of tabs to increment the `current_column` by only 1, the function will now consume the prefix correctly and provide the expected indentation.
