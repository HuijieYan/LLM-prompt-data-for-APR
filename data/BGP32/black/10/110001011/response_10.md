### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column while handling spaces, tabs, and line breaks. However, based on the runtime values provided, there are several issues:
1. In Case 1, the function does not correctly handle the scenario where the last line of the prefix does not end with a line break, causing it to miss appending the current line to `lines`.
2. In Case 3, the handling of tab characters for indentation calculation is incorrect, potentially leading to inaccurate column counts.
3. There might be an issue in correctly updating the `current_column` and resetting the variables for a new line.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be primarily caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters for indentation calculation and the handling of line breaks for the last line in the prefix string. These issues lead to incorrect column tracking and line splitting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that:
1. Tab characters are correctly accounted for in column tracking.
2. Proper handling of line breaks, especially for the last line in the prefix string.
3. The logic for updating `current_column` and resetting variables is accurate.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += ' '  # Add a space character
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                spaces_to_add = 4 - (current_column % 4)
                current_line += ' ' * spaces_to_add  # Convert tab to space characters
                current_column += spaces_to_add
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the issues with tab character handling, line break detection, and proper column tracking. By accurately converting tab characters to spaces and handling line breaks correctly, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.
