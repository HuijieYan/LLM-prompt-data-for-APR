### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process the given prefix string until a specified column width is reached or a newline character is encountered. However, based on the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables, we can see that there are some issues with the logic. The cases provided highlight scenarios where the function fails to correctly handle tab characters, spaces, and newline characters in the prefix string.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) is incorrect. The function is incrementing `current_column` by 4 for each tab character encountered, which is not the correct behavior.
2. The logic that checks for non-space characters to determine when to wait for a newline is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering mixtures of spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is mainly caused by incorrect handling of tab characters and mixing the logic for calculating columns and waiting for newline. This leads to incorrect indentation and processing of the prefix string, resulting in incorrect outputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the column calculation to correctly handle tab characters by updating the increment based on the encountered character.
2. Separate the logic for calculating columns and waiting for newline characters to ensure correct processing of the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust for tab size
        else:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the tab character handling and separates the logic for waiting for a newline. Adjustments are made to correctly compute the column and update the current line based on the encountered characters.
