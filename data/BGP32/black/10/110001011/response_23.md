### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is intended to consume part of the prefix text up to a certain column limit.
2. The function tracks the current line, column position, and waits for a new line character to change the line or indentation level.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling tabs and spaces when calculating the indentation level.
4. The bug causes incorrect indentation levels when processing text with a mix of tabs and spaces.
5. The bug is in line with the GitHub issue related to incorrect behavior with tabs in the indentation of comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of tab characters (`\t`) when calculating the column position. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, which leads to incorrect calculation of the indentation level.

### Fix Strategy:
Adjust the logic to correctly handle tab characters and ensure that the function accurately calculates the level of indentation based on the mix of tabs and spaces in the input text.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':  # Handle space character
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # Handle tab character
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tab characters has been modified to ensure that the column position accurately reflects the indentation level regardless of the mix of tabs and spaces in the input text. This adjustment should resolve the indentation issue described in the GitHub problem.
