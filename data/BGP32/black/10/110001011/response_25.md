### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is designed to consume a prefix while keeping track of the current line and column position.
2. The function fails to correctly handle cases when encountering a newline character `'\n'` while waiting for indentation to finish.
3. The bug leads to incorrect behavior in handling indentation and empty lines, causing issues with comments and indentations in the code.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters and manages indentation levels appropriately.
5. The corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from improper handling of newline characters when the function is waiting for indentation to finish. This causes incorrect behaviors in handling comments and indentations, leading to the reported issue on GitHub.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function logic to correctly handle newline characters when waiting for the indentation to finish.
2. Adjust the logic to maintain the correct indentation level for comments.
3. Ensure that empty lines are handled consistently to prevent unexpected behavior.
4. Refactor the function to improve readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the function to handle newline characters effectively and manage indentation levels properly, the corrected version should now address the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
