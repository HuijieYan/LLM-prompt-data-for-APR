### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the given column value. The function keeps track of the current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle indentation and new lines. However, there are inconsistencies in handling spaces, tabs, and new lines causing incorrect behavior.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of characters in the input prefix string.
2. Inconsistencies in updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flag.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the mismanagement of indentation levels when encountering spaces, tabs, and new lines within the prefix string. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation and new lines, deviating from the intended behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper tracking of the `current_column` based on spaces and tabs.
2. Update the `wait_for_nl` flag appropriately to handle new lines.
3. Make sure the logic for storing processed lines is consistent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug related to incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines should be resolved. This addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
