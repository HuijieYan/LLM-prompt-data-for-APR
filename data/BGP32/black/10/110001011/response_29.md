### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle partially consuming a prefix string based on a given column indentation. The function seeks to split the prefix into two parts: one part that maintains the indentation up to the specified column, and another part that exceeds the column indentation.

### Identified potential errors:
1. The condition `char == '\n'` only resets `current_column` to 0 and does not handle additional logic to maintain indentation properly.
2. The logic sequence for checking character types and updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags may not work effectively.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of newline characters causing an incorrect adjustment of the current indentation level after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect indentation in the output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that after encountering a newline character, the function handles the indentation correctly based on the current column count and maintains the correct indentation level as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)  # Add spaces to match column
                current_column = column
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the issues related to handling newline characters and maintaining correct indentation. It adjusts the current line's length with the necessary spaces to match the desired column when encountering a newline character within the specified column limit. Additionally, it correctly handles tab characters to ensure consistent indentation based on the column count.
