### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume the specified prefix until the specified column is reached in the input text. However, the current implementation has a bug where the comments' indentation is not handled correctly, especially when encountering tab characters.
2. The bug causes the function to misinterpret the indentation level when encountering tab characters in the prefix, leading to incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix text.
3. This bug is related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where the incorrect handling of tab characters in comments results in indentation issues.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation level based on spaces and tab characters to accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True  # Indent is finished

            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation:
I have modified the logic inside the loop to properly handle the indentation level based on spaces and tab characters. Now, the function will correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column and handle comments with tab characters as expected. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation behavior.
