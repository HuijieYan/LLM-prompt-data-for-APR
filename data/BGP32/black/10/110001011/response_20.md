### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a specific column number is reached or until a new line character is encountered. The main issue seems to be around the logic related to handling tab characters and proper indentation.

### Error locations:
1. Incorrect calculation of `current_column` when encountering a tab character.
2. Inadequate handling of new line characters causing incorrect indentations.
3. Inconsistent approach when tracking the lines.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises due to the mishandling of tab characters and improper adjustment of indentation levels causing the incorrect output, especially with comments and tabs mix. The improper logic for tab characters and newline characters results in discrepancies in calculating the actual column position.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly calculate the column position when encountering tab characters.
2. Ensure that new line characters reset the column position properly.
3. Maintain a consistent approach for tracking lines and column positions to avoid discrepancies.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                if current_column < column:
                    diff = column - current_column
                    current_line += ' ' * diff
                    current_column += diff
                    continue
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with tab characters, newline handling, and line tracking to ensure consistent and proper indentation. Now, the function should correctly consume the prefix until the specified column number giving the expected result as per the GitHub issue described.
