## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the logic for handling tabs `'\t'` is not correctly updating the value of `current_column`. This leads to incorrect indentation processing, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of tabs within the input prefix string.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to properly handle tabs `'\t'` where the column count needs to be increased by 1 for each tab character.
2. Ensure that the column count reflects the correct indentation level when processing tabs.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
            
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tabs and ensuring the correct count for column spacing, the corrected version of the function should now address the bug related to the incorrect processing of indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
