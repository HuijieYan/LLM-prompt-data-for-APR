### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of a string up to a certain column limit. However, there is a bug in handling the indentation levels when encountering tab characters. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` while processing tab characters, leading to incorrect column tracking, especially when dealing with tabulated comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of tab characters in the input prefix. When encountering a tab, the function should increase the `current_column` by 4 (as defined), but it incorrectly increments it by 1. This miscalculation affects the accurate tracking of the column position and results in the improper handling of tabulated comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code section responsible for handling tab characters to increment the `current_column` by 4 instead of 1.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Fix: Increment current_column by 4 for each tab
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment to correctly handle tab characters by incrementing the `current_column` by 4, the function should now be able to accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column limit while maintaining the correct indentation levels for comments and code.
