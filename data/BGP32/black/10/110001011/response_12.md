### 1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until it reaches a certain column in a line of code. However, based on the input and output values provided, there are discrepancies in the function's behavior. The function seems to have issues handling newline characters and correctly updating the column count.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect condition for dealing with newline characters.
2. Inaccurate updating of the `current_column` variable.
3. Mismanagement of `wait_for_nl` flag.

### 3. Bug Cause:
From the provided runtime values, the function fails to handle newline characters accurately. In Case 1, when the input prefix contains `'\n'`, it does not properly handle the line breaks and indentation, leading to incorrect results. This mismanagement of newline characters causes the function to return incorrect values, especially when encountering newline characters within the prefix.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle newline characters, update the `current_column` variable accurately, and manage the `wait_for_nl` flag effectively. By adjusting the logic related to newline characters and indentation, the function can align with the expected behavior, resolving the bug.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column >= column:
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), current_line

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the newline character handling, updates the `current_column` correctly, and improves the management of the `wait_for_nl` flag. By making these adjustments, the function should now behave as intended and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes.
