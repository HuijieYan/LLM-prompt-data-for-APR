### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition where `if wait_for_nl:` is not triggering when it should.
2. The indentation calculation logic in the `elif char == '\t':` block might be incorrect.
3. The logic for updating `current_line` and `current_column` based on the characters in `prefix` might be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation when encountering tabs in comments after dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` condition triggers correctly when needed.
2. Adjust the logic for updating `current_column` when encountering tab characters.
3. Revise the logic for updating `current_line` and `current_column` to accommodate tabs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl or char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update based on the tab width
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with incorrect indentation handling, especially in scenarios involving tabs in comments after dedent. It ensures that the indentation is preserved correctly during partial consumption of the prefix.
