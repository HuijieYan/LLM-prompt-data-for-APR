### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to process a prefix string based on indentation levels and the provided column. It identifies empty lines, spaces, tabs, and newline characters to ensure correct processing of the prefix. However, based on the provided runtime values and output values, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the cases involving tabs and spaces.

### Identified Issue:
The main issue lies in how the function updates the `current_column` value when encountering tabs or spaces. Since spaces and tabs are not handled consistently regarding their effect on the column value, this leads to incorrect calculations of indentation levels and results in improper processing of the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, it's essential to ensure that both spaces and tabs are treated consistently in updating the `current_column` value. Specifically, tabs should be considered equivalent to four spaces in terms of increasing the column count.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of spaces and tabs for updating the `current_column` value. It addresses the bug related to incorrect indentation processing, especially in cases involving tabs and spaces.
