### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specific column value. It parses each character of the prefix to determine when to stop and return the consumed part along with the remaining part. The bug occurs when handling tab characters within the prefix, leading to incorrect indentations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function fails to recognize the newline character following the comment line, resulting in an incorrect indentation level.
2. In Case 3, the function misinterprets the tab character, leading to incorrect indentation and line splitting.
3. The function does not handle tab characters appropriately when calculating the column position.
4. The logic for detecting when to wait for a newline character (`wait_for_nl`) is flawed, resulting in premature line breaks and incorrect indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the column calculation logic to correctly handle both spaces and tab characters.
2. Adjust the `wait_for_nl` condition to trigger only after the correct indentation has been determined.
3. Properly handle tab characters when calculating the column position for correct indentation.
4. Ensure that the function correctly recognizes newline characters to avoid premature line breaks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if current_column < column:
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the function to properly handle tab characters, calculate column positions accurately, and adjust the newline detection condition, the corrected version should now address the indentation-related bug reported in the GitHub issue.
