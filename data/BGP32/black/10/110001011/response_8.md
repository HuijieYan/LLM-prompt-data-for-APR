### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is intended to partially consume the input `prefix` string based on a given `column` value.
- The function tracks the current line, column, and waiting for a newline character to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.
- The bug seems to be related to handling whitespace characters, tabs, newlines, and the logic to determine when to stop consumption.
- The issue described on GitHub is related to indentation being incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent, which might be caused by how the function handles tabs and newlines.
- The function needs a revision to handle these cases correctly and avoid changing indentation improperly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character (`\t`) and incorrectly increments the `current_column` by a fixed value of 4, instead of adjusting it relative to the previous column position.
- This incorrect column handling leads to misalignments in the prefix consumed, resulting in wrong indentation, which aligns with the issue reported on GitHub.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic related to handling tab characters to adjust the `current_column` based on the previous column position and make sure to account for different whitespace characters properly.
- Check the conditions for when to stop consuming and properly handle the cases of tabs, spaces, and newlines to maintain correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
- Adjusted the computation for `current_column` when encountering a tab character to calculate the correct increment based on the current position modulo 4.
- Improved the conditions and flow control for handling different types of whitespace characters to ensure proper consumption of the prefix.
- This corrected version aims to fix the incorrect prefix consumption and address the issue of improper indentation changes reported on GitHub.
