### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume prefix characters until a certain column is reached. However, it has a bug in handling the case where indentation is finished and a newline character is encountered.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `elif char == '\n':` might not correctly reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. The logic to handle when the indent is finished and waiting for a newline `elif char == '\n':` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
For the given cases, the bug occurs when encountering a newline character after finishing the indentation. In such cases, the `current_column` is not reset to 0, leading to incorrect handling of subsequent characters based on the column.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered after finishing the indentation, the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0. Additionally, the logic for handling when the indent is finished and waiting for a newline needs to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    
                    # Reset current_column to 0 after encountering newline
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                # Skip waiting for newline if encountered directly
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the `current_column` is properly reset to 0 when encountering a newline character. Additionally, the logic for handling when the indent is finished and waiting for a newline has been adjusted to handle the cases correctly. This should resolve the indentation issue as reported in the GitHub bug.
