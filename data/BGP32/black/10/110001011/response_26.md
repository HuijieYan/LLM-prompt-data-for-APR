### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume an input prefix character by character until a specified column value is reached. However, it fails to handle cases where tab characters are present in the prefix correctly. The function tracks the current line, current column position, and waits for a newline before resetting the tracking. It struggles with tab characters due to incorrect handling of column calculations.

### 2. Identified Error Locations
The main issue lies in the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tab characters. The `current_column` is incorrectly increased by a fixed value of 4 instead of properly taking into account the current indentation level.

### 3. Bug Cause
In cases where tabs are present in the prefix, the function does not calculate the `current_column` properly, resulting in incorrect column positions. This causes unexpected behavior when encountering comments as stated in the GitHub issue.

### 4. Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tab characters when calculating the `current_column`. Instead of having a fixed increment for tabs, the function should consider the existing column position and adjust accordingly based on the tab character's position.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':  # Adjust column for tab character
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version now properly adjusts the `current_column` when encountering tab characters, ensuring correct tracking of the column position even with mixed tabs and spaces. This adjustment addresses the root cause of the bug and aligns the function with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
