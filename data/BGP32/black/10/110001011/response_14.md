## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle indentation and strip it when a specific rule is met. The issue seems to stem from the handling of tabs and spaces interchangeably, which is causing incorrect behavior when consuming prefixes with mixed tab and space indentation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of indentation in the presence of tabs and spaces.
2. Inconsistent usage of `current_column` for maintaining indentation levels.
3. Incorrectly distinguishing between leading spaces and tab characters.
4. The logic for updating `current_column` based on different characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function fails to differentiate between tab and space characters when updating the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with mixed indentation styles. This bug becomes evident when handling prefixes that involve tabs and spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are handled consistently when updating the current column for indentation tracking. We should differentiate between spaces and tabs, adjusting the indentation level accurately for mixed indentation styles.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) - len(current_line) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `len(current_line.expandtabs()) - len(current_line)` to calculate the effective column number while considering both tabs and spaces.
- Ensure consistent handling of tabs and spaces when updating the indentation level.
- The correction allows for proper consumption of prefixes with mixed tab and space indentation styles.
