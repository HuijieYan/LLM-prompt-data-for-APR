### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given prefix string based on specific column indentation. It reads each character of the prefix string and constructs lines based on newlines, spaces, tabs, and column positions. The function has multiple conditions to handle indentation levels and detect line endings.

### Identifying potential errors:
1. The condition to check for `wait_for_nl` and newline characters is not properly handling the logic related to column positions and ending lines.
2. The logic for rebuilding the lines list based on column positions is causing incorrect behavior for partially consumed prefixes.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines when processing prefixes. If the prefix contains a comment or spaces beyond the expected column position, the function fails to correctly align the lines.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to column positions, newline characters, and rebuilding lines. Ensuring that the function properly tracks the current column position and handles newlines will help resolve the issue.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, we updated the logic for handling newlines within the prefix. If the current column position is below the expected column, we return the constructed lines. This modification ensures correct processing of prefixes with comments or spaces beyond the specified column.
