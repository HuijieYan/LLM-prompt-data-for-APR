### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for processing a given prefix string character by character while considering indentation levels, whitespace characters, and newlines. The function seems to have an issue with handling the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function fails to preserve the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent because it does not correctly handle the case where a comment follows an indent that is not a multiple of 4 spaces. This results in the incorrect processing of indentation levels, leading to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels for comments following dedents that are not aligned with 4 spaces. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a newline after an indent.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the calculation for the number of spaces to add for each tab character and correctly updating the current column after dedents, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments following dedents. This corrected version addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
