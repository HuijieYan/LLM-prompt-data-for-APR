### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class has a method `_partially_consume_prefix` that is responsible for consuming a given prefix string until a certain column is reached.
2. The method keeps track of the lines being formed, the current line being constructed, the current column position, and whether to wait for a new line character.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels, especially with tabs and spaces mix.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` indicates issues with comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly handle the indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation.
2. In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the input lines with tabs and spaces mix are not correctly processed, leading to incorrect indentation.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent, especially when the input file uses tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks the indentation levels when processing the lines.
2. The handling of tabs and spaces mix should be adjusted to maintain correct indentation for comments.
3. It would be helpful to refactor the function to improve readability and simplify the logic for handling different indentation scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust column increment for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column increment for tabs to be 4 spaces in the corrected version, we can ensure correct handling of tabulated comments and resolve the bug. This adjusted version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
