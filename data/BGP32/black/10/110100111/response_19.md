### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a prefix string based on the provided column number for indentation.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix and adjusts the current line, current column, and other flags accordingly to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation spaces and tabs along with newlines, causing incorrect behavior when extracting lines.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the given indentation column.
5. The GitHub issue indicates that there is an incorrect indentation change for tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the behavior observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to occur due to inconsistent handling of tab characters and spaces for indentation levels, leading to incorrect behavior when extracting lines. This inconsistency arises when transitioning between different types of indentation characters (tabs and spaces) and may result in misalignment of comments as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of both tab and space characters for calculating the correct indentation level. Additionally, the logic to detect the end of an indentation block and properly extract lines needs to be adjusted for accurate results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust the tab width to 4 spaces for consistency
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections, the bug related to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent should be resolved. The corrected function ensures consistent handling of different types of indentation characters and accurately extracts the lines based on the given column.
