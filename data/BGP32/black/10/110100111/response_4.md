### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a prefix string until a specific column is reached, handling indentation levels based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The function seems to have an issue in correctly identifying the expected column indentation after a dedent.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` aims to test the function's behavior with various indentation scenarios involving comments. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a specific problem related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
4. To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the comment indentation remains consistent with the code lines even after dedent operations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation, especially when tabs are used for indentation. The function fails to handle this scenario properly, leading to inconsistent output compared to the expected result in the test cases and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle comment indentation after dedent operations. This can be achieved by ensuring that the comment indentation aligns with the current line's indentation level, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 8) + 1) * 8  # Adjust for 8 character tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # newline encountered, reset column count
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indenting content, wait for newline
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the modification above to handle tabs and spaces properly during the tracking of the current column, we aim to address the issue of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
