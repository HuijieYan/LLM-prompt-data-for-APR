### Analysis
1. The `Driver` class contains a method `_partially_consume_prefix` which is supposed to handle partially consuming a given prefix based on indentation rules.
2. The function tracks lines, current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` which indicates whether a new line is expected after a certain condition is met.
3. The buggy function fails to correctly handle indentation levels and fails to adjust comment indentation properly.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks for correct comment indentation after dedent operation.
5. The issue on GitHub reports that the library changes comment indentation incorrectly after a dedent operation when tabs are used instead of spaces.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle tab characters and does not accurately track the column position after an indent or dedent operation. This leads to incorrect handling of comment indentation when tabs are used instead of spaces, resulting in the observed behavior in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the column position based on the number of spaces for each tab character encountered. Also, we should check the correct indent/dedent behavior to ensure proper handling of comment indentation after dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust column position for tab
        else:
            current_column += 1
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By accurately adjusting the column position for tab characters, the corrected function should handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
