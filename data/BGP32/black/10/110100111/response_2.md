### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix string based on certain conditions related to indentation.
2. The function tracks the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line. It iterates over the characters in the prefix string and adjusts the column and line accordingly.
3. The bug seems to occur when there are tabs in the prefix string and it fails to maintain the correct indentation.
4. The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
5. The function needs to properly handle the indentation changes for tab characters in the prefix string to fix the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails to correctly handle tab characters in the prefix string leading to incorrect indentation adjustments.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of tab characters by converting them to spaces based on the indent size (possibly 4 spaces per tab).
2. Adjust the column count accordingly when encountering tab characters to maintain consistent indentation.
3. Update the logic to correctly track the current line and column based on the characters in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        indent_size = 4  # Assuming tab size equivalent to 4 spaces

        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += (indent_size - current_column % indent_size)
                current_line += ' ' * (indent_size - current_column % indent_size)
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the tab size into the logic for handling character-based indentation updates, the corrected version of the function should now properly maintain consistent indentation levels, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
