### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class that partially consumes a prefix string based on specified column and indentation rules.
2. The function initializes variables to track lines, current line content, current column position, and flag for waiting for new line.
3. It iterates over the characters in the prefix string, updating the current line content and column position accordingly based on indentation rules.
4. If a new line character is encountered and certain conditions are met, it appends the current line to the `lines` list and resets relevant variables.
5. The function then returns the consumed lines and the remaining prefix after all characters have been processed.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is related to the handling of indentation levels for comments. When processing prefixes with tabs for comments, the indentation level is not adjusted correctly after dedents, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, modification is needed in the logic that determines the indentation level of comments after dedents. Proper handling of tabs and spaces should be implemented to ensure correct formatting, especially for comments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted to accommodate tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column on new line to handle indentation correctly
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # Indent for comments considering tab and space mix
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function incorporates properly handling tab and space indentation for comments after dedents, ensuring the correct formatting behavior is applied.
