### Steps to fix the bug:
1. Analyzing the code, the bug seems to occur when the function encounters an empty line while iterating through the prefix, leading to an incorrect handling of the indentation of comments.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is set when a non-space/tab character is encountered, indicating that the function should wait for a newline character before processing the current line. However, if a newline character is encountered before the flag is set, it fails to correctly update the current line and column.
3. This bug leads to incorrect handling of indentation when managing comments after dedent.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around handling newline characters and properly update the current line and column when necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif char == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic of the function to handle newline characters properly, this corrected version should fix the bug and pass all the test cases provided.
