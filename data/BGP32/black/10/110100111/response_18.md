### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the prefix string and adjusting the indentation based on certain rules like spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments, especially after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect output.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates the issue by comparing the expected output with the actual output, highlighting the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to correctly handle the indentation for comments and ensure it aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue details.
5. The corrected version of the function should address the indentation issue for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect indentation of comments in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic inside `_partially_consume_prefix` function to accurately handle tabulated comments after dedent.
2. Ensure that the indentation for comments aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue descriptions.

### Corrected Function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue related to incorrect indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent operation should be resolved. This version aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
