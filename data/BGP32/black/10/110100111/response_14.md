### Analysis:
The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent operation. The `partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for parsing prefixes in the driver class, and it seems to have a bug that leads to incorrect behavior when processing comments after a dedent. The function is supposed to track the current line's indentation level based on spaces and tabs, but it fails to do so correctly in certain cases.

### Error Location:
The primary error seems to occur when handling comment lines after a dedent operation. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset after encountering a newline character in the middle of a prefix, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Cause:
When analyzing the function and the failing test cases, the bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) during the processing of the prefix. In the given cases, after dedenting, the comment lines need to be aligned with the code, but due to incorrect handling in the function, the comment indentation is not adjusted properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly resets the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character. This will allow the function to accurately track the indentation level after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset wait_for_nl and current_column
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag and `current_column` variable when encountering a newline character, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation, resolving the reported issue.
