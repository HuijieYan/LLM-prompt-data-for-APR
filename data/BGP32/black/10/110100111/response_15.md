### Analysis
The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` function which is responsible for partially consuming the indentation prefix of a string. The function has logic to handle indentation levels and new lines, but it fails to correctly process tab characters and maintain the correct column count.

#### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect increment of `current_column` when encountering tab characters.
2. Mishandling of tab characters leading to incorrect indentation levels.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the bug manifests when the function encounters tab characters. The expected input/output values are not met due to the incorrect handling of tab characters leading to inconsistent indentation.

Within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the incorrect handling of tab characters causes the `current_column` count to be incremented incorrectly, leading to gaps in the expected indentation level. This discrepancy results in the issue described in the GitHub report where comments are wrongly indented after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic around handling tab characters. Correctly incrementing the `current_column` count based on tab characters and aligning the indentation levels will address the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly adjusting the `current_column` value when encountering tab characters and ensuring consistent indentation levels, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
