### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming part of the prefix based on the specified column value.
2. The function maintains variables such as `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to handle the prefix consumption process.
3. The bug causes incorrect behavior when processing tabs and comments, resulting in incorrect indentation.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the problem where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of tab characters in the prefix and comments in the code. This leads to improper indentation of comments after a dedent operation, causing the failing test case scenarios.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly track tab characters (`\t`) and accommodate for comments within the prefix. The function should properly handle the tab spaces and newline characters to maintain the correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Ensure correct handling of tabulated comments
                if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle tabulated comments correctly and adjusting the behavior for newline characters, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and address the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
