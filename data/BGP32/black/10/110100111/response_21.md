### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation in the provided prefix string.
2. The function keeps track of the current line being processed (`current_line`), the current column position (`current_column`), and whether it is waiting for a newline character (`wait_for_nl`).
3. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters, causing the comments to be misaligned after dedent.
4. The provided failing test cases focus on scenarios where comments are affected by the buggy behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` that fails to handle the proper alignment of comments after dedent. When encountering newlines or whitespace characters, the function does not properly adjust the column position for the comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling column positions after dedent and newline characters needs to be revised. Properly incrementing the column value based on the encountered characters will ensure correct alignment of comments.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)  # Adjust for comment alignment
            current_column = column
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version above includes adjustments to ensure proper comment alignment after dedent. It increments the column based on the encountered characters to maintain the correct indentation levels for comments.

The corrected function should address the alignment issue with comments after dedent as noted in the GitHub issue.
