### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that is responsible for consuming the given prefix and adjusting the indentation level.
2. The function iterates through each character in the prefix and adjusts the current line and column based on the character type.
3. The bug involves incorrect handling of indentation after a newline character.
4. The GitHub issue describes the problem with tabulated comments' indentation after a dedent operation.
5. The expected behavior is to maintain correct indentation for comments relative to the following line.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because it does not correctly handle the indentation level after encountering a newline character with respect to comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function maintains the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent operation, aligning them with the following line.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent operation, aligning them with the following line.
