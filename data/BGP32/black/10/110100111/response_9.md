### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to handle the partial consumption of a prefix string until a certain column is reached. It tracks the lines, current_line, current_column, and a flag wait_for_nl to determine when to stop processing characters.
2. The bug seems to stem from the condition that checks whether to wait for a newline character, which is not always correctly handled.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` is related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation, specifically when using tabs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comment lines are correctly handled after dedents, especially when dealing with tabs.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly handle the indentation and newline characters when processing the prefix string.
- In cases where tabs are used, the function does not handle the indentation properly, resulting in incorrect comment indentation after dedents.
- The `wait_for_nl` flag logic does not account for all scenarios where newline characters may occur.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the logic related to handling indentation and newline characters, especially when processing comments after dedents.
- Ensure that the function correctly handles tabs and spaces indentation while maintaining comment alignment.
- Modify the `wait_for_nl` flag logic to better handle both tabulated and spaced indentation scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the partial consumption of the prefix string and ensure consistent comment indentation after dedents, as required by the failing test case and the reported GitHub issue.
