After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can identify the following potential error locations:
1. The condition to check for whitespace characters is incorrect.
2. The handling of the wait_for_nl flag is causing indentation issues.
3. Returning the incorrect prefix from the function.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The buggy behavior results in incorrect indentation for comments following dedent operations.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle indentation levels based on tab characters, spaces, and newline characters while considering the comment indentation correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version properly handles whitespace characters, indentation levels for tabs, spaces, and newline characters, ensuring correct handling of comments following dedent operations.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
