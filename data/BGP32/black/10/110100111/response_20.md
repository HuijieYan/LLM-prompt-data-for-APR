### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation in a string based on certain conditions.
2. The function tracks the current line, column, and whether to wait for a newline character before proceeding with indentation.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation for comments that follow an indented block, especially when tabs are used in the input.
4. The function fails to correctly update the `current_column` when encountering tab characters which leads to incorrect indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of tab characters in the `current_column` calculation. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, instead of aligning it with the corresponding column position.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the logic for updating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters to ensure correct indentation alignment.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Align column with tab position
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for tab character handling in the `current_column`, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for comments following an indented block, as expected according to the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.
