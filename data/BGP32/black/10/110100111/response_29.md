### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation and line breaking based on a given prefix and column value.
2. The function has issues with correctly handling indentation levels and spacing, leading to incorrect results.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if comments are correctly indented after dedents, which the function currently fails to handle.
4. The expected input/output values are provided for multiple cases, focusing on different scenarios of prefix, column, and indentation handling.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem related to indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Identified Errors:
1. Incorrect handling of characters and their corresponding effects on indentation levels.
2. Inconsistent update of variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.
3. Failure to account for various scenarios related to space, tabs, and newlines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the function's flawed logic in tracking and adjusting the indentation levels correctly based on different characters encountered in the prefix. This causes misalignment of comments after dedent operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure accurate tracking of the current indentation level and characters being processed.
2. Correctly handle special characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines to maintain the expected indentation structure.
3. Update variables consistently to reflect the progress in processing the prefix string.
4. Implement a clear logic flow for handling different scenarios of indentation and line breaks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line+'\n')
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the identified issues by ensuring proper handling of character types, indentation levels, and line breaks. It should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and produce the expected output values for the provided scenarios.
