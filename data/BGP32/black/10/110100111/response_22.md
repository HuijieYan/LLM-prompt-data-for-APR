1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on indentation levels. It iterates over each character in the prefix, tracks the current line, current column, and looks for newlines, tabs, and spaces to determine the correct indentation level. The function seems to have a bug when handling indentation levels and newline characters, especially for comments.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function could be the logic related to `wait_for_nl`, handling newline characters, and correctly updating the indentation level.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the incorrect handling of newlines and indentation levels within the function. This leads to incorrect indentation levels for comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function fails to maintain the correct column position when encountering newlines or tabs, leading to misaligned comments.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column position after each character, especially when encountering newline characters. Proper handling of indentations for different scenarios (such as tabs, spaces) is crucial to maintain the correct formatting of comments after a dedent.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, I have made changes to properly handle newline characters, update the current column position, and maintain correct indentation levels for comments. This should address the reported issue and align the comments correctly after a dedent, especially when using tabs.
