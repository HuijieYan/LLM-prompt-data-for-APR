### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming the prefix according to certain conditions related to indentation, white spaces, and newlines. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent operation. This issue impacts the correct formatting of code when using tabs for indentation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Logic related to `wait_for_nl` and handling of characters.
2. `current_column` calculation for spaces and tabs.
3. Check for when to append `current_line` to `lines`.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test scenario provided, when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent operation, the function messes up the handling of indentation levels. This leads to incorrect formatting of comments, which is not aligned properly with the code structure. The code provided in the failing test is not formatted correctly as expected due to this bug. This discrepancy in formatting is reported as a bug in the GitHub issue mentioned.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To address this bug, we need to ensure the correct handling of indentation levels, especially when dealing with tabulated comments following a dedent operation. The logic within the function needs to be modified to accurately maintain the indentation structure for comments. Additionally, improvements in tracking the current column position and line concatenation are essential for fixing this bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes to the function, we aim to adhere to the expected indentation structure and properly handle tabulated comments following dedent operations. This corrected version should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation of comments.
