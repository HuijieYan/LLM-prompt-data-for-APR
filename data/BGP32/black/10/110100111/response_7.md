### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, which processes a given `prefix` string based on indentation levels and column positions.
2. The method maintains `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables to keep track of indentation and new lines.
3. The bug occurs when `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`, and the code encounters a newline character. This results in an unexpected empty line and incorrect indentation processing.
4. The failing test case checks the indentation of a comment after a dedent operation, highlighting the tabulation issue.
5. To resolve this bug, we should correct the logic related to `wait_for_nl` and newline character handling.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of a newline character when `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`. This leads to unexpected empty lines, ultimately affecting the correct analysis of indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions related to newline character processing. Specifically, we should ensure that the logic to track and update indentation levels is consistent and aligned with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I adjusted the condition that checks for a newline character in `wait_for_nl` state to correctly handle indentation levels and avoid unexpected empty lines. This fix should address the bug and align the function with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.
