### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, considering different types of characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The function fails to handle the correct indentation for comments after a dedent, as described in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug occurs when encountering a newline character, causing unexpected behavior with respect to the indentation.
4. To fix the bug, a proper handling mechanism needs to be implemented for newline characters and ensuring correct column tracking during prefix consumption.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when encountering a newline character in the prefix string within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
- When a newline character is found, the column count is reset to 0, leading to incorrect behavior in handling comment indentation after a dedent.
- This results in comments being indented differently compared to the actual expected behavior, causing failures in the test cases provided.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and ensure correct comment indentation after a dedent, the processing of newline character handling needs to be adjusted. The column count should not be reset to 0 when encountering a newline, as it disrupts the expected indentation behavior.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Do not reset column count on encountering newline
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the mentioned adjustments in the provided corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug causing incorrect comment indentation after a dedent is resolved. This corrected version ensures that the column count remains consistent while handling newline characters, aligning with the expected behavior.
