### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the prefix string with respect to indentation and line breaks.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line after indentation.
3. The bug is related to incorrect handling of comments and indentation.
4. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function with different prefixes and columns.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not handle tab characters (`\t`) properly in the context of comments and column indentation.
2. When encountering tabs, the function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by a fixed value of 4 which leads to incorrect column tracking.
3. This incorrect handling results in a discrepancy in the indentation of comments after dedent operations.
4. The function fails to correctly align tabulated comments with the following lines.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters `\t` to ensure correct column tracking.
2. Adjust the way the function detects column indentation based on tab characters to align comments properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column based on tab characters
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1

                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]

                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 3  # Increment by 3 for space character
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the above corrections, the function should now correctly handle tab characters and align comments with the desired indentation, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
