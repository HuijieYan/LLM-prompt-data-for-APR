### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing prefixes within the content and adjusting the indentation based on certain conditions.
2. The function tracks the current line, column, and the need to wait for a new line. It iterates over the prefix character by character, updating the line, column, and waiting for a new line depending on the characters encountered.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when handling tab characters in the prefix related to comments, leading to incorrect indentation adjustments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle tab characters and ensure the correct behavior with comment indentation and line breaks.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tab characters within the prefix when processing comment indentation post dedent.
- When encountering tab characters, the function fails to adjust the column appropriately, leading to incorrect indentation alignment.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic related to tab characters to ensure that the column is incrementally adjusted correctly based on tabs.
- Implement a better way to handle tab characters when calculating the column position within the prefix.
- Make sure the function correctly processes comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now properly handle tab characters and adjust comment indentation post dedent according to the expected behavior.
