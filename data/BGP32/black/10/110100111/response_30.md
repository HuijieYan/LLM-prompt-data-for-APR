### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix given a specific column value, handling different cases of indentation characters (`' '`, `'\t'`) and newlines. The function incorrectly handles indentation levels after an indent. This causes the comments to be erroneously indented.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and indentation levels after dedent.
2. Inconsistent updating of `current_column` based on different character types.
3. Incorrect updating of `current_column` for spaces and tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails to properly maintain the correct indentation level of comments after dedent operations. When encountering a dedent situation, the function does not correctly evaluate the indentation level needed for the comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the function needs to account for maintaining correct comment indentation levels after dedents. Ensure that the function correctly handles different indentation characters (`' '`, `'\t'`) and updates the `current_column` value appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust column for partial tab
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the column calculation for tabs to account for partial tab characters and ensures the correct updating of the `current_column` value throughout the function.
