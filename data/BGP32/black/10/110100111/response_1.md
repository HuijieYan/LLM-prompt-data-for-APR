### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation in Python code, specifically for comments.
2. The function initializes some variables: `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`.
3. It iterates over each character in the provided `prefix` string and updates the variables accordingly.
4. There are issues with handling spaces, tabs, and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior in maintaining correct indentation when encountering comments in the input.
5. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is related to incorrect indentation handling for comments after dedent caused by the bug in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect indentation for comments after dedent when handling tabs in the input source code. The issue arises due to how the function manages spaces, tabs, and newlines during prefix consumption. This leads to incorrect handling of the comment indentation level.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should be updated to correctly handle all cases when encountering spaces, tabs, and newlines, especially in situations with comments after a dedent. The logic needs to preserve the correct indentation level by considering different scenarios and adjusting the variables appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By properly handling tabs and spaces in the indentation calculation, along with managing newlines after dedents and adjusting the column position for comments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test related to comment indentation issues.
