The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent operation when input has tabs. The function fails to properly update the `current_column` value after encountering a '\n' character along with a ' ' or '\t' character.

The bug causes incorrect indentation for comment lines after a dedent operation. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` aims to check whether comments are correctly indented after a dedent. The expected behavior is that comments maintain the same level of indentation as the code block they belong to.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of updating the `current_column` value whenever a '\n' character is encountered, so that the subsequent characters' indentation can be computed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Adjust current_column value after encountering '\n'
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the `current_column` value correctly after encountering a '\n' character, ensuring that the indentation remains consistent for comments after a dedent operation. This correction should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report as well.
