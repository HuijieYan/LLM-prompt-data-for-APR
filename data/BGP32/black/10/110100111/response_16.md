### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the given prefix based on the input column value.
2. The function keeps track of lines, current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the behavior of the function when encountering indentation after a newline character.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function with different input prefixes and columns.
5. The expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases give insights into the correct behavior expected.
6. The GitHub issue indicates that the indentation of comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent when using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering indentation after a newline character, the function does not correctly align the comment based on the column value provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters and adjusts the indentation of comments based on the input column value. The function needs to correctly recognize when to wait for a newline character and update the indentation accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments in the code above, the bug should now be fixed and pass the failing test cases while aligning the comments correctly based on the input column values.
