The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of the current column count and the wait_for_nl flag. The function is incorrectly updating the current_column count when encountering a newline character without considering the specific cases where the column should be reset.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic in the function to correctly handle the column count and reset it when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes an additional check when encountering a newline character to reset the current column count and handle the column count based on specific cases more accurately. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected for the provided test cases.
