### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic for handling tabs ('\t') as characters and counting their column width is incorrect. The function increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab, whereas it should only increase by 1. This discrepancy leads to incorrect column tracking when tabs are encountered in the input string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for calculating the column width when encountering tabs ('\t'). Instead of adding 4 to the `current_column`, we should increment it by 1. This adjustment will ensure that the column count accurately reflects the position in the string even when tabs are present.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly handles tabs and calculates the column width accurately, resolving the bug.
