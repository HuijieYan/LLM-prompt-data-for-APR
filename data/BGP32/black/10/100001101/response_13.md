### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a specific column value. The function iterates over the characters in the prefix, updating the current line, current column count, and detecting new lines to handle indentation.

The bug in the function arises from the logic related to waiting for a new line when encountering non-whitespace characters. In some cases, the wait_for_nl flag is not being set properly or reset causing incorrect behavior. This results in incorrect consumption of the prefix text, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix`, we need to ensure that the wait_for_nl flag is correctly set and reset based on the encountered characters. Additionally, the handling of column values and line splitting should be adjusted to accurately determine the consumed prefix text.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = current_column >= column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes adjustments to properly handle the wait_for_nl flag when encountering different characters and accounts for line breaks based on column values. It should now correctly consume the prefix text up to the specified column value.
