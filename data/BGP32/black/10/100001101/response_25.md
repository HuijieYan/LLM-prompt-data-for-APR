### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the conditional check for `wait_for_nl` is not being properly set before checking if the current column is less than the specified column value. This causes the function to incorrectly handle indentations and line constructions when encountering newline characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly updated when encountering indentation characters (`' '` and `'\t'`) and newline characters `'\n'`. This will allow the function to properly handle different cases of prefixes and column values.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # Adjusted the condition for handling proper line constructions
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making the adjustment to the condition under the `\n` case, the function is now able to correctly handle prefixes with varying indentations and column values. This corrected version should now return the expected values for the given test cases.
