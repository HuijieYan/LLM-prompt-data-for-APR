### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from not correctly updating the `current_column` variable when encountering a newline character. As a result, the current column count is not being reset to 0 as expected when a newline is encountered, leading to incorrect behavior in tracking the column count.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` variable is properly updated when a newline character is encountered. Specifically, when encountering a newline, the `current_column` should be set to 0 to indicate the start of a new line.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By resetting the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now properly track the column count and handle the input cases as expected.
