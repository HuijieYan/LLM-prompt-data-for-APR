### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. When the flag is set to `True`, the function should wait for a newline character (`'\n'`) before proceeding. However, the check for an empty line (`char == '\n'`) should be outside the `if wait_for_nl` condition block. This causes the function to prematurely exit without consuming the necessary prefix characters, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition for an empty line is checked outside the `if wait_for_nl` block. This adjustment will allow the function to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == '\n':  # Move this check outside the 'if wait_for_nl'
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected version correctly handles the condition for an empty line outside the `if wait_for_nl` block, ensuring that the prefix is consumed up to the specified column before returning the result.
