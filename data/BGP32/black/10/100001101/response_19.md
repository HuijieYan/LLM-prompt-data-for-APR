### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to check if the current column is less than the specified column value is incorrect. The function expects the column value to represent the indentation level, and it should check if the current level of indentation (measured by the number of leading spaces and tabs) is less than the specified column value.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition to correctly compare the current level of indentation with the specified column value. Additionally, we need to make sure that the function handles cases where the prefix ends without encountering a newline character.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrections in the code include:
- Checking the correct indentation level by comparing `len(current_line.expandtabs())` with the specified column value.
- Adjusting the increment for the column count when encountering a tab character to align with the column position.
- Handling the case where the prefix ends without encountering a newline character by returning the remaining prefix in the output.
