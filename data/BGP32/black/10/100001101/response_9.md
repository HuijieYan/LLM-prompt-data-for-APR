### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it does not handle cases where the prefix does not contain newlines adequately. In the case where there is no newline in the prefix, the function fails to return the correct result. The function assumes that each line in the prefix ends with a newline character, which leads to incorrect behavior when this assumption is violated.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the situation where there is no newline in the prefix correctly. We should adjust the logic to track the current column and check for the target column without relying solely on newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            return ''.join(lines), current_line

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by continually updating the `current_column` and comparing it with the target `column`. It ensures correct behavior even when there are no newline characters at the end of each line in the prefix.
