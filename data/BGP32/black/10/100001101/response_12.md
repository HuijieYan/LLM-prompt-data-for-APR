### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling indentation levels (`wait_for_nl`). When encountering a tab character (`\t`), the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of 1. This causes the function to misinterpret the indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters to correctly increment the `current_column` by 1 for each `\t` encountered. This adjustment will ensure that the function accurately tracks the column position and correctly determines the indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Update the increment for tabs to 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the handling of tab characters within the indentation logic is correctly accounted for, resolving the bug in the function.
