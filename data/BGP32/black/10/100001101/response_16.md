### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specific column value. It iterates over each character in the prefix and accumulates characters until it reaches a specific column position. However, there are issues in handling characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior and results.

### Issues:
1. The condition for checking if the column has been reached is not correctly implemented.
2. Handling of special characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines is causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation incorrectly handles spaces, tabs, and newlines, which results in incorrect counting of columns and behavior. This leads to the function not correctly identifying when to consume the prefix based on the specified column.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly track and compare the column position with the specified value.
2. Modify the way spaces, tabs, and newlines are processed to accurately calculate the column position and handle line breaks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' or current_column >= column:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function addresses the issues with handling special characters and accurately tracks the column position to consume the prefix correctly based on the specified column value. By implementing these changes, the function should now produce the expected results for all the provided test cases.
