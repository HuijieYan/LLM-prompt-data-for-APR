The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` lies in the condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True`. When encountering the newline character (`'\n'`), the function checks if the current line is not empty and if the current column is less than the specified column. If both conditions are met, it should return the joined lines and the remaining prefix.

### Bug Explanation:
- In Case 1, the condition `current_column < column` should be changed to `current_column <= column` to include the current column. This will ensure that the characters at the specified column are also extracted.
- The logic for handling the newline character is incorrect. It leads to missing the last line before the newline. The last line should be appended to `lines` and returned at the end of processing the prefix.
- In Case 3, the current column should be set to 1 instead of 4 after encountering the `\n` character.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the condition `current_column < column` to `current_column <= column`.
2. Move the logic for appending the last line to after the loop finishes processing the prefix.
3. Update the current column appropriately after encountering the `\n` character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_column += 1  # account for character consumption
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 3  # Adjust for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Append the line before newline
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After applying the corrections in the updated function, it should now correctly handle all the provided test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
