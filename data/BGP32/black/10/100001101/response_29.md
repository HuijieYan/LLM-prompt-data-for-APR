### Analysis
The buggy function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit, preserving the lines based on consecutive characters such as spaces, tabs, and new lines. However, there are some issues that prevent it from working correctly. 
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset after encountering a newline character, leading to a faulty logic flow.
2. The condition to check the column limit is incorrect, resulting in incorrect line preservation.

### Bug Explanation
In case 1, the buggy function fails to correctly handle the newline character, leading to an inconsistency in tracking the current line position. Due to the incorrect logic flow, the function fails to correctly determine the end of the line based on the specified column.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is reset after encountering a newline character and correctly check the column limit before preserving the current line.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By resetting `wait_for_nl` after encountering a newline character and modifying the check for the column limit, the corrected function should now handle the prefix string as intended and satisfy the expected input/output values.
