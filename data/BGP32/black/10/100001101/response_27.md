### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical issue in handling the indentation count. When a tab character (`\t`) is encountered, it increments the `current_column` by 4, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to increment `current_column` by the difference between the next multiple of 8 and the current column count.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic for handling tab characters (`\t`) to adjust the `current_column` correctly based on the desired indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column based on desired indentation level
            spaces_to_next_tab = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8 - current_column
            current_column += spaces_to_next_tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the `current_column` correctly when encountering tab characters (`\t`). Now, it increments the `current_column` by the necessary spaces to reach the next multiple of 8 based on the current indentation level. This fix ensures the correct handling of indentation levels for different cases.
