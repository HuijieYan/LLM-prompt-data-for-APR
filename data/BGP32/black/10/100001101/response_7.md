### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the handling of the tab character `'\t'`. It incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab character instead of just 1. This leads to incorrect tracking of the current column position and causes issues in correctly determining the prefix to consume.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the increment for the tab character from 4 to 1 to correctly track the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

Now, the function correctly increments the `current_column` by 1 when encountering a tab character, ensuring correct tracking of the column position and proper detection of the prefix to consume.
