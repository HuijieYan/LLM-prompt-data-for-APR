## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when processing the input prefix string. The function keeps track of the current line being constructed, the column position within that line, and whether it is waiting for a newline character. After appending characters to the current line, the function encounters issues when determining if an indent or a newline should occur.

In particular, the bug arises when handling spaces and tabs for indentation. The current implementation increments the `current_column` counter when encountering spaces or tabs but does not correctly adjust this counter when a newline is encountered. This leads to incorrect calculations of the column position and can cause issues in identifying the correct prefix part that needs to be consumed.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update how the `current_column` variable is managed when different characters are encountered in the prefix string. Specifically, we should reset the `current_column` to 0 when a newline character is encountered since a new line begins. Additionally, we should adjust the column count when encountering tabs or spaces based on the tab width convention (4 spaces per tab in this case).

## Corrected Code

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # adjust column for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column for new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the tab width adjustment in the column calculation and resetting the column count for newline characters, the corrected function should now correctly handle prefix manipulation as intended.
