### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when encountering a newline character (`\n`), it resets the `current_column` to 0 regardless of the actual column value. This causes the function to incorrectly handle scenarios where the newline character is in the middle of indentation spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the newline character to adjust the `current_column` based on the indentation level and not simply reset it to 0.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function takes into account the column value when encountering a newline character. It checks if the current column is less than the desired column value before resetting the column count to 0. This ensures that the function handles indentation spaces correctly.
