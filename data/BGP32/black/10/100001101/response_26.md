### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic related to handling the indentation level and waiting for a newline character. The function incorrectly handles the case when encountering a newline character '\n' and does not reset the current column position properly. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation level which results in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to newline characters and resetting the current column position. Specifically, when encountering a newline character, the current column position should be reset to 0 to correctly handle the indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current column position on encountering a newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By incorporating the corrected logic for handling newline characters and resetting the column position, the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the given column value.
