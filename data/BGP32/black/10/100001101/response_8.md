### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the condition that checks for an empty line when encountering a newline character. In some cases, the current line is not being processed correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when determining whether to wait for a new line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic related to handling newline characters to correctly process the current line and conditions for waiting for a new line.
2. Ensure that the current column count is appropriately updated based on the encountered characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjusting for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of newline characters and adjusting the tab width calculation, the corrected version of the function should now properly process the input prefixes and return the expected results for all test cases.
