The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is in the logic of handling the indentation (spaces, tabs) and new lines. The function is intended to consume characters from the prefix until a specific column is reached and return the consumed part of the prefix and the remaining part.

The error occurs when processing newline characters. The function incorrectly resets the current column to 0 when encountering a newline instead of counting it as a single character width. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the consumed part of the prefix.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for handling newline characters. Instead of resetting the current column to 0, we should increment it by 1 when encountering a newline character. This adjustment ensures that newline characters are considered as consuming a single character width.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column += 1  # Adjusted: Count newline as 1 character width
            # Handle newline based on current column
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle newline characters and correctly calculate the consumed part of the prefix according to the specified column.
