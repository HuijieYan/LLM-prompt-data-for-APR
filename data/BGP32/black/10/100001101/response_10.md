### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters an empty line (char == '\n') while iterating over the prefix string. In this case, the current_column is reset to 0, which is incorrect behavior as it should be incremented by 1 to reflect the newline character. This causes the function to incorrectly handle subsequent characters and leads to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the code to correctly handle the case when encountering a newline character. We should increment the current_column by 1 whenever a newline character is encountered to reflect the consumed character. This will ensure that subsequent characters are processed correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adding `current_column += 1` in the `elif char == '\n':` block, we ensure that the column count accurately reflects the consumed newline character. This fix should address the bug and correctly handle all edge cases.
