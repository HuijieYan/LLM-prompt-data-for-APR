### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters. When the function encounters a newline character, it should check if the current line exceeds the specified column limit. However, the current implementation does not properly reset the `current_column` value when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect calculations of the column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to reset the `current_column` value to zero whenever a newline character is encountered. This ensures that the column count starts from zero for each new line. Additionally, we must adjust the logic for tracking the column position based on spaces and tabs appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` value to zero when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now handle the indentation and column tracking correctly, satisfying the expected input/output values.
