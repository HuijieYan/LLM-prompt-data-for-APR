### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) while it is waiting for the next newline. When this happens, the `current_column` is reset to 0 which is incorrect because it should only be reset if there's an empty line. This leads to incorrect behavior in tracking the current column count and may lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition where `current_column` is reset to 0 to only happen when there is an empty line (`current_line.strip()`). This will ensure that the column count is maintained correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                if current_line.strip():  # check for empty line
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle the scenarios where the column count should be reset to 0 based on encountering an empty line only, and the expected behavior according to the provided cases should be achieved.
