### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. It iterates through the characters of the prefix and identifies where to stop based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for a newline, which leads to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while `wait_for_nl` is True (indicating it is waiting for a newline). In such cases, it incorrectly handles the current column value and fails to properly reset the line and column counters, leading to wrong slicing of the prefix string.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the condition where the function waits for a newline. When a newline character is encountered while waiting for one, the function should properly handle resetting the line and column counters to accurately slice the prefix string. Additionally, it should handle the scenario where there might be consecutive newline characters.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip() or current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By incorporating the outlined fixes, the corrected function should now properly handle all cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
