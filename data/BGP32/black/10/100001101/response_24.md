### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the premature handling of newlines before considering the indentation level. The function incorrectly resets the column count to 0 on encountering a newline, even if the preceding line is indented. This causes the function to misjudge the indentation level and return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column count is only reset to 0 when encountering a newline if the indentation level is satisfied. This can be achieved by updating the condition where the column count is reset based on the correct evaluation of indentation levels.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if previous line indentation was met before resetting column
            if current_column <= column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

### Solution Overview:
The corrected code effectively addresses the bug by resetting the column count to 0 only if the previous line's indentation level is within the specified column parameter. This ensures that the function accurately determines the indentation level and returns the correct results for each case.
