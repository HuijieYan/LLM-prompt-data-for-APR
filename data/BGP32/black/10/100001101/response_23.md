### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column position and return two parts of the prefix string. The bug causes incorrect handling of multiple consecutive newline characters and fails to adjust the `current_column` appropriately, leading to incorrect slicing and return values.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1: The function incorrectly handles the newline character, leading to an incorrect update of `current_column`. This causes the slicing of the prefix to be incorrect.
2. In Case 3: The function fails to properly handle the newline character, resulting in the incorrect value of `current_column`.
3. In Case 5: The function does not handle consecutive tabs correctly, impacting the `current_column` value and resulting in a faulty slicing operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters to correctly update the `current_column` value.
2. Update the handling of tabs to ensure correct calculation of the `current_column`.
3. Properly differentiate between empty lines and whitespace characters to handle all cases accurately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char.isspace():  # Handle whitespace characters
                current_column += 1
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tab width
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments and enhancements in the logic, the corrected function should now handle the cases correctly and produce the expected outputs for the provided test cases.
