### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that when a character is encountered that is not a space, tab, or newline, the function incorrectly sets `wait_for_nl` to True, indicating that it is waiting for a newline character. This behavior is incorrect because it should only wait for a newline character when encountering a space or tab before which it was waiting for such a character.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic for setting `wait_for_nl`. It should only be set to True when a space or tab is encountered, and the current indentation is finished. We should not set it to True when encountering other characters like letters or symbols.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The corrected code ensures that `wait_for_nl` is set to True only when needing a newline character after encountering a space or tab. If other characters are encountered, `wait_for_nl` is set to False, ending the line correctly.
