The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is caused by not correctly handling the case where the current column is less than the specified column value, resulting in incorrect slicing of the prefix string.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a new line character is encountered and the current line meets the condition for slicing, we correctly return the sliced prefix and the remaining prefix string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles the case where the current line meets the condition for slicing when encountering a new line character within the loop. Now, the function should return the correct prefix and remaining prefix string according to the specified column value.
