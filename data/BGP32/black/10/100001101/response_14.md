The bug in the code arises from the incorrect handling of the newline character and whitespace characters. The function is supposed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, but it fails to do so correctly in some cases.

The issues are:
1. When encountering a newline character (`'\n'`), the current column should be reset to 0, but it is not happening in all situations.
2. The calculation of the column for tab characters (`'\t'`) is not consistent.
3. The condition for checking if the current column has reached the specified column limit is not accurate.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle newline characters, tab characters, and whitespace characters while keeping track of the current column position accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust calculation for tab spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle all cases correctly by properly tracking the current column position, handling newline characters, tabs, and whitespace characters accurately.
