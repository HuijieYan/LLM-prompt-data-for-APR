The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentations for comments after dedent. The function mistakenly resets the `current_column` to 0 instead of maintaining the column position after dedent. This is causing the incorrect behavior in handling comments' indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the column position after dedent for comments. We should track the column position after dedent and maintain it for proper comment alignment.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        previous_indent = 0
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                        # Maintain the column position before the comment
                        current_column = previous_indent
                    else:
                        current_column = 0
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                previous_indent = current_column
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes tracking the `previous_indent` to store the column position before the comment line. When encountering a comment after dedent, the function now correctly aligns the comment based on the previous indent level.

This fix should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report and make the `_partially_consume_prefix` function handle comment indentation properly.
