### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a part of `prefix` until a certain `column` limit is reached or a new line character is encountered.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation levels and new line characters, especially for tabulated content.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` focuses on scenarios where comments are involved and their indentation changes after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where tabulated input code leads to incorrect comment indentation after Black reformatting.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test scenario, when the function encounters a new line character in the `prefix`, it doesn't handle the indent level correctly for subsequent lines, causing inconsistent comment indentation.
2. The function's logic to track indent levels is flawed, leading to incorrect handling of indentation in various cases, especially when dealing with tabulated content.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic of `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly maintain the current indent level and handle new line characters to ensure consistent comment indentation.
2. Adjust the code to properly track the column position and handle tabulated content to align with the expected behavior of the failing test and the GitHub issue scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function has been updated to address the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, especially in scenarios with tabulated content. The adjustments made in the function logic should align the output with the expected behavior of the failing test and resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
