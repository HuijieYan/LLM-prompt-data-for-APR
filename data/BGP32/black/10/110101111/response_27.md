### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string and separate lines based on a given column width.
2. The bug seems to occur when dealing with tab characters and tracking the current column. The issue might relate to how the function handles tab characters vs. spaces for indentation.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the handling of comments after dedent. The bug affects tabulated comments after a dedent, causing incorrect indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles tab characters for indentation and adjusts the current column value accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Track the real column width accurately by considering the effect of tab characters.
2. Adjust the current column value based on the actual position of the cursor in the line.
3. Update the condition checking for tab characters to increment the column by the appropriate amount.
4. Make sure the function keeps correct track of the current line and column to handle comments after dedent accurately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the way tab characters affect the column position and improving the tracking of the current line and column values, the corrected version aims to resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
