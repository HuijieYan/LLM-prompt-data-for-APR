The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to occur when there is a comment following an indented block. The function incorrectly handles the indentation for comments and leads to incorrect behavior when processing the prefix.

The issue seems to stem from the handling of indentation and line breaks within the loop, causing the function to misinterpret the correct indentation level for comments.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles indentation levels and line breaks, especially when encountering comments that follow an indented block.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle newline correctly
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the indentation and line breaks, ensuring that the comments are aligned correctly even after a block is dedented. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
