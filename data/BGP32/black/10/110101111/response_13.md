## Bug Fix Strategy
The issue seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation when the input file uses tabs. To fix this bug, it is necessary to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the function should correctly handle the indentation of comments that follow a dedent operation, ensuring that the comments are aligned as expected.

The root cause of the bug appears to be in the `wait_for_nl` logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The current implementation is not correctly handling the scenario where a comment follows a dedent operation. By revising how the function tracks the current column and processes the indentations, we can address this bug.

To fix the bug, the revised function should accurately handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent operation, ensuring that the comments align with the correct indent level of the code. This adjustment will address the reported issue on GitHub and align the output with the expected behavior for files using tabs for indentation.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The corrected version of the previously buggy function

class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column: # Adjusted condition to include equal columns
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8  # Adjusted to increment by 8 for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the indentation handling in the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the function should now correctly align comments following a dedent operation, ensuring that the comments maintain the expected indentation level. This adjustment should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
