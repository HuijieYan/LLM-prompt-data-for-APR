Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation levels within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It fails to maintain the correct alignment of comments when encountering different levels of indentation.

To address this issue, we need to make sure that the function correctly tracks the column level for each character and adjusts the indentation appropriately in the presence of tabs and spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        lines.append(current_line.lstrip())
                    break
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the indentation of comments correctly, considering both spaces and tabs. It now properly keeps track of the current column level and adjusts the lines accordingly.

By applying this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases provided and resolve the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
