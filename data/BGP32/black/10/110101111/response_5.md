## Bug Fix Strategy
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the continuation of indentation for comments. It fails to consider the existing indentation level when encountering a comment in a new line after an indent. The function should maintain the previous indentation level when handling comments within the same block.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to keep track of the indentation level when encountering comments and ensure that the indentation is correctly maintained.
2. The function should appropriately handle cases where the input code contains a mix of tabs and spaces for indentation.

Let's proceed with the corrected version of the function:

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)  # Maintain the previous indentation level
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished or within a comment
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we ensure that the indentation level is correctly maintained when encountering comments after indents. This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub report by preserving the correct indentation in the output.
