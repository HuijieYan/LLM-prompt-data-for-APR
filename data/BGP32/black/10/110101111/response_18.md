After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, we can identify the cause of the bug. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle prefix indentation, but it fails to correctly adjust the comment's indentation in some cases. The issue arises when the function encounters a comment after a dedent (reduction in indentation level).

The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables when it encounters a newline after a dedent, which causes the comment's indentation to be incorrect. This is evident in the failing test cases where comments are not correctly aligned after a dedent.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the function to handle comments correctly after a dedent. We can achieve this by maintaining the correct indentation level even after a dedent operation by considering the previous indentation level before the dedent.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        prev_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = prev_column
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                prev_column = current_column
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the comment's indentation is correctly maintained even after a dedent operation. It considers the previous indentation level before the dedent and adjusts the comment's indentation accordingly.

By updating the function with this corrected version, the failing test cases related to comment indentation should now pass, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
