The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of tabs and spaces in the input prefix when determining the correct indentation level for comments. The current implementation does not correctly handle all cases leading to incorrect behavior in the presence of tabs.

The bug causes incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent operation in the input code, especially when using tabs for indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the column position considering both spaces and tabs. One approach could be converting tabs to spaces and then adjusting the `current_column` accordingly when encountering tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                char = ' ' * (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Convert tabs to spaces
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issue and ensure that the comments' indentation is retained correctly after dedent operations. It handles tabs by converting them to spaces and keeps track of the correct column position for comments.

Please test the function with the failing tests to confirm that it now correctly handles the indentation of comments, especially with tabs involved.
