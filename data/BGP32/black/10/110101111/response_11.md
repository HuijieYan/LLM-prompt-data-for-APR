### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function processes a prefix string character by character to construct lines based on indentation levels and extract the remaining prefix after the specified column.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation after dedents.
3. In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of the comment.
4. The bug seems to occur when there is a comment after a dedent operation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling the wait_for_nl flag and indentation levels after dedents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Introduce a flag to track whether the function is within an indentation block.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle indentation levels after dedents.
3. Ensure that the comment indentation aligns with the surrounding code.
4. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        in_indent = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if in_indent:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    in_indent = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                in_indent = True
                current_column = 0
            else:
                in_indent = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After implementing these changes, re-run the failing test cases to ensure that the corrected function produces the expected outputs and resolves the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
