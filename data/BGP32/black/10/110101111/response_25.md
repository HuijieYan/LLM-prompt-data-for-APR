The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the incorrect handling of the indentation level when encountering comments after dedent. The issue is triggered by a tab size of 4 characters. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly calculate the column indentation based on tabs and spaces.

Here is a corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            if current_column <= column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = char
                current_column = 0
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), ""
```

This corrected version ensures that the indentation calculation is corrected by handling both tabs and spaces properly. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
