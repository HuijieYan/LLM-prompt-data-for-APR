### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string considering indentation and newlines, returning the consumed content and the remaining content. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedents in the provided test cases, leading to incorrect output.

### Error Location:
The main issue lies in the logic related to handling the indentation level and waiting for a newline character. Specifically, the logic fails to correctly account for the indentation level after comment lines following dedents.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the failing test cases, the function fails to maintain the correct column position when encountering comments after dedents, leading to incorrect indentation for those comments. The incorrect handling of indentation levels, especially after dedents and comments, results in the function returning the wrong consumed content.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to track the indentation level properly, especially when encountering comments following dedents. It should correctly calculate the required indentation for such cases to maintain the original structure of the code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False

            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                continue

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the bug by fixing the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and ensuring correct indentation calculation. This should now correctly process the prefix string and maintain the expected indentation level, passing the failing test cases and resolving the GitHub issue.
