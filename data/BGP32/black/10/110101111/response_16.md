Based on the given information, the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling the indentation of comments in the input code. The function fails to properly maintain the desired indentation level for comments after dedent in the input code.

The issue arises from the logic involving the `wait_for_nl` flag, which should trigger the update of the current column to the correct value after encountering a newline character. However, the mechanism fails to adjust the indentation level for the subsequent comment correctly.

To fix this bug, we should track whether we are currently parsing an indentation level and then adjust the column value accordingly when processing newline characters. Additionally, we need to properly handle the case where a comment follows a dedent operation to maintain the correct indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        in_indent = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if not in_indent and not char.isspace():
                in_indent = True
            
            if in_indent:
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                        in_indent = False
                else:
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif char == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
                    elif char == '\n':
                        wait_for_nl = True
                    current_line += char
            else:
                current_line += char
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version introduces the `in_indent` flag to track whether the function is currently processing an indentation level. This allows the function to adjust the current column properly and handle comment indentation after dedent operations in the input code.
