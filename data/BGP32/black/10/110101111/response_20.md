### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached based on indentation rules.
2. The bug seems to be around handling newline characters when building `current_line`.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent, leading to unexpected indentation in the output.
4. A potential fix involves correctly maintaining the column count after newline characters for proper indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain the `current_column` count correctly after encountering newline characters.
2. Ensure that the comment indentation respects the intended column position.
3. Adjust the logic around detecting newline characters and resetting the column count.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        wait_for_nl = False
                    else:
                        current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
                else:
                    if char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    elif char == '\t':
                        current_column += 4
                    else:
                        wait_for_nl = True
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of newline characters, the corrected function should now properly handle comment indentation after a dedent, resolving the GitHub issue and passing the failing test cases.
