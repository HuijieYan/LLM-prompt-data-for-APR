### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is attempting to consume part of a string (`prefix`) until reaching a specified column index. However, the function incorrectly handles the case where a newline character is encountered after the target column, leading to incorrect outputs.

Upon analysis of the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, it is evident that the problem arises when the function encounters a newline character while trying to align comments. This behavior results in misaligned comments, as reported in the GitHub issue regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause
1. The issue arises when the function reaches `char == '\n'` condition and incorrectly assumes that the indentation level is reset, resulting in misaligned comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should properly handle the scenario when encountering newline characters while preserving the alignment of comments.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
                    if current_column >= column and char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                        wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring correct handling of newline characters and preserving comment alignment, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
