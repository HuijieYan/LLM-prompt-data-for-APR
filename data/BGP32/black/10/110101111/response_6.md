### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect indentation handling in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the issue arises when encountering comments after dedentations where the code uses tab characters for indentation. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments following dedented code blocks, causing the incorrect formatting observed by the failing tests and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly maintains the correct indentation level for comments, especially after dedented code blocks when using tabs for indentation. We should adjust the logic related to `wait_for_nl` and handle tab characters' impact on indentation appropriately.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Ensure correct tabulation of columns
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made
1. Added handling for tab characters in the indentation calculation. Now, tab characters adjust the column position to the next multiple of 4, aligning with the intended behavior when using tabs for indentation.
2. Adjusted the `elif` condition for tab characters to correctly update the `current_column` variable to maintain the correct indentation level.
3. Removed the condition checking for space characters since they are irreverent for the specific issue with comments following dedented blocks.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly handle tab characters and preserve the correct indentation levels for comments following dedentations. This fix should address the failing tests and the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after dedents.
