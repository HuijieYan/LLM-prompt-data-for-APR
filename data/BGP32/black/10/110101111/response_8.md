## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

### Buggy function explanation
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class aims to handle the indentation of code prefixes based on spaces and tabs. It processes each character of the prefix, updating a `current_line` string, a `current_column` counter, and a `wait_for_nl` flag to track the state of the indentation process.

### Failing test explanation
The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the test file tests the behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function with different inputs related to indentation and comments. The test compares the formatted output by `fs()` (part of the test code) with the expected contents, checking that the function processes comments and indentation correctly.

### Error locations within the function
1. The function does not correctly handle the indentation level calculation when encountering tabs.
2. The logic related to handling tabs and spaces for calculating the column is flawed, resulting in incorrect indentation processing.

### Bug cause explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels, especially when mixing tabs and spaces in the prefix. This results in improperly formatted code, as seen in the failing test scenarios.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the logic for handling tabs and spaces consistently to calculate the correct column and line indentation.
2. Ensure that the function processes tabs and spaces uniformly to maintain the correct indentation level in the output.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the tab handling logic to ensure a consistent calculation of the `current_column`. It handles both tabs and spaces correctly to maintain the correct indentation level in the processed prefix.
