## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the indentations for lines that are comments. The function currently does not properly preserve the initial indentations for comments after dedentations. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly maintains the initial indentations for comment lines after dedents.

### Approach:
1. Update the function to keep track of the initial indentation level for each line.
2. Adjust the logic to properly preserve the initial indentations of comment lines after dedents.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        initial_indent = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            # Determine the current indentation level
            indent_level = current_column // 4 if char == ' ' else current_column // 4
            
            # If waiting for a newline, check and preserve the initial indentation of the comment line
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and indent_level < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indentation is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                initial_indent = indent_level
                    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle initial indentations of comment lines after dedents, the corrected version should resolve the issue with the failing tests related to comment indentations.
