### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string up to a certain column value. However, the logic within the function seems to mishandle whitespace characters and tabs, leading to incorrect behavior in handling comments, as specified in the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.

### Error Location:
The key issue arises from the handling of different types of characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, which causes incorrect tracking of the current indentation level and the position in the prefix string.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function does not handle the scenario where a comment is preceded by multiple tabs accurately, resulting in incorrect indentation.
2. The logic for updating the current column when encountering a tab character is faulty, leading to discrepancies in the calculated column value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, adjustments should be made to correctly handle tabs and spaces for determining the current column value. Additionally, the condition for checking comments' positions relative to the specified column needs to be refined to ensure correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4  # Adjust for tabs
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                current_line += char
                if char not in {' ', '\t'}:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections as mentioned above, run the failing test `test_comment_indentation`. The corrected function should now produce the expected output, passing all the test cases related to prefix processing in the specified column.
