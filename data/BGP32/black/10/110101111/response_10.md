### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, which aims to manage indentation for comments in Python code.
2. The method currently has issues with handling the correct indentation level for comments after dedents.
3. In the failing test `test_comment_indentation` of the `test_black.py` file, two input sets (one using tabs and one using spaces) are formatted to be equal, which reveals the incorrect behavior of the function.
4. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments after dedents.
5. The runtime variables reveal discrepancies in the calculation of the current column and the logic to wait for a newline character for correct indentation handling.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is the improper management of the `wait_for_nl` flag within the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, as well as incorrect updates to the `current_column` variable.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set/reset appropriately based on the input characters. Additionally, the `current_column` update logic needs to accurately reflect the actual indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column != column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version adjusts the logic for updating the `current_column` value and ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is appropriately handled to maintain correct indentation levels for comments after dedents.
