## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after dedents. It fails to account for handling comments when changes in indentation occur.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights that comments following dedents should maintain the same level of indentation, especially when tabs are used.
3. The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` value when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect indentation processing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments following dedents retain the correct indentation level by adjusting the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix`.

## Correction Strategy
1. Maintain the `current_column` value for lines containing comments to preserve their correct indentation level.
2. Update the logic to properly track the indentation level when encountering different types of characters.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles comments following dedents to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            # keep track of the indentation level for lines with comments
            old_column = current_column

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and old_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # handle comments after dedents
                if '#' in current_line:
                    current_column = old_column
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                # stop increasing the current_column after encountering non-space characters
                wait_for_nl = True

            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the corrected version should now handle comments following dedents correctly, aligning with the expected behavior and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
