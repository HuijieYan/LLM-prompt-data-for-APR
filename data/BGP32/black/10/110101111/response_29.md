The problem in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters when processing prefixes with varying indentation styles. 

The bug occurs because the function fails to consider the correct column value when encountering different types of whitespace characters like tabs and spaces followed by newlines. This issue leads to incorrect determination of the indentation level, resulting in misalignments of comments and code blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function tracks the current column position based on the whitespace characters encountered. We should ensure that the `current_column` value reflects the actual indentation level correctly and update it accordingly when processing different types of whitespace.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring the correct adjustment of the `current_column` value and handling newline characters appropriately, the corrected function will accurately consume the prefix while maintaining the expected indentation levels for comments and code blocks in the presence of mixed whitespace characters. This fix should address the reported GitHub issue regarding incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
