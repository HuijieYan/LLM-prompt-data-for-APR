### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a portion of the input prefix based on the given column. It handles indentation and new lines in the prefix.
2. The bug appears to be related to how the indentation is handled after dedenting when encountering comments in the prefix.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the expected behavior of handling comment indentation after dedent. The runtime values and types show discrepancies in the handling of characters like tabs and spaces.
4. To fix the bug, the function should ensure correct tracking of column positions after dedenting and properly handle different types of indentation characters.
5. The correction should address the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation.

### Correction:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':  # Update to correctly handle tab indentation
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():  # Handle empty line situations
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if char == '#':  # Adjust handling of comments
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    current_column += 1
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab indentation, new lines, and comments, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix based on the given column, ensuring correct indentation, especially around comments after dedenting.
