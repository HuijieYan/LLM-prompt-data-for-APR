## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of comment indentation after dedent operations, especially with tabs in the input. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing prefix lines, and in the failing test, it fails to preserve the correct indentation for tabulated comments.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tabulated comments and indentation levels should be closely examined. The current implementation does not properly handle the expected behavior when encountering comments after an indent operation. Adjusting the check for tab characters and newlines while accumulating lines and columns should help maintain the correct indentation.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust for tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version provided above, the function should now correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation, resolving the issue outlined in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
