The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of whitespace characters. The function is meant to consume a portion of a prefix string while keeping track of the current column to handle indentation correctly when encountering newlines. However, the logic for tracking the current column and handling whitespace characters like spaces and tabs is flawed.

The issue occurs when the function encounters a tab character ('\t') and increments the `current_column` by 4. This is incorrect, as a tab character should typically advance the column to the next multiple of 8 (standard tab stops). Additionally, the preservation of whitespace and columns seems to be incorrect leading to misalignments in the output.

To fix this bug:
1. Adjust the logic for tracking the current column based on encountered characters.
2. Ensure proper handling of indentation with tabs.
3. Adjust the logic for preserving whitespace so that the returned prefix maintains correct alignment.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust column based on tab stops
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle prefixes with proper preservation of whitespace, correct column tracking, and indentation handling with tab characters. This revised version should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case provided.
