### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function appears to process a prefix string by detecting newlines, spaces, and tabs to adjust the indentation level.
2. The bug might stem from incorrect handling of tab characters and the transition between different indentation levels.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to check the correct handling of comments in different indentation levels, but the function fails to maintain the expected indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of tab characters and correct adjustment of indentation levels.
5. The fixed version of the function should pass all failing test cases and address the GitHub issue regarding incorrect indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Updated Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab characters in the `elif char == '\t':` block, we ensure the correct adjustment of the current column based on tab stops. This adjustment helps maintain proper indentation levels, addressing the issue of incorrect indentation of tabulated comments after a dedent.

Please replace the existing buggy function with this corrected version to successfully pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to indentation errors.
