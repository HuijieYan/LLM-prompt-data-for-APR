### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle prefix consumption up to a given column. However, the bug seems to occur when handling tab characters and indentations before comments, leading to incorrect behavior for tabulated comments after dedents as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
The primary issue seems to lie in how tab characters are handled in the function, especially when calculating the column for indentation.

### Cause of the Bug
For case 1, the current logic triggers an incorrect return value when encountering a new line, missing the necessary adjustments for tab characters and indentations. This leads to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after dedents, as seen in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to revisit how tab characters are processed and how the column is updated during each character iteration, especially when dealing with new lines and indents. Adjustments need to be made to ensure correct consumption of prefixes up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_indent = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_indent += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_indent += 4
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                current_indent = 0
            if current_indent < column and current_line.strip():
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts how tab characters and indents are handled, ensuring correct prefix consumption up to the specified column. With these adjustments, the function should now be able to handle tabulated comments after dedents accurately.
