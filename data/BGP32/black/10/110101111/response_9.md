### Identified issue in the buggy function

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is not correctly handling the case when a comment is encountered in the prefix input. This issue is evident when analyzing the runtime values and types of variables in the provided failing tests.

1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly identifies the '\n' character in the comment line as a newline character that should reset the column count. This results in an incorrect adjustment of the indent for the comment line.
2. In Case 3, a similar problem occurs where the function misinterprets the newline character within the comment and advances the column count incorrectly.

These issues are related because the function does not differentiate between comment lines and actual control flow lines, leading to incorrect handling of indentation.

### Bug fix strategy

To address the identified issue, we need to modify the logic of `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the indentation for comment lines. Specifically, we should skip advancing the column count when encountering characters within comments and process the comment line separately.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        comment_line = ""

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res + comment_line, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    comment_line = ""
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if comment_line:
                    comment_line += char
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                if not current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    comment_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle comment lines separately and ensure that the column count is not affected by characters within comments, the corrected version should resolve the indentation issue observed in the failing tests.
