### Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle the indentation of lines based on a given column value. It processes each character, updating the current line and column accordingly.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentations, especially with tabs, causing incorrect column counting and line construction.
- The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare and assert the correct formatting of content with differing tab/space indentations.

### Bug Explanation:
- In various runtime scenarios provided, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation after dedents, primarily when tabs are involved.
- The combination of tab and space characters alongside newlines leads to inconsistencies in tracking the column and accumulating lines.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the function's logic to accurately track tab sizes and spaces when calculating columns.
- Adjust the conditions related to indentations and newlines to ensure consistent behavior across different indentation styles.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust for tabs
                current_column += (-current_column % 4)  # Adjust to next multiple of 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
1. Adjust the column calculation for tabs to handle the appropriate offset (4 spaces for each tab).
2. Correctly handle the conditions for newlines to ensure consistent handling of lines and indentations.
