### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on indentation columns and handling newline characters.
2. The function seems to have issues with resetting the indentation level after encountering a newline character.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function when dealing with comments and indentation, which aligns with the reported GitHub issue of incorrect indentation after a dedent.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function resets the current column after encountering a newline and is not handling the indentation correctly based on the provided cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly reset the `current_column` to `0` after encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect indentation calculation and failing to align comments properly after dedents.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly reset to `0` when encountering a newline character. Additionally, the logic for handling the indentation levels needs to be adjusted to align with the expected behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of `current_column` and the logic related to resetting the indentation after encountering a newline character. It should now properly handle the indentation and comments alignment as expected, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
