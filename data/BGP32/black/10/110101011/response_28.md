### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function processes a prefix string character by character to handle indentation levels correctly. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a newline character before considering the current line as complete.
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for one. It incorrectly handles the situation by adding the current line to the `lines` list without considering the indentation level criteria.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent in the test case, leading to failing assertions.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to maintain the correct indentation levels when processing newlines.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # indent is finished
                    wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle newlines correctly and ensuring the indentation levels are maintained, the corrected function should now process the prefix string accurately, fixing the indentation issue reported in the GitHub thread.
