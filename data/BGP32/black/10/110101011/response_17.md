### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on indentation to handle specific cases.
2. The function iterates over characters in the prefix and processes them accordingly to maintain indentation levels and handle newlines.
3. The bug occurs when handling the case of waiting for a newline character after detecting an indent level.
4. The function fails to correctly update the current line and column values when encountering a newline character.
5. This bug leads to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function fails to reset the `current_line` and `current_column` values correctly when encountering a newline character after indent detection.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that after encountering a newline character, the `current_line` and `current_column` values are reset appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue  # Skip remaining logic for this iteration
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # Reset for a new line
            current_line = ""
            continue  # Skip remaining logic for this iteration
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, the bug causing incorrect comment indentation after dedent should be resolved. This corrected version ensures proper handling of newline characters to maintain the correct indentation levels.
