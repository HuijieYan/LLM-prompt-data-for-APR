### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming the prefix of a given string based on specific conditions related to indentation. The function uses a combination of tracking `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` flags to determine when to stop consuming characters from the prefix.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition where `if wait_for_nl` is checked to handle the indentation when encountering a newline character.
2. The logic within the `if wait_for_nl` and `elif char == '\n'` blocks seems to have issues.
3. The return statement doesn't seem to be handling all cases correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case for the `test_comment_indentation` function, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent. The current implementation does not maintain proper indentation for comments when there is a mixture of spaces and tabs in the input prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to handling `wait_for_nl` and newline characters.
2. Ensure that the function correctly consumes characters based on the specified conditions.
3. Update the return statement to handle all scenarios where the prefix should be partially consumed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the function to handle all cases related to indentation and comments appropriately, the corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
