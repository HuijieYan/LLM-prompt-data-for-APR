### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, which is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on certain conditions related to whitespace characters.
2. The function accumulates characters from the `prefix` string, calculating the current column based on spaces and tabs.
3. There is an issue when encountering a newline character (`\n`) while waiting for newline (`wait_for_nl`) as it doesn't correctly handle the case when the current line is empty.
4. The GitHub issue indicates the problem with changing the indentation for comments past depth 0 incorrectly after a dedent, especially when tabs are used.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the current line when encountering a newline character and waiting for a newline.
- Specifically, when the function encounters an empty line (`char == '\n'`) while waiting for a newline, it should reset the current column to 0, but it fails to update the `lines` list correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that empty lines are handled properly while waiting for a newline. If an empty line is encountered, the current line should be added to the `lines` list, and the appropriate variables should be reset to handle the next line correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current line and column for empty lines
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring that empty lines are correctly handled and the variables are reset when encountering a newline character, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
