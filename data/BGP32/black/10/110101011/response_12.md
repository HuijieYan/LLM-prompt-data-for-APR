### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a portion of a prefix string based on indentation and column information. The function accumulates characters in `current_line`, adjusts `current_column` based on character types (space, tab, newline), and checks for the condition to wait for a newline. However, the issue seems to be with the logic of handling indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails in scenarios where comments are placed after a dedent operation, especially when tabs are used for indentation. The function does not correctly handle the indentation level of such comments, leading to incorrect output versus the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments after a dedent operation maintain the correct indentation level based on the preceding code block. Adjustments are necessary in the logic that determines the correct column position after dedent to preserve the intended formatting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 # Adjust based on specific tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is added after encountering a newline to verify if the column is less than the specified column value. If so, it indicates a dedent operation, so the new line is added to maintain correct indentation. This adjustment ensures that comments following a dedent are indented correctly.
