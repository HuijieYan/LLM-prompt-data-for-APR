### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on indentation rules.
- The function maintains `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables to keep track of the input prefix and indentation.
- The function incorrectly handles the case when encountering a newline character after consuming whitespace characters.
- The function is failing to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bugs:
1. The function does not update the `lines` list correctly when encountering a newline character after consuming whitespace characters.
2. The function fails to handle the scenario where comments are present after a dedent and the indentation is not maintained properly, especially when using tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic where `lines` list is updated to ensure proper formatting when encountering a newline character.
2. Modify the logic to handle comments after a dedent more accurately to address the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip():  # Updated to skip empty lines
                    continue
                if current_column < column:  # Preserve indent if column rule not met
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as provided above, the bugs related to handling the prefix with proper indentation, newline characters, and comments after dedents should be resolved. This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test case and address the GitHub issue regarding incorrect indentation when using tabs.
