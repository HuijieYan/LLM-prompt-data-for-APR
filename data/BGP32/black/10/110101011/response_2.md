### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string, maintaining indentation based on spaces and tabs, returning lines based on a specific column.
   
2. The function fails to properly handle cases where the prefix contains comments or empty lines after an indent. This leads to incorrect behavior in the test case related to comment indentation.

3. The failing test case expects correct indentation for comments, but the function fails to handle tabs and spaces properly after dedents or empty lines.

4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `wait_for_nl` condition to correctly handle situations where the next line is a comment, ensuring proper indentation alignment based on the column value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `wait_for_nl` condition to properly handle comment lines after dedents.
2. Consider the column value when determining the appropriate indentation for the comment lines.
3. Ensure that the function processes both tabs and spaces correctly to maintain the desired indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        if current_line:
            lines.append(current_line)
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `wait_for_nl` condition to correctly handle comment lines after dedents and ensuring proper alignment based on column value, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
