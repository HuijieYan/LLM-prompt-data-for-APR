### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing the prefix string, maintaining indentation levels based on spaces and tabs, and separating lines based on columns. The function seems to have issues with correctly handling the indentation for comments after a dedent operation, resulting in incorrect output.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition to handle the indentation after a dedent operation seems incorrect.
2. The logic to manage indentation levels using spaces and tabs may not be properly tracking the columns. 

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the misinterpretation of the column value after certain characters and the logic to handle wait_for_nl. This leads to incorrect recognition of the comment indentation level, especially after a dedent operation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check and adjust the conditions for correctly updating the column value.
2. Ensure that the function can properly identify the start of a comment line after dedent.
3. Adjust the handling of columns based on spaces and tabs to maintain accurate indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
    lines.append(current_line)
    
    res = ''
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res += line[:column-current_column]
        res += line[column-current_column:] + '\n'
    
    return res, prefix[len(''.join(lines))-1:]
```

By adjusting the handling of columns and line processing, the corrected function should now accurately maintain the comment indentation level even after a dedent operation. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure proper behavior for the failing test cases.
