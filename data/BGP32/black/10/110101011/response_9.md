### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the prefix based on the given column value, but it fails to handle the indentation correctly for comments. The function seems to have issues with tracking the column and handling the indentation while processing the prefix string. This bug specifically affects the handling of comments after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the column value when encountering comment lines after dedent operations. In the provided failing test case, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments, leading to incorrect output formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for tracking the column value accurately, especially when encountering different indentation types (spaces, tabs).
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation level and maintains it consistently, particularly for comment lines.
3. Modify the logic for identifying the start of a new line to correctly handle indentation changes.
4. Refine the conditions for detecting comment lines and adjusting the column value accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == '#':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the corrected version should be able to handle the indentation of comments correctly after dedent operations, addressing the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
