### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string based on indentation levels and columns.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column, a list of lines, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle newlines correctly.
3. The bug occurs when handling comments where the indentation should be preserved, but after dedent, it gets altered.
4. The bug is related to incorrect indentation handling after dedent, leading to the wrong output.

### Bug Cause:
1. The current implementation does not consider the correct handling of comments after a dedent operation.
2. When encountering a comment after dedent, the function fails to preserve the original indentation level.
3. This results in incorrect alignment of comments as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a comment after dedent, the function maintains the correct indentation level based on the previous line.
2. Adjust the logic to handle comments in a way that preserves their original alignment relative to the code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Check if comment is encountered after dedent and adjust indentation
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#') and current_column < column:
                    while current_column < column:
                        current_line = '\t' + current_line  # Preserve tab indentation
                        current_column += 4  # Adjust column
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correction logic mentioned above, the function should now correctly handle comments' indentation after a dedent operation. This adjustment will ensure that the comments preserve their original alignment relative to the code, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
