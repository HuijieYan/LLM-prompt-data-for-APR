### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is trying to handle partially consuming a prefix string based on a given column value.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and state to correctly split the prefix string.
3. The bug seems to occur when there is an unexpected empty line or when switching from indentation to non-indentation.
4. The function is failing to maintain the correct indentation after the comments in certain scenarios, leading to the failing test cases.
5. This bug corresponds to the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when switching from indentation to non-indentation within the prefix string, particularly when encountering comment lines.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the transition from indentation to non-indentation, especially when comments are involved. We should adjust the logic to maintain correct indentation levels for comments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # avoid adding empty lines to maintain correct indentation
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if not current_line.strip():
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying the corrected version of the function should ensure the correct handling of indentation transitions, particularly when dealing with comments. This updated logic should resolve the indentation issue mentioned in the failing test and GitHub issue.
