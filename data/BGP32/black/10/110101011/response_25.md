### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming the prefix input string up to a specified column value while handling different types of characters including tabs, spaces, and newlines.
2. The bug seems to occur when encountering a '\n' character after waiting for a newline (wait_for_nl = True) and not handling the indentation correctly.
3. The bug is likely causing incorrect handling of newline characters, leading to incorrect indentation levels within comments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct handling of newline characters and indentation levels is performed when determining the consumed prefix.

### Correction:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Adjust indentation on new line
                    current_line = ' ' * current_column
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific condition to adjust the current_line indentation based on the current_column value encountered before a newline. This adjustment should help maintain the correct indentation levels when consuming the prefix string.
