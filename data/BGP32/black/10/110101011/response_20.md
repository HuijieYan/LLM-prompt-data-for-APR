### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached. However, in the provided code, there are issues in handling different types of characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines which results in incorrect behavior for text indentation.

### Identified issues:
1. The handling of characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines is causing incorrect indentation tracking.
2. The logic for determining when to wait for a newline character is flawed, leading to premature line breaks.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of characters and tracking of current indentation levels within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This results in incorrect behavior in maintaining correct indentation levels, especially with tab characters.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for tracking current column position based on spaces and tabs to ensure accurate indentation tracking.
2. Revise the logic for determining when to wait for a newline character to prevent premature line breaks and maintain proper indentation.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # updated to consider tab as 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                # newline detected, reset the current column
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying these modifications should help resolve the issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent and also address the failing test cases.
