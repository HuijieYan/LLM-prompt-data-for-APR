### Issues with the Buggy Function:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the scenario correctly where a comment is right after a dedent operation.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` is not correct, causing incorrect behavior for comments after dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to maintain the correct indent level for comments that follow a dedent operation. This leads to incorrect handling of comments and disrupts the proper formatting of the code.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic inside the function to correctly handle dedent scenarios.
2. Update the calculations for `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` to ensure correct behavior.
3. Adjust the algorithm to properly align comments based on the indent level.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column > 0 and current_line.strip()[-1] == ':':
                    # Adjust indent based on the presence of ':'
                    current_column -= 4
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made in the Corrected Version:
1. Added a check to adjust the `current_column` when encountering a newline after an indented line ending with `':`.
2. Modified the calculation logic to handle the correct indent level for comments after dedent.
3. Updated the conditional statements to ensure proper handling of different scenarios.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should effectively handle the indentation issues with comments after dedent operations and resolve the bug.
