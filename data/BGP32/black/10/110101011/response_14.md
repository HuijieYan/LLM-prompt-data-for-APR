### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a prefix string based on certain rules involving indentation. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it should wait for a newline character to determine the next action. The identified error points include handling of tabs (`\t`) for indentation and the logic for determining when to wait for a newline.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails when the prefix includes tab characters for indentation. It incorrectly handles the tab character for indentation increase, causing the column count to be incorrect. This leads to the incorrect behavior of adding unnecessary spaces to the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the tab characters for indentation. Adjust the column count correctly for each tab character encountered and ensure that the logic for waiting for a newline and processing lines is correctly implemented.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

            current_line += char

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters for indentation, the corrected version of the function should now process the prefix string correctly, ensuring that the indentation is maintained as expected. This will lead to passing the failing test and resolving the indentation bug reported on GitHub.
