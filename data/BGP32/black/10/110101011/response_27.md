### Bug Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix of characters until a certain column is reached while considering tab and space indentations.
- The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect behavior in cases where comments are not aligned with the code.
- The problem arises from the logic that checks for indentation after encountering a newline character, causing incorrect handling specifically with tab characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and align with the GitHub issue:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle tab and space indentations, ensuring consistent indentation for comments after dedent.
2. Update the logic related to tracking columns and waiting for a newline to accurately capture the indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line.strip())
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust the current column based on the indentation
            current_column = current_column - (len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip()))
            if current_column < 0:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of newline characters and adjusting the column tracking, the corrected function should now properly consume prefixes while maintaining correct indentation for comments after dedent, aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
