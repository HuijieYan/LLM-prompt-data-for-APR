### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function current implementation fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.
2. The function's logic regarding handling indentation levels and waiting for a new line after dedent needs improvement.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights the issue by checking the format equality after processing code with comment indentation using spaces and tabs.
4. The inputs and variables runtime values during tests indicate incorrect handling of new lines and expected column positions.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle the indentation changes, specifically for comments.

### Bug Cause:
The main issue resides in the logic flow related to waiting for a new line after the indentation is finished. The function fails to properly execute this logic, leading to incorrect behavior when processing comments with different levels of indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle the transition after the dedent is finished for comments.
2. Ensure that the indentation levels for comments are preserved based on the surrounding code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # Check and adjust comment indentation
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line, reset the column
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # Indent is finished, wait for a new line
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic to handle new lines and waiting for comments after dedent properly, this corrected version should address the indentation issue when processing comments with different levels accurately.
