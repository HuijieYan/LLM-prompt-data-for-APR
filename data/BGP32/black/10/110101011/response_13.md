### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that is responsible for processing prefix strings.
2. The function seems to have a logic error when handling indentation levels and waiting for newline characters.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function when processing indentation in comments, which is crucial for code formatting.
4. The buggy function incorrectly processes the indentation level of comments after a dedent operation, as reported in the GitHub issue.
   
### Bug Cause:
The function fails to properly handle the indentation level and waiting for newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior with comments and indentation levels after a dedent operation. This results in incorrect code formatting when dealing with tabulated comments after dedenting.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of handling indentation levels, properly wait for newline characters in the correct context, and ensure the correct behavior with comments in various scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # check for unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # indent is finished
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version above, the function should now handle the logic of indentation and waiting for newline characters correctly, resolving the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
