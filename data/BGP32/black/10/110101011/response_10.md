### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to consume a part of the prefix string based on the given column. The function encounters an issue where the indentation is handled incorrectly, especially with comments after a dedent in the input prefix. This behavior leads to incorrect formatting of the code, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location:
The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation in the `elif` condition for handling non-space characters.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided failing test case and runtime values:
- In Case 1, the function incorrectly handles the comment indentation after dedent.
- In Case 3, the logic fails to adjust the current column and processing of non-space characters like tabs.

Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test cases, the bug is due to the incorrect handling of indentation and potential issues with tabulation for comments after dedent.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation when encountering non-space characters like tabs, especially when dealing with comments after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the elif condition to handle both spaces and tabs correctly, the function should now consume the prefix string as intended, addressing the incorrect comment indentation issue described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
