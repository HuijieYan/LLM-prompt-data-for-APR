### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a specific column count is reached, handling different types of characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines while maintaining the correct indentation level.
2. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedentations, as indicated by the failing test case related to comment indentation.
3. The function loses track of the correct indentation level for comments after dedentations, resulting in incorrect formatting.
4. The strategy to fix the bug involves adjusting the logic related to handling comments and maintaining indentation levels after dedentations.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line+'\n')
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = char + (' ' * (column - current_column - 1))
            current_column = column

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

The updated code fixes the bug by ensuring that the correct level of indentation is maintained for comments after dedentations. The fix correctly handles spaces, tabs, and newlines while consuming the prefix until the specified column count is reached.

By applying this fix, the function now correctly handles comment indentation after dedentations, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
