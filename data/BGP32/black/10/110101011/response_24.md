### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached based on indentation rules. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking for correct comment indentation after dedents using tabs and spaces.

The function has several conditional branches based on different characters in the prefix string, managing indentation levels, newline characters, spaces, and tabs. This function is crucial for correctly handling indentation scenarios.

### Identified issue in the buggy function

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the wait_for_nl condition. When encountering a newline character after such condition is set, it fails to properly calculate the indentation. This leads to incorrect indentation adjustments, causing failing tests, particularly when dealing with comments.

### Strategy to fix the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly resets the current_line and current_column variables when waiting for a newline. This reset should reflect the expected behavior for maintaining correct indentation levels, especially after dedents.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""  # Reset current_line on encountering new line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` when encountering a newline outside the wait_for_nl condition, we ensure that the function handles indentation calculations correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test related to comment indentation issues.
