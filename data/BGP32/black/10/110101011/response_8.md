### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process prefix characters based on specific conditions like spaces, tabs, and newlines to maintain proper indentation.
2. The function is failing to correctly handle cases where comments are involved, which is why the failing test for comment indentation is not passing.
3. The primary issue lies in how the function handles newline characters and waits for a newline after encountering indent characters like tabs or spaces.
4. The function needs adjustment in the logic related to handling comments, ensuring they are appropriately aligned after indentation changes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly handle comments that should maintain their indentation level after dedent. When encountering a newline after comments, the function incorrectly resets the current column value, leading to incorrect comment alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to how comments are processed within the function. Specifically, we should ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation alignment after dedent operations. By modifying the handling of newline characters and comments, we can address the issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):  # Check for comments
                current_column = column  # Maintain comment alignment
            else:
                current_column = 0  # Reset for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the highlighted modifications to handle comments appropriately, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly preserve the alignment of comments during indentation changes, resolving the bug.
