### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix text until a certain column width is reached. It processes characters within the prefix based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
2. The bug seems to occur when trying to correctly consume the prefix text and handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent operation.
3. The function fails to handle the scenario where a comment is encountered after a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation for these comments after transformation.
4. To fix this bug, the handling of comments after a dedent operation needs to be adjusted to maintain proper indentation.
5. The corrected version of the function should correctly handle these cases to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Introduce a flag to track the presence of a dedent operation.
2. Adjust the logic to handle comments specifically after a dedent, maintaining the correct indentation level.
3. Ensure that the handling of newline characters, tabs, spaces, and comments is correctly managed to consume the prefix text accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        after_dedent = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.lstrip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    after_dedent = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column == 0 and not after_dedent:
                    # Dedent operation
                    after_dedent = True
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the adjustments above, the corrected function should be able to correctly handle the indentation for comments after dedent operations, resolving the bug and passing the failing test case related to comment indentation.
