### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value.
2. The function processes characters one by one, adjusting the current line and column values accordingly.
3. The bug seems to occur when processing newline characters and handling comments.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the formatting of code with comments under different scenarios.
5. The GitHub issue indicates a specific problem with indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
   
### Bug Cause:
- The issue arises in the case of tabulated comments. The function does not handle the correct indentation for comments after dedenting.
- The function is not correctly updating the `current_line` and `current_column` values for tabs and comments, leading to incorrect output.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic for handling tabulated comments to ensure correct indentation after a dedent operation.
- Update the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tabs and newline characters.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if wait_for_nl:  # Adjust column value for tabulated comments
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:  # Adjust column value for tabulated comments
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic inside the function to handle tabulated comments correctly, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
