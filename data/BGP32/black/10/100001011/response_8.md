### Bug Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle the consumed and unconsumed parts of a prefix string based on the given column indentation. However, it fails to correctly handle tabs for indentation, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Potential Error Locations
- The handling of tabs (char == '\t') may not properly increment the current_column by the necessary amount (4 spaces per tab).
- The logic for deciding when to wait for a newline character (wait_for_nl) and handling comments may be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The buggy function fails to properly account for the correct indentation when a tab is encountered, leading to misalignment in the output. This issue is related to handling tab characters (char == '\t') where the current_column calculation is insufficient, causing incorrect behavior with column-aligned comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic for tab character handling to correctly increment the current_column by 4 spaces instead of just 1.
2. Ensure that the transition to waiting for a newline character and handling comments is appropriately triggered based on the indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tab characters and adjusting the logic for indentation and comment handling, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the expected behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent.
