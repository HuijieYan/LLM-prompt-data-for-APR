### Bug Analysis:
- The `partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume the initial whitespace characters in a prefix string up to a specified column.
- The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation for lines with comments after a dedent, particularly when tab characters are used.
- The issue from GitHub highlights the problem with incorrect indentation changes after a dedent when processing tabulated comments.
- The function fails to properly handle tab characters and whitespace indentation when determining the prefix string to consume.

### Bug Location:
- The bug is likely located in the `elif char == '\t':` block where tab characters are processed.
- Improper handling of tab characters causes the issues with determining the correct indentation level.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of tab characters when calculating the current column position.
- As a result, the function fails to correctly detect the presence of additional whitespace characters in lines with comments after a dedent.
- This leads to the incorrect consumption of prefix characters and misaligned indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of tab characters and accurately calculate the column position in the prefix string.
- Adjust the logic for tab characters to correctly increment the column position by the equivalent number of spaces.
- Update the condition for determining when to wait for a new line based on the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Increment column position for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function includes adjustments to handle tab characters properly and calculate the column position accurately.
- By updating the logic for tab character processing and indentation level detection, the function should now correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column position.
