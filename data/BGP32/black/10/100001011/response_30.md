### Analyzing the buggy function:

The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a given prefix until a specific column is reached, handling indentation of spaces and tabs. The primary issues occur when the function encounters '\n' characters, which mark the end of a line.

### Identified bug:
The bug appears to be related to how the function handles the transition from one line to the next when encountering a newline character. When the function encounters '\n', it resets the current column to 0, which causes inconsistencies with column tracking and indentation levels.

### Bug cause:
The issue arises because the logic for handling newlines is resetting the column count but failing to update the `lines` list correctly. This leads to incorrect line breaks and problems with tracking the proper indentation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `lines` list is updated correctly whenever a newline character is encountered. We should also adjust the column count according to the indentation level. Additionally, the implementation should handle possible corner cases, such as empty lines.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring that the `lines` list is updated correctly at each newline character, the function should now properly handle the indentation levels and line breaks. This correction should address the bug related to the incorrect indentation behavior after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.
