The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to handling tab characters and tracking the correct column positions for indentation. The function is not properly accounting for the tab characters when calculating the column positions, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering tabs in the prefix.

The issue on GitHub also highlights a similar problem with incorrect indentation related to tabs. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that tab characters are properly handled when calculating column positions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column by replacing tabs with spaces
            current_column += 4
            # Calculate remaining spaces for alignment
            tab_size = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * tab_size
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added a section to handle tab characters. By converting tabs to spaces and adjusting the `current_column` value appropriately, the function can now correctly handle indentation levels, especially when tabs are present in the input prefix. This fix should address the bug and align with the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
