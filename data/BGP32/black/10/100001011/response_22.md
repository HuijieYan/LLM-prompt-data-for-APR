### Bug Explanation:
The bug is related to the incorrect handling of comments and indentation levels when the code includes tabs. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` intended to handle prefix consumption up to a certain column, considering different whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines. However, the bug arises when a tab character is encountered, causing incorrect calculations for the current column and leading to faulty behavior in updating the `lines`, `current_line`, and `current_column` variables.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters in the prefix input correctly. The incorrect increment of `current_column` when encountering a tab leads to incorrect line formation. We should update the logic to handle tabs properly and update the `current_column` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl or char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, tab characters are appropriately handled, balancing the indentation levels according to the number of spaces to reach the next multiple of 4 and updating the `current_column` accordingly. This adjustment ensures the correct formation of lines and addresses the bug related to wrong behavior when encountering tab characters in the prefix input.
