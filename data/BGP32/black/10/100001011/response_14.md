### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle consuming a prefix string up to a specified column, considering indentation spaces and tabs. The function aims to return the consumed lines up to the column, along with the remaining part of the input prefix.

The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent operation. This indicates that there is a problem with how tabs and spaces are treated, specifically when encountering a newline character that follows a tab.

### Bug Cause:
By analyzing the given runtime values and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to stem from the incorrect increment of `current_column` when encountering a newline character following a tab character. The issue in the reported test cases suggests that comments following tabs are not correctly aligned after a dedent operation.

In the provided bug cases, `current_column` is not properly updated when a newline character is encountered after a tab. This leads to incorrect alignment and causes the noted indentation issue in the GitHub report.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the increment of `current_column` when dealing with tab characters and newlines. Specifically, the function should ensure that the tab character increments `current_column` by 4, and a newline character resets `current_column` to 0. This adjustment will align the comments correctly with the subsequent lines after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of tab characters and newline characters in the function, the comments alignment issue after a dedent operation should be resolved. This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is updated correctly based on the different indentation characters, aligning the comments as expected.
