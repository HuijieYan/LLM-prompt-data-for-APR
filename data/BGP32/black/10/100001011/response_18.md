### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing whitespace characters before the code starts. The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect indentation for comments with tabs.

### Error Locations:
1. The function incorrectly handles tab characters, adding only 4 to `current_column` instead of the appropriate tab width.
2. The function might be incorrectly checking for the indentation level against the specified `column`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle tabs correctly, which leads to incorrect comparison with the specified `column`. This mismatch causes the function to misinterpret the actual indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly handle tabs by adjusting the `current_column` based on the tab width.
2. Ensure that the function compares the correct indentation level based on the specified `column` value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    tab_width = 4  # Define tab width
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column based on tab width
            current_column = (current_column // tab_width + 1) * tab_width
        else:
            # Increment column based on other characters
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By incorporating the appropriate tab width handling and ensuring correct indentation level comparison, the corrected version of the function should now address the bug reported on GitHub.
