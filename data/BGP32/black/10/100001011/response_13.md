### Bug Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters until a specific column limit is reached. However, there seems to be an issue with handling tab characters and their corresponding indentation levels. The function doesn't account for the correct behavior when encountering tab characters regarding column counting and line splitting.

### Error Locations
1. Improper handling of tab characters in calculating the current column.
2. Failure to adjust the column count based on the tab spacing.
3. Incorrect logic for splitting lines and checking the column condition.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to the function not correctly processing tab characters. When encountering a tab character, the function increments the column count by a fixed value of 4, which is incorrect. This leads to misaligned indentation and incorrect line splitting, ultimately causing the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the logic related to handling tab characters to adjust the column count based on the actual tab spacing.
2. Ensure that the current column is correctly updated when encountering tab characters to maintain accurate tracking of indentation levels.
3. Refactor the line splitting logic to handle tabs and spaces appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Adjust the column count based on tab spacing
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made
1. Updated the column count handling when encountering tab characters to align with the actual tab spacing.
2. Adjusted the logic for updating the current column when processing different types of characters.
3. Improved the line splitting mechanism to correctly handle both tab and space characters.
