### Error Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation level and updating the current line when encountering '\n'. This leads to incorrect indentation in the output when tabs are used in the input.

In Case 1, the function fails to update the lines correctly when encountering a new line. The code intended to handle the indentation level and the buffer line does not reset as expected. This issue causes incorrect processing as also verified from the GitHub issue where incorrect handling of tabs leads to misaligned comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to occur in the logic surrounding the handling of new lines ('\n') and updating the current line buffer. The line resetting mechanism is flawed, leading to incorrect indentation processing, especially when dealing with tabs as shown in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for handling new lines and indentation resetting works correctly. Adjust the code to correctly update the lines based on indentation and handle tabs appropriately to resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making the necessary adjustments in the function, it should now handle the indentation correctly, especially when dealing with tabs as highlighted in the provided GitHub issue.
