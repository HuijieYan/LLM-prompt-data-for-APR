### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on a specified column value. However, based on the runtime values and types provided, we see that the function is not handling the indentation correctly for tabulated comments. This bug results in incorrect indentation after a dedent operation.

Looking at the provided cases and the GitHub issue, we identify the following potential issues in the buggy function:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') causing the current_column to be updated incorrectly.
2. Inconsistent logic for tracking the indentation level and waiting for a newline character.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not account for tab characters when updating the current_column value. This causes incorrect indentation levels to be tracked, leading to the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the reported issue, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters ('\t') properly. Specifically, we should ensure that the current_column is incremented by 4 (in this case) for every tab character encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is provided below:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_column += 1

        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incrementing the `current_column` correctly for tab characters and adjusting the logic surrounding indentation tracking, this corrected version of the function should now handle tabulated comments and correctly consume the prefix based on the specified column value. This fix should resolve the indentation issue reported in the GitHub problem.
