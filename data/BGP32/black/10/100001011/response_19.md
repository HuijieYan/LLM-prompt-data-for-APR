### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume the prefix until a specific column or end of line, based on indentation rules.
2. The function uses a loop to iterate over each character in the prefix and handle different cases like spaces, tabs, and new lines.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the indentation correctly, especially when encountering newlines and tabs.
4. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` seems to be incorrect, causing the function to return an incorrect result in some scenarios.
5. The bug is leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabs and newlines in prefix indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column `, as it incorrectly checks the strip of the `current_line` which may remove necessary spaces or tabs for correct indentation. This condition leads to premature returning of the result, not considering the complete prefix.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
The fix should involve reevaluating how the function handles newline characters, tabs, and spaces while tracking the indentation level correctly. The condition for returning the result should be revised to ensure the complete prefix is consumed until the specified column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.rstrip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tabs to increment the `current_column` by multiples of 4 spaces effectively without distorting the indentation. The condition for returning the result now uses `current_line.rstrip()` to preserve indentation levels accurately.
