### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is aimed at consuming a given prefix string up to a specified column, preserving line breaks and indentation. However, the function fails to handle cases involving indentation levels correctly, especially when dealing with tabs and multiple lines.

Based on the runtime values and current state of variables in the failing cases, we can see that the function struggles with correctly tracking the indentation levels and handling the wait-for-new-line logic.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 1, when encountering a new line character ('\n'), it incorrectly increments the `current_column` to 0, leading to a wrong calculation.
2. In Case 3, the function fails to properly handle tabs, resulting in an inconsistent indentation level calculation and the premature addition of lines to the list.
3. In general, the implementation of the logic to track indentation levels and line breaks is flawed, leading to incorrect parsing of the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the current indentation level and handle different types of whitespace characters like tabs and spaces. Additionally, the logic for waiting for a new line should be improved to handle multiple lines and maintain correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab is considered as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function includes a better handling of indentation levels, whitespace characters, line breaks, and the logic for waiting for a new line. This should address the reported bug and improve the overall functionality.
