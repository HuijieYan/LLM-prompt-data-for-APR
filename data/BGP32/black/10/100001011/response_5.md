## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises due to incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering tab characters (`\t`). This results in incorrect behavior, especially in scenarios where indentation levels need to be maintained correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the indentation level accordingly. Specifically, when encountering a tab character, the function should increment the `current_column` by 1 (to represent the single character `'\t'`) instead of directly adding 4. Additionally, we need to reevaluate the logic related to the `wait_for_nl` flag to ensure proper handling of line breaks.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Adjust for tab character to increment by 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic for handling tab characters and improving the logic for the `wait_for_nl` flag, the corrected function should now properly maintain the desired indentation levels.
