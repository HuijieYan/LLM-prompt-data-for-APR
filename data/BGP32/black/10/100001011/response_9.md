## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of tabs when tracking and adjusting the current column position. The function is designed to consume a prefix up to a certain column, but it miscalculates the effect of tabs on the column position. This leads to incorrect indentation behavior, particularly with comments after dedents, as reported in the GitHub issue.

In the provided buggy function:
1. The `current_column` is incremented by a fixed amount when encountering a tab character, which should actually depend on the current column position relative to tab stops.
2. The function does not properly adjust the `current_column` and \wait_for_nl` flag when processing tab characters, leading to the incorrect preservation of indentation levels.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters in the function. The function should increment the `current_column` based on the distance to the next tab stop, rather than a fixed amount. Additionally, proper handling of tabs is necessary to update the column position correctly.

## Corrected Version

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # Define the tab size
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
            current_line += ' ' * tab_width
            current_column += tab_width
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                # Reset the current column to handle the next indentation level correctly
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters and updating the current column position correctly, this corrected version should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
