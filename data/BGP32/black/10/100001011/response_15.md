### Bug Explanation
The `partially_consume_prefix` function aims to consume and differentiate tabulated indentation and spaces in a prefix to properly format code. However, the function fails to accurately handle tabulated indentations, leading to incorrect line spacing and indentation changes, especially after dedenting. The function's logic regarding tabs and spacing computation is flawed, resulting in the incorrect handling of comments and indentation levels, as evident from the GitHub issue provided.

### Bug Fixes Strategy
To resolve this bug, the function's handling of tabulated indentation needs significant improvement. Specifically, the computation of `current_column` and differentiation between tab and space characters require revision. The essential modifications involve correctly calculating column positions for both tabs and spaces and adjusting the logic to preserve correct indentation after dedents and comments.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, addressing the bug described:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tabs, spaces, and newline characters to accurately compute line indentation levels and alignment within the prefix. By addressing the indentation computation flaws, this revision should mitigate the reported issue with incorrect tabulated indentation changes, especially after dedenting in the codebase provided in the GitHub issue.
