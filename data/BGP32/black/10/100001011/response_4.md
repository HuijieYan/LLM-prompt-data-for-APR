### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle prefix text based on indentation levels defined by spaces, tabs, and newline characters. However, it fails to correctly adjust the column count for tab characters, leading to incorrect behavior with tabulated comments.

In the provided runtime cases:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly counts a tab character as a single column, whereas it should add 4 to `current_column`.
2. In Case 3, the function mishandles the tab character and does not update the `current_column` appropriately.

The bug arises from the function's failure to consider tabs when calculating the column position, resulting in misaligned text with tabulated comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` should accurately handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` accordingly when encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the adjustment for tab characters as shown in the corrected function, the bug related to misaligned tabulated comments should be resolved. This correction aligns with the information provided in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation with tab characters.
