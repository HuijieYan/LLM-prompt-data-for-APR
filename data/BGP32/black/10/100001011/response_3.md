### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain indentation column level. However, it has a bug where it does not handle tab characters correctly, causing issues with the indentation level. The bug is related to how the function calculates the indentation based on spaces and tabs differently.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character (`'\t'`). The function increments the `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, but this calculation is incorrect compared to a single space character being one unit of indentation. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles tab characters for calculating the current column indentation correctly. We should consider a tab character equivalent to increasing the `current_column` by a number of spaces to ensure consistent indentation handling.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    TAB_WIDTH = 4  # Define the width of a tab character
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            num_spaces = TAB_WIDTH - (current_column % TAB_WIDTH)
            current_line += ' ' * num_spaces
            current_column += num_spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making the above adjustments, the function now correctly handles tab characters and calculates the column indentation based on the defined tab width. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation after dedent for tabulated comments.
