### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is aimed at handling indentation levels in a prefix string. However, the issue arises when dealing with tabs and spaces mixed in the prefix string. In the provided cases and the GitHub issue, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation, especially for comments after a dedent with tabs involved.

### Error Locations:
1. The function fails to properly reset `current_column` when encountering a newline character.
2. The conditional check for `if char == ' ':` only increments `current_column` by 1 instead of resetting it as well.

### Cause of the Bug:
The main cause of this bug is the improper handling of the `current_column` variable, especially when dealing with a mix of tabs and spaces for indentation. This leads to the incorrect calculation of column positions and results in misaligned comments, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. Update the conditional check for space characters to reset `current_column` to properly handle spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column = 0  # Reset to 0 for space to handle indentation
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column + 4) // 4) * 4  # Updated tab handling
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column position for newline character
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_column` correctly for different cases, specifically handling spaces and tabs, the corrected function should address the indentation issues highlighted in the GitHub issue and the failing test cases provided.
