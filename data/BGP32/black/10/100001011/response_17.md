### Bug Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle indentation changes in code.
- The function accumulates characters until encountering a newline character (`'\n'`) or spaces/tabs that go beyond the specified `column`, then it returns the consumed characters as `res` and the remaining prefix characters.
- The bug likely causes indentation changes incorrectly when tabs are involved due to improper handling of tab characters in calculating the current column position.

### Error Locations:
1. The handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) in adjusting the `current_column`.
2. Issue with recognizing when to process the current line as the indentation is finished.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug stems from not correctly accounting for tab characters in updating the `current_column` and not properly detecting the end of the indentation segment marked by a newline character.
- Since Case 3 includes a tab character in the prefix, the incorrect calculation of column position and premature resetting of line indentation lead to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly reflect indentation.
2. Adjust the condition for identifying the end of the indentation to wait until encountering a newline character.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust column for tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tab characters and improving the logic for detecting the end of indentation, the bug should be resolved, preventing incorrect indentation changes especially when dealing with tabulations.
