### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation in Python code by consuming the prefix until a specific column position is reached. However, based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, it is evident that the function is not correctly handling newline characters and updating the indentation level. This leads to incorrect behavior, especially when dealing with tab characters in the prefix.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function does not handle newline characters correctly when calculating the current column position.
2. The function fails to handle tab characters accurately, causing issues with the indentation level.
3. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to check indentation levels is not accounting for tab characters correctly.

### Bug Fix:
1. Update the current_column calculation to accurately handle all whitespace characters, including tabs.
2. Adjust the condition to check indentation levels correctly considering tab characters.
3. Modify the logic related to newline characters to ensure that the current_column is reset appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the tab increment to 4 to match the standard Python behavior
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current_column to 0 for a new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Change the logic to handle different whitespace characters correctly
            if char.isspace():
                # Increment based on the actual white space length
                current_column += len(char)
            else:
                # If not whitespace character, indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these modifications to the function, the issue related to incorrect indentation handling, especially with tabs, should be resolved based on the provided GitHub issue information.
