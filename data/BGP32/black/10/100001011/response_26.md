### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to process a prefix string up to a certain column, excluding any indentation, for indent-related operations. The bug appears to be related to handling tabs and spaces in a consistent manner, leading to incorrect calculations of the column position.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tabs and spaces affecting the `current_column` calculation.
2. Inconsistent resetting of `current_column` after encountering a new line.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of tabs and spaces. The function incorrectly updates the `current_column` value based on spaces and tabs encountered in the `prefix` string. This causes misaligned columns when tabs are present, affecting the intended behavior of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Normalize the handling of tabs and spaces to determine the actual column position consistently.
2. Ensure that `current_column` is correctly reset when encountering a new line to maintain accurate tracking of the column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4-space tab size
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of tabs and spaces to accurately determine the column position. It also correctly resets `current_column` when encountering a new line within the prefix string.
