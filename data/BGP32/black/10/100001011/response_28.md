### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of characters until a certain column length is reached and return the consumed characters along with the remaining ones.
- The function seems to have issues with handling spaces, tabs, and newlines correctly to maintain the indentation structure.
- The function is not correctly updating the current_column value in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function fails to update the `current_column` value correctly after encountering a newline character, resulting in incorrect indentation handling.
- The `current_column` value should be reset to `0` after encountering a newline character to correctly handle the next line's indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the `current_column` value is updated correctly for each type of character to maintain proper tracking of indentation.
- Reset the `current_column` value to `0` when encountering a newline character to handle indentation in subsequent lines effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res)+1:]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column for new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
- Added a line to reset `current_column` to `0` when encountering a newline character to handle subsequent indentation correctly.
- Adjusted the `return` statement to ensure that the consumed prefix does not include the newline character to maintain correct behavior. 

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of the input prefix and return the expected results, addressing the issue described in the GitHub report.
