### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a specified column in the context of code formatting. The main issue here seems to be the incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments when tabs are used. This problem aligns with the GitHub issue where the indentation for comments gets altered after a dedent operation. The function's behavior is causing inconsistent indentation levels for comments, likely due to the improper tracking of columns and line breaks.

### Error Locations
1. Inconsistent column tracking, especially with tabs
2. Incorrect handling of whitespace characters

### Bug Cause
The bug arises when the function encounters tab characters and spaces while trying to calculate the correct indentation level. This leads to incorrect column numbers, resulting in misaligned comments after dedent operations. The faulty logic in managing tabs and spaces causes the unexpected behavior observed in the failing tests and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the column layout with regard to tabs and spaces, ensuring proper alignment of comments after any dedent operations. This involves adjusting the logic related to column tracking and whitespace handling while iterating through the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the handling of tabs has been adjusted to ensure that the column number is properly calculated irrespective of the characters present. This will help in maintaining consistent indentation levels, fixing the issue reported in the GitHub thread related to tabulated comments after a dedent.
