## Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a specific column is reached, handling tabulated and space characters for indentation.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and space characters for indentation after dedent.
3. From the provided runtime values, it can be observed that when a tab character is encountered, the `current_column` is not appropriately updated, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. The function should properly handle tab characters for indentations and ensure that the column count is adjusted accordingly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tab characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering a tab character, the function should update the `current_column` by 4 as per the standard tab width. However, in the existing implementation, when a tab character is encountered, the `current_column` is not properly updated, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle tab characters for indentation by incrementing the `current_column` by the appropriate amount (4 for tab characters).
2. Ensure that the functionality for tab characters aligns with the intended behavior of the function in terms of indentation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update for correct tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to appropriately handle tab characters for indentation by incrementing the `current_column` by 4, the corrected version should resolve the issue and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
