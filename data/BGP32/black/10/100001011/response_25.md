### Problem Identification
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to process a given prefix string based on a specified column. However, there is a bug in the logic, specifically with the handling of indentation levels in the presence of tabs. The issue arises when the function encounters a tab character and tries to adjust the `current_column` value. This misalignment causes the incorrect processing of the input prefix string leading to the reported formatting issue on GitHub.

### Bug Cause
The bug primarily stems from the incorrect handling of tab characters when calculating the `current_column` value. In the buggy function:
- When encountering a tab character (`'\t'`), the `current_column` value is incremented by 4. This approach is fundamentally flawed as tabs are not equivalent to four spaces.
  
The flawed logic results in misalignment with actual indentation levels, leading to incorrect processing of the input prefix. This misalignment causes formatting issues as reported on GitHub, especially when dealing with tab-indented content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and align the function's behavior with tab usage as reported in the GitHub issue, the handling of tab characters needs correction. Avoid incrementing the `current_column` by a fixed amount but rather adjust it based on the actual tab width convention, usually being 8 characters. By addressing this specific issue, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function will accurately process the prefix string regardless of tab or space indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    tab_width = 8  # Assuming default tab width of 8 characters
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1  # Increment by 1 for each space character
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column based on tab width convention
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the function appropriately handles tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` value based on the tab width (default 8 characters). This modification ensures consistent and accurate processing of the input prefix string, resolving the reported formatting issue on GitHub related to incorrect indentation changes after dedents when tabs are used.
