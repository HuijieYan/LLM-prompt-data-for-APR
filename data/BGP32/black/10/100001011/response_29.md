### Bug Explanation
The issue arises from the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation levels of comments after dedent operations. The function is designed to process the input prefix and adjust the lines and columns based on whitespace characters. However, the logic for handling tabs and spaces is flawed, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation, especially when tabs are involved.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address this issue effectively, the function needs to properly handle tabs (\t) and spaces ( ' ') when calculating the indentation levels. Adjustments should be made to ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation levels even after dedents. The function should be modified to correctly track the whitespace characters and adjust the columns accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Bug Fix Details
1. Changed the logic to handle tabs (\t) correctly by incrementing the current_column by 4 minus the current_column modulo 4. This adjustment ensures consistent tab handling across different indentation levels.
2. Adjusted the handling of spaces (' ') to increase the current_column by 1, maintaining proper whitespace detection.
3. Modified the else clause to trigger wait_for_nl when encountering any character other than tabs, spaces, or newline characters, signaling the end of the current indentation.

By applying these modifications, the corrected version of the function addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
