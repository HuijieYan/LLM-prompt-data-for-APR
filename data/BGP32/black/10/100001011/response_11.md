### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle the indentation levels of a given prefix string based on certain rules. The issue arises when dealing with tab characters `\t` and determining the correct column number based on them. The function encounters problems when the prefix string contains a mix of spaces and tabs which leads to incorrect indentation calculation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Case 1:**
   - In this case, the function fails to correctly handle the tab character `\t`. The `current_column` value is not incremented by the expected amount for a tab, thus leading to incorrect column calculations.

2. **Case 2:**
   - Here, with an empty prefix string, the function does not reset the `current_column` value to 0 as expected, causing potential issues in subsequent calculations.

3. **Case 3:**
   - Similar to Case 1, the function miscalculates the column position when encountering a tab character, resulting in incorrect indentation levels.

4. **Case 4:**
   - This case represents an instance where the function fails to reset the `current_column` value to 0 upon encountering a new line character, potentially causing issues when continuing the prefix string processing.

5. **Case 5:**
   - The mixing of spaces and tabs in the input prefix leads to incorrect column calculations, especially with the presence of a tab character in the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the tab indentation calculation issues caused by a mix of spaces and tabs, a revised approach is needed to accurately track the column position based on both spaces and tab characters in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the updated and corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised version adjusts how the `current_column` is updated when encountering tab characters, ensuring that the correct indentation is maintained regardless of the mix of spaces and tabs in the prefix string.
