### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, considering indentation levels. However, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation for the given cases. The bug is related to how the function processes spaces, tabs, and newlines in the prefix string.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of newline characters and column tracking.
2. Misinterpretation of the indentation level when processing spaces and tabs.
3. Failure to update the current_line and current_column variables properly.
4. Flawed logic for switching between wait_for_nl state and consuming indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is the mishandling of newline characters and indentation levels in the prefix string. The code wrongly increments the current_column variable when encountering spaces or tabs, without properly accounting for the actual indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the column position based on the actual indentation level, accounting for spaces, tabs, and newline characters. Properly updating the current_line and current_column variables will help accurately consume the prefix string up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Bug Fix Explanation:
1. Adjusted the handling of tabs to correctly increment the current_column according to the actual tabulation level.
2. Added a check to correctly handle newline characters and return results based on the current column position.
3. Updated the indentation detection logic to switch between wait_for_nl state and consume indentation appropriately.

By implementing these corrections, the function should now accurately consume the prefix string up to the specified column without erroneously modifying the indentation level.
