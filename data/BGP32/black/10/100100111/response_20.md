### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached.
2. The function keeps track of the current line being constructed, the current column position, and the need to wait for a new line character before updating the column position.
3. The function encounters issues with handling tab characters and giving incorrect indentation after dedent operations resulting in comments being incorrectly aligned.
4. The failing test cases highlight the incorrect behavior of the function when handling different input scenarios with comments and tab/space indentation mismatches.

### Error Location:
1. The function encounters problems when handling tab characters and calculating the column position based on the given rules.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly handles tab characters by incrementing the column position by a fixed value of 4, which doesn't align with the actual tab width.
2. This incorrect handling of tab characters leads to errors in tracking and adjusting the indentation level, causing the comments to be improperly indented after dedent operations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to increment the column position correctly based on the actual tab width.
2. Ensure that the function adjusts the column position and indentation level accurately to maintain correct alignment, especially for comments after dedent operations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_distance = 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Calculate the remaining spaces to reach the next tab stop
            current_line += ' ' * tab_distance
            current_column += tab_distance
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrected logic for handling tab characters and adjusting the column position accurately, the updated function should now correctly consume the prefix string in a way that maintains proper alignment and indentation levels.
