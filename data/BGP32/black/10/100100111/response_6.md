### Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle prefix consumption until a specific column limit is reached. The bug seems to stem from the mismanagement of indentation levels and the handling of different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) within the prefix.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Mishandling of indentation levels and their conversions.
2. Inaccurate tracking of the current position in terms of columns.
3. Inconsistent behavior when encountering different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines).

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test case, the function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level of the comment as expected after encountering a newline. This results in incorrect indentation of the comment relative to the following line.
2. The buggy function does not accurately handle the scenario of encountering a newline character after consuming characters with spaces or tabs. It fails to reset the current column position.
3. The function's logic for managing different character types (spaces, tabs) might be flawed, leading to inconsistent behavior when calculating the current column position.

### Fix Strategy
1. Correctly adjust the indentation level of comments after encountering a newline to match the following line.
2. Ensure that the current column position is reset appropriately when encountering a newline character after consuming other types of characters.
3. Modify the logic for handling different character types to accurately track the current position while considering tabs and spaces differently.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl and len(current_line) - 1 >= column:
            break

    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
``` 

This corrected version should properly handle various scenarios and address the issues identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue related to indentation problems.
