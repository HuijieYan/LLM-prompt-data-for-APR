### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is meant to partially consume a given prefix string up to a certain column, handling different types of indentation characters. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation after dedented lines with comments.

### Error Locations
1. The `elif char == '\n':` block does not reset `wait_for_nl` and only resets `current_column`. This causes unexpected behavior when encountering newlines.
2. The logic for handling whitespace characters (`' '` and `'\t'`) needs to be adjusted to accurately track the current column.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the function does not correctly handle the indentation level after encountering a newline character that does not match the expected column. This leads to incorrect indentation behavior, as observed in the failing test case. The handling of different types of whitespace characters is also not precise, leading to calculation errors in the column count.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that `wait_for_nl` is reset correctly when encountering newlines.
2. Revise the logic for updating `current_column` when encountering different types of whitespace characters to accurately track the column position.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in [' ', '\t']:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset current_column and wait_for_nl
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `wait_for_nl` and properly updating `current_column` for different types of whitespace characters, this corrected version of the function should handle the indentation logic correctly and pass the failing test case.
