### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix based on a specified column value.
- The function tracks lines, the current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle different types of characters.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent process.

### Identified Errors:
1. The issue arises when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set on encountering a non-whitespace character, thereby altering the comment's indentation.
2. The function fails to handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect column tracking.

### Bug Cause:
- When encountering a non-whitespace character after reaching the specified column depth, the function sets `wait_for_nl` to True, assuming this is the end of the current indentation block. However, this logic is flawed, especially when handling comments after a dedent operation.
- Tab characters are treated inconsistently, resulting in incorrect column calculations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Revisit the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` to avoid prematurely finalizing the current line.
2. Ensure proper handling of tab characters to maintain accurate column counts.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle comments after dedent operations and manage tab characters for accurate column tracking.
