### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume part of a prefix based on indentation. The bug seems to be related to the handling of tab characters and the calculation of indentation levels. This is important because the incorrect calculation affects how comments are indented.

### Error Location:
The issue appears to be related to how tab characters are handled and the calculation of the indentation level in the `elif char == '\t':` block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes incorrect behavior when a comment follows an indented block that uses tabs. This results in the comment being improperly indented in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The fix should involve correctly calculating the column position when encountering tab characters and ensuring that comments are properly indented based on the preceding code block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BuggyFixer:
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making modifications to correctly handle tab characters and adjusting the column calculation, this corrected version should resolve the bug without impacting the expected functionality for other scenarios.
