### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation and consuming part of the prefix based on the provided column.
2. The function encounters issues when dealing with spaces, tabs, and new lines, impacting the column count and prefix consumption.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` validates the function's behavior when dealing with indentation in comments.
4. The expected output values are specified for different scenarios to identify the discrepancies in the function's logic.
5. The GitHub issue highlights a problem with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when dealing with tabulated input.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises due to incorrect handling of new lines and indentations in the function. When encountering certain characters like spaces, tabs, and new lines, the function's logic for updating the current column count and consuming the prefix is flawed. This leads to incorrect indentation, especially in cases where comments are involved after a dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle new lines and indentations. Correctly updating the current column count and consuming the prefix based on the provided column value will ensure that the expected indentation is maintained. Additionally, adjusting the logic for comment lines and dedents will help resolve the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic flow and handling new lines correctly, the corrected function should now maintain the expected indentation levels and consume the prefix accurately. This revised version ensures that the function behaves as intended and addresses the bug identified in the failing test and GitHub issue.
