### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, preserving the line breaks and counting indentation levels. The issue arises when encountering comments preceded by a dedent. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for these comments when mixing tabs and spaces.

### Error Locations:
1. Inconsistent handling of tab and space characters causing incorrect column count.
2. Incorrect resetting of `current_column` when encountering a newline character after dedent.
3. Insufficient tracking of lines and their indentation levels.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of tab and space characters affecting the column count. After dedent, the current line's indentation is not properly reset, leading to incorrect indentation levels for subsequent comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the character count for tabs and spaces consistently to calculate the correct column.
2. Reset the `current_column` appropriately when encountering a newline character after dedent.
3. Ensure proper preservation of lines and their respective indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_line = current_line.strip()
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By applying these corrections in the function, the indentation issue for tabulated comments after a dedent should be resolved.
