### Analysis:
1. The `buggy` function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume the prefix text until a certain column limit based on indentation, specifically handling spaces, tabs, and new lines.
2. The function has logic to track the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line when indent finishes.
3. The bug seems to be related to improper handling of indentation and comments, resulting in incorrect behavior when dedenting.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` expects correct indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
5. The provided expected variable values help in understanding the correct behavior for different scenarios.

### Error and Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs when the function encounters a new line after an indent, and it fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments that should align with the next line.
2. The function wrongly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` when encountering a non-tab, non-space character after an indent.
3. This incorrect flagging results in incorrect indenting for comments after dedenting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the wait condition for a new line, ensuring that comments maintain the correct alignment.
2. Adjust the handling of spaces, tabs, and new lines to address the specific issue mentioned in the failing test case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == "\n":
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = "".join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = "".join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

            if char == " ":
                current_column += 1
            elif char == "\t":
                current_column += 4
            current_line += char

    return "".join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected function above addresses the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after dedenting. By adjusting the control flow and handling of different characters, the function should now correctly maintain the expected indentation alignment for comments after an indent operation.
