### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to handle indentation in the given prefix string based on a specified column. The bug seems to be related to how it handles tabs and spaces in the prefix string.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tab characters causing incorrect indentation.
2. Incorrect updating of `current_column` when encountering newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by treating tab characters inconsistently with spaces when updating the `current_column`. This leads to incorrect indentation levels when recovering lines.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to align with space characters.
2. Ensure `current_column` is updated correctly when encountering newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update to align with space characters
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these fixes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle both tab and space characters correctly, ensuring proper indentation recovery. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
