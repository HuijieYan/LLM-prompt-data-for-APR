### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix string based on a provided column value. It processes each character of the prefix string and adjusts the current line, current column, and waits for a new line based on '\n', space, or tab characters.

### Issues:
1. The indentation handling seems incorrect, especially after dedenting and encountering comments.
2. The logic for tracking column and indentation levels may be faulty.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly identify the comment indentation level.
2. Ensure that tabs are handled properly in all cases.
3. Revisit the indentation tracking to reflect the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                indent = current_line.expandtabs(4)
                if current_line.strip() and len(indent) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8  # Assuming each tab equals 4 spaces

        elif char == '\n':
            indent = current_line.expandtabs(4)
            if not indent.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tabs, adjusting the logic for identifying column indentation, and considering the behavior of comments and new lines, the corrected function should now satisfy the test cases and address the reported GitHub issue.
