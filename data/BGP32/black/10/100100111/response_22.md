### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. The function has issues with handling tab and space characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation. This bug is related to an issue on GitHub where incorrect comment indentation occurs for tabulated content. 

### Identified errors
1. Incorrect handling of tab and space characters in the calculation of `current_column`.
2. Incorrect return values when encountering newline characters causing inappropriate indentation for comments.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` arises due to the mishandling of tab ('\t') and space (' ') characters when calculating the `current_column` value. This incorrect computation leads to misalignment when dealing with comment lines.

### Strategy for Bug Fix
1. Adjust the calculation of the `current_column` based on the character encountered in the prefix.
2. Update the logic for identifying the start of the comment line to ensure correct indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of tab and space characters and adjusting the logic for recognizing the start of a comment line, the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly process the prefix string without introducing incorrect comment indentation.
