### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a string until a specific column number is reached. However, there seems to be an issue when dealing with tabs and comments. The function should handle tabs and spaces correctly to maintain the correct indentation level for comments.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect handling of tab characters and spaces, which results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent. Specifically, the function fails to handle tabs and spaces properly, leading to incorrect indentation levels for comments in certain cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly interpret the tab characters and spaces while processing the prefix string. We should update how the indent levels are calculated and handled when encountering different types of characters.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line + char)
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle tabs and spaces correctly to ensure that comments are correctly indented after a dedent. It accounts for both tabs and spaces to accurately calculate the indentation level. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
