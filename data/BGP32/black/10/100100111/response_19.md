### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation in the context of a Python file. The function seems to have issues with correctly calculating the column where the comment should be placed based on the provided prefix. The main problem arises when handling tab characters in the input.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Inconsistent `current_column` calculation for different types of characters such as `' '` and `'\t'`.
2. Inability to correctly handle tab characters for calculating the indentation.
3. Incorrect logic for determining when to wait for a newline character to finish the indentation.
4. Mismatch in returning the remaining prefix value by `return res, prefix[len(res):]`.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function fails to correctly handle tab character calculations for indentation. This causes the incorrect positioning of the comment after dedents, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function does not handle tab characters properly, leading to inconsistent indentation levels.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the `current_column` calculations for tab characters to align with the actual indentation effect of tab characters.
2. Ensure correct handling of tab characters to calculate the overall indentation.
3. Review the logic for waiting for a newline character before finalizing the indentation.
4. Return the correct remaining prefix value after indentation calculations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjusting for tab's indentation width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle tab characters correctly and updating the column calculation based on the effect of tabs, the corrected function should now accurately handle the indentation scenarios, passing the provided failing test cases and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
