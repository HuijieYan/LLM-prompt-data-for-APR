### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for processing a prefix string character by character, adjusting the line and column information accordingly.
2. The function has an issue in determining the correct indentation level when encountering comments and newlines, leading to incorrect behavior after a dedent in the prefix string.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` highlights the problem with comment indentation after dedents when using tabs as indentation characters.
4. The expected input/output values provide specific scenarios where the function fails to parse the prefix string correctly.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent in a codebase that uses tabs.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of wait_for_nl flag and the logic for determining indentation levels after encountering comments and newlines in the prefix string.
- This results in the function wrongly adjusting the indentation and failing to preserve the correct formatting, especially after dedents in the input.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that comment lines are correctly indented based on the existing column value.
2. Update logic to handle tabs and spaces for indentation consistently.
3. Maintain proper tracking of indentation levels and newline characters.
4. Address the specific cases provided in the expected input/output to handle various scenarios in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_char = ''
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            if prev_char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                
        prev_char = char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic within the function to correctly handle comment lines, newline characters, and indentation levels, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
