### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on column indentation. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces during the indentation process.

### Error Locations:
1. The function does not correctly handle tabs (`\t`) when calculating column indentation.
2. The trigger for waiting for the next line (`wait_for_nl`) is based on a condition that is not appropriately set.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when tabs are used for indentation in the input text. The function fails to handle the character `\t` correctly and incorrectly calculates the column indentation, resulting in misaligned comments after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle tab characters (`\t`) when calculating column indentation.
2. Adjust the logic for waiting for the next line to ensure correct behavior when handling comments following a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting how tabs are handled in calculating indentation, the function should now correctly handle comments following a dedent when tabs are used for indentation.
