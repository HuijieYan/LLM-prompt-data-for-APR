### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to process a prefix and a column value based on the provided conditions in the code.
2. It tracks the current line, current column position, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle different characters in the prefix.
3. The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect indentation of comments after dedent with tabulated code.
4. The incorrect behavior is due to the handling of spaces and tabs in the prefix.
5. The function should correctly consume the prefix until the desired column value, maintaining proper indentation.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tabs and spaces in the prefix.
2. When encountering tabs, the `current_column` count is increased by 4, which is incorrect compared to spaces.
3. This leads to the incorrect calculation of the current indentation level.
4. As a result, the function fails to properly align comments after dedent in tabulated code.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle both spaces and tabs correctly for column position calculation.
2. Adjust the calculations for tab characters to align with the actual column behavior.
3. Ensure that the function maintains correct indentation levels for comments after dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4  # Assuming tab size is 4
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                # Unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the calculation of `current_column` based on both tabs and spaces, the corrected function should now maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent in tabulated code. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub.
