### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` which is part of the file `driver.py`. The function is meant to partially consume the input prefix string according to certain rules.
2. The function incorrectly handles the case of waiting for a new line while considering the current column position. This can lead to incorrect behavior when there are tabs or spaces.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent operation, especially in cases where tabs are used. The function fails to maintain the correct indentation for comments.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of determining when to wait for a new line and how to update the current column position.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments to how the `current_column` is updated and handling the cases when waiting for a new line, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix string and maintain the correct indentation for comments. This will address the issue reported on GitHub.
