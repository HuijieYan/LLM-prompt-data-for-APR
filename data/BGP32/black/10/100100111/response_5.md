### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation levels and comments in Python code.
2. The function has logic to track indentation based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
3. The function has an issue related to handling comments after dedent, possibly causing incorrect indentation.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks formatting correctness for code with comments at different indentation levels.
5. The expected input/output values provide insights into the function's correct behavior under various scenarios.
6. The GitHub issue highlights a specific problem related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of comments after dedent.
2. Mismatch in tracking column position during indentation changes.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to arise from the `wait_for_nl` condition not properly triggering after a dedent operation when encountering a comment. This can lead to incorrect indentation levels for comments.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the code correctly handles the condition for waiting for a new line after a dedent.
2. Verify the logic involving comments and indentations for accurate tracking.
3. Adjust the function to maintain correct indentation levels for comments after dedent operations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # ignore comments for indentation
            pass
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of comments during dedent situations, ensuring that comment indentation remains consistent.
