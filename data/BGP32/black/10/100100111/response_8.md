### 1. Analysis
The _partially_consume_prefix function is designed to consume a given prefix up to a specified column in Python source code. The function tracks the current line, column, and whether it is waiting for a newline character to decide when to stop consuming the prefix.

### 2. Potential Error Locations
The current implementation seems to have a logic flaw in handling indentation when encountering a newline character with non-zero initial column position.

### 3. Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. When the function encounters a newline character after a non-zero column, the indentation for the comment line is not being preserved, leading to incorrect formatting.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
The logic inside the buggy function needs adjustment to correctly process the input prefix to maintain consistent indentation, especially regarding tabulated comments.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Adjust indentation for tabulated comments
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)
                current_column = column
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the behavior of handling newline characters in the function, especially when dealing with tabulated content, the corrected version should address the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent as reported in the GitHub issue.
