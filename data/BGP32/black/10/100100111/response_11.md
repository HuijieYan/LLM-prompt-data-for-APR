### Analysis:
- The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix, cut it off at the specified column, and return the consumed part and the rest.
- The function has logic to handle indentation using spaces and tabs, waiting for a newline character to determine the end of the prefix up to the specified column.
- The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation and newline characters, causing the function to not correctly split the prefix based on the specified column.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of `wait_for_nl` flag.
2. Incorrect checking for `current_column` being less than the specified `column`.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case provided, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input.
- The function incorrectly identifies the end of the prefix to cut off, resulting in incorrect indentation of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag to control when to expect a newline character.
2. Verify the logic for checking if the current column exceeds the specified column to correctly determine the end of the consumed part of the prefix.
3. Adjust the logic to correctly process tabs and spaces for indentation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditional check for the column comparison and ensuring correct handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag, the corrected function should now be able to correctly split the prefix based on the specified column, resolving the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
