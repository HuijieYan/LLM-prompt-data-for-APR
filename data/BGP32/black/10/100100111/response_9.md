### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column index, storing lines based on newline characters and adjusting the current column count according to spaces and tabs.
2. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation and comments after dedenting, particularly when there are tabs involved.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function with different indentation formats and comments. It expects specific output text after formatting.
4. The current function does not handle tabulation correctly when processing comments after dedentations, as described in the GitHub issue.
5. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tabulation and tracking columns when encountering comments.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') when calculating the current column position. This incorrect calculation leads to misaligned comment indentation after dedents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the calculation of the current column position to properly account for tab characters.
2. Ensure that tab characters are recognized and processed correctly during indentation calculations.
3. Update the condition check related to comments to maintain correct indentation levels after dedenting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust the tab calculation to add 4 spaces to current column
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections to the function, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after dedentations, as reported in the GitHub issue, should be resolved.
