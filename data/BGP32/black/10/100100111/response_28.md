### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for processing a prefix string based on a given column value.
2. It tracks the current line, column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle spaces, tabs, and newlines.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent.
4. The failing test case involves checking comment indentation in the presence of tabs and spaces.
5. The code does not correctly maintain the desired comment indentation after dedents, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Identified Issues:
1. The current logic does not handle the scenario where comments need to maintain consistent indentation after dedents.
2. The condition to handle indentation correctly after dedents is missing or incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to preserve the correct indentation of comments after dedent operations. This results in incorrect formatting of comments, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the point at which the indentation is handled after dedents, especially for comments.
2. Adjust the logic to ensure that comment indentation is correctly maintained after deductions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Move the comment line to correct indentation level if needed
            if current_column < column:
                current_line = current_line.lstrip()
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to handle and maintain correct comment indentation after dedents, ensuring that the reported issue is addressed.
