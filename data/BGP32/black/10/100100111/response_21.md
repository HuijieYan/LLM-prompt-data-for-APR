### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is focused on consuming and formatting a prefix based on the given column number, indentation, and new lines.
2. The function incorrectly handles indentation levels caused by tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect output when dealing with comments.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare formatted outputs with spaces vs. tabs, showing inconsistency in comment indentation.
4. The primary bug cause is the handling of different indentation styles (tabs and spaces) within comments, leading to incorrect column counts and formatting issues.
5. To fix the bug, adjustments are needed in handling tabular indentation levels and ensuring consistent column tracking.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by mishandling tab-based indentation within comments, leading to discrepancies in column counts and formatting inconsistencies.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust how tabs are counted within comments for correct column tracking.
2. Ensure consistent handling of column counts with respect to tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust column count for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:  # Adjust handling of new lines when waiting
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())  # Adjust for tab indentation
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function, the indentations within comments will be handled consistently, resulting in comments aligning properly with the code blocks regardless of indentation styles.
