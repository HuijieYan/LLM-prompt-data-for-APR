### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is iterating over each character in the `prefix` string, building up lines based on the characters until a certain condition is met.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling indentation when encountering comments in the prefix string.

### Issue:
The function fails to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to track the column and handle the indentation correctly when encountering comments.
2. Modify the logic to handle indentation and comment alignment properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly when encountering comments, passing the failing test cases and resolving the indentation issue reported on GitHub.
