### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column index and return the consumed portion along with the remaining portion of the prefix.
2. The function keeps track of lines, current line content, current column index, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle different types of characters (space, tab, newline).
3. The bug seems to occur when handling the indentation level of comments after a dedent. The incorrect handling of comments leads to incorrect output indentation.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically targets this issue by comparing the indentation of comments after a dedent.
5. The expected input/output values provided for different scenarios should guide the correction of the bug.

### Error Location:
The bug most likely lies in the logic related to handling comments, especially when waiting for a newline character after indentation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent because it does not take the comment indentation into account when checking the column index for a newline character. This results in incorrect indentation of comments after dedent, as observed in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the function to consider the indentation level of comment lines when calculating the column index for a newline character.
2. Ensure that the function correctly maintains the relative indentation of comments after dedents to match the expected output.
3. Use the provided test cases to verify that the corrected function behaves as expected in different scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the condition `len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column` inside the newline check block, the corrected function now properly considers the expanded column index for comment lines. This correction should address the issue observed in the failing test related to comment indentation after a dedent.
