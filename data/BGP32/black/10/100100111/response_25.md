### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues with handling the indentation for comments after a dedent.
2. The function keeps track of lines, current line, current column, and a flag for detecting newline characters.
3. The bug is likely related to how the function processes indentation (tabs and spaces) and fails to preserve the correct indentation for comments.
4. The failing test cases are designed to check if comments are correctly aligned after indentation changes.
5. The GitHub issue relates to the incorrect indentation transformation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic related to processing tabs and spaces for indentation levels. When encountering tabs and spaces in the prefix, the function fails to adjust the indentation properly for comments, leading to incorrect alignment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tabs and spaces for maintaining the original indentation levels, especially for comments. Adjust the logic to ensure that comments are aligned correctly with the surrounding code after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            if not current_line.strip():
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            if not current_line.strip():
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to ensure proper handling of tabs and spaces for maintaining indentation levels, especially for comments. This version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases while addressing the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation transformations.
