### Analysis:
The `*_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation levels for comments. The function is expected to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newlines.

Here are some potential error locations within the function:
1. Misinterpreting the indentation levels for comments.
2. Incorrectly handling the newline characters.

The buggy function is causing the test `test_comment_indentation` to fail due to incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedent. It incorrectly consumes the prefix string and misinterprets the column value, resulting in incorrect comment indentation after dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of handling indentation levels for comments and correct the consumption of prefix characters based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Start a new line, reset column count
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # Character other than space or tab, wait for newline
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using the corrected function above, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the failing test `test_comment_indentation` should pass as expected.
