### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to consume a portion of the prefix string based on the given column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. The bug seems to be related to handling tab characters and maintaining the correct indentation level.

### Error Locations:
1. The calculation of `current_column` is incorrect for both spaces and tabs.
2. The logic for waiting for a new line after the indentation is not entirely correct, leading to incorrect results.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The function fails to handle tab characters properly while calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect indentation levels and misinterpretation of when to wait for a new line. As a result, the returned prefix might have incorrect indentation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the calculation of `current_column` based on the number of spaces/tabs.
2. Adjust the logic for waiting for a new line after the indentation is finished.
3. Ensure tab characters are correctly processed to maintain the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming one tab is equal to 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should process the prefix correctly, maintaining the expected indentation levels, and passing the failing test cases.
