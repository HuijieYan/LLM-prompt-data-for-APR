### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column length. However, there are issues related to the logic involving indentation handling and line splitting. The function fails to correctly handle cases where there are comments following an indentation level change (from tabs to spaces). This results in incorrect output, as indicated by the failing test case.

### Identified Errors
1. The condition check for updating the `current_column` variable is incorrect.
2. Incorrect handling of waiting for a newline character.
3. Inadequate logic to split lines and properly update the output.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function's incorrect handling of different types of indentation, leading to incorrect column tracking and line splitting. This results in incorrect output with regards to comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle different types of indentation and adjust the logic for updating the current column, waiting for newline, and splitting lines correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line = current_line.rstrip()  # Remove trailing whitespace for the correct split
            if current_line:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to properly handle different types of indentation, track the current column correctly, wait for newline characters, and split lines accurately. This should fix the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
