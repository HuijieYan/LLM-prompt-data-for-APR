### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
2. The function is supposed to consume characters from the given `prefix` string based on the `column`.
3. The bug appears to be related to incorrect handling of indentation and new lines in the input `prefix`.
4. The failing test case involves checking formatting with tabs and spaces, where the comment indentation is being incorrectly changed.
5. The code does not handle the scenario where a comment is indented more than current column but is preceded by spaces or tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the indentation level when encountering comments that should be aligned with a specific column. This leads to incorrect formatting of comments compared to the expected output, as seen in the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the indentation level for comments.
2. Ensure that the indentation is preserved for comments when the function consumes characters from the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly maintains the indentation level for comments and processes the input prefix according to the specified column. The function should now pass the failing test case and correctly handle comment indentation.
