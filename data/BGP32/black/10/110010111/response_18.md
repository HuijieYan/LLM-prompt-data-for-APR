### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is intended to consume a partial prefix up to a specified column, considering indentation characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.
- The function incorrectly handles the situation where a comment follows a dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation for the comment.
- The error message from the failing test indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual output due to this incorrect behavior.
- The expected values and types of variables in each test case are provided, highlighting the discrepancies in the function's behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when the function encounters a comment after a dedent, and it doesn't maintain the correct indentation for the comment.
- In this case, the function wrongly handles the situation when a comment should not be indented further but should maintain the previous level of indentation.
- The condition `wait_for_nl` is being set to `True` when the function should actually maintain the previous level of indentation for the comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function should maintain the previous level of indentation for the comment and not wait for a new line.
- Adjust the logic in the function to handle comments after dedent correctly and maintain consistent indentation based on the column specified.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False  # Change this to False to maintain previous indentation for comments
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the `wait_for_nl` condition appropriately, the corrected function should now maintain correct indentation, especially for comments following a dedent. This adjustment aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
