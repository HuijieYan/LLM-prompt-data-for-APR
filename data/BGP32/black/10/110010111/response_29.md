### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix while tracking the indentation level of the lines.
2. The function tracks lines, the current line being processed, the current column (indentation), and a flag `wait_for_nl` to wait for a new line.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment on a new line that should be aligned with the previous line's indentation but fails to do so.
4. The function incorrectly handles the indentation level and consumes part of the prefix incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when the function encounters a comment on a new line after dedent, it fails to maintain the correct indentation level for the comment. This causes the comment to be aligned incorrectly in some cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic of handling comments on new lines to ensure their correct alignment.
2. Modify the way the function handles indentation levels to prevent issues with comments alignment.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        lines.append(' ' * current_column + current_line.lstrip())
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        if char != '\n':
                            current_line = char
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        lines.append(' ' * current_column + current_line.lstrip())
        return ''.join(lines)
```

This corrected function updates the logic of handling comments on new lines after dedent by correctly aligning them with the previous indentation level. It also ensures that the indentation levels are processed accurately.
