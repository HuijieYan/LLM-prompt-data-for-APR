### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix of a given text while maintaining proper indentation.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the output is not as expected, resulting in an assertion error. The issue seems to be related to how comments are handled after dedentations, specifically when using tabs for indentation.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug arises from how the function handles white spaces, tabs, and new lines in the prefix text. Incorrectly handling the indentation levels after dedentations leads to errors in maintaining proper spacing for comments.

According to the failing test case and the expected variables' values, the function fails to correctly identify and process the indentation levels causing the comments to be misaligned after dedentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the column positions based on the input text indentation levels. Properly identifying whitespace, tabs, and new lines will allow the function to handle comments and maintain correct alignment after dedentations.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Change tabs to 4 spaces for consistent indentation handling
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset column count at the end of each line
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)  # Append the completed line and reset variables
                current_line = ""
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- Tabs are considered equivalent to 4 spaces for consistent handling of indentation.
- The function is modified to accurately track the column position and handle new lines to correctly maintain indentation.
- The logic for dealing with different types of whitespaces is improved to resolve the alignment issue identified in the failing test.
- The function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
