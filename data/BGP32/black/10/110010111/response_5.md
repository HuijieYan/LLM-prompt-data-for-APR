### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a given column indentation value.
2. The function fails to correctly handle indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The failing test case highlights the mismatch in the indentation of comments with and without tabs.
4. The function gets stuck in the condition `if char == '\n'` when encountering newline characters, affecting the handling of indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the scenario where comments appear after dedenting, causing the unexpected behavior in indentation. The condition `if char == '\n'` resets the column value incorrectly, leading to the observed bug.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of newline characters within the loop to ensure proper management of indentation. We should modify the condition related to newline characters to handle the scenario of comments appearing after dedenting correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]                    
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditions related to newline characters and the handling of indentation values, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle comments after dedenting. This adjustment should address the bug reported in the failing test case.
