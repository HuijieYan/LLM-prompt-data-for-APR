### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix()` is intended to handle indentation levels and consume prefix up to a certain column parameter.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix string, updating the current line, column, and other variables accordingly.
3. The bug manifests when dealing with comments (#) and incorrect indentation levels after dedent operations.
4. The failing test case reveals discrepancies in comment indentation, leading to an assertion error since the actual output differs from the expected output.
5. The issue reported on GitHub highlights specific scenarios regarding incorrect behavior related to tabulated comments after a dedent operation.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the handling of whitespace characters, particularly with tabs and spaces, impacting the identification of comment lines and proper indentation levels.
2. When encountering a comment line after dedent operations, the function fails to maintain the correct column positions, causing issues with comment indentation alignment.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Implement a proper mechanism to track indentation levels accurately, especially when handling comments after dedent transformations.
2. Ensure that whitespace characters are correctly accounted for to maintain consistent indentation alignment in the output.
3. Adjust the logic within the function to handle comments and column positioning effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char.isspace():
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '#':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line = current_line.rstrip() + '\n'
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to consider both whitespace characters and comments properly, the corrected function should now preserve the intended indentation levels, addressing the bug identified in the failing test case.
