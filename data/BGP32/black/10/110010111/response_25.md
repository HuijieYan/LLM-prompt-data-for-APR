### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a given prefix string based on the given column number.
- The function seems to have a logic error in handling the indentation and checking for newline characters.
- The failing test is related to indentation issues in comments after a dedent.
- The expected input/output values indicate how the function should behave in different scenarios.

### Error Location:
- The issue seems to be with the logic that determines whether to consume the prefix or wait for a newline.
- Incorrect calculation of the `current_column` and not handling the indentation levels properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines while consuming the prefix string.
- The incorrect logic for tracking the current column and determining when to consume the prefix causes the discrepancy in the output.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and newline characters.
- Update the logic for tracking the current column and when to consume the prefix based on the given column number.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should address the bug and pass the failing test cases. It correctly handles indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters to consume the prefix string based on the given column number.
