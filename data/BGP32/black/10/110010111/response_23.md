### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column: ` is not properly handling the indentation.
2. The use of `res = ''.join(lines)` may not be capturing the correct response.
3. Change of indentation counter `current_column` may not be accurate.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the indentation and newline characters (`\n`). The function is not correctly capturing the prefix content based on the given column. This results in a misalignment of comments after the dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the condition for correct indentation is accurately checked.
2. Adjust the code to correctly gather the expected prefix content.
3. Update the `current_column` variable accurately based on different scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                if current_column % 4 != 0:  # Adjust tab width
                    current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly capture the prefix content based on the column specified, ensuring that the comments are correctly aligned after dedenting.
