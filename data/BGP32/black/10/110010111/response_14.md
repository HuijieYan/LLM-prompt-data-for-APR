### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for correctly adjusting the indentation of comments in the input prefix text.
2. The function iterates over each character and adjusts the current line's indentation based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
3. The bug occurs when a comment is encountered after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for setting `wait_for_nl` and updating the `lines` list correctly.
5. The expected output should maintain the correct indentation of comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. When encountering a comment after dedent, ensure that the comment is aligned with the previous lines.
2. Adjust the logic for handling waits for newlines and updating indentation.
3. Update the `lines` list with the correct indentation for comments.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the bug by ensuring that comments are correctly aligned with the previous lines, especially after a dedent. It adjusts the logic for `wait_for_nl` and updating the `lines` list to handle comments effectively.
