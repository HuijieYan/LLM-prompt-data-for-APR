### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class.
2. The function is intended to partially consume the prefix string based on the provided column value.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character after consuming spaces or tabs. It fails to consider the column value when checking for the indentation level of the line.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly accounts for the column value when checking the indentation level of the line.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function failing to properly track the current column value after encountering a newline character. This leads to incorrect behavior when determining the correct indentation level of the line.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to correctly handle the column value when processing newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the column value is properly considered when handling newline characters and indentation levels.
