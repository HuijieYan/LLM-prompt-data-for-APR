### Analysis
The `partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class is responsible for processing a prefix string based on the provided column value. The function is designed to handle indentation levels and manage lines and column positions. The error message from the failing test indicates that the indentation of comments after a dedent is being incorrectly changed. This is directly related to how the function is processing the input prefix string and updating the current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl variables.

### Error Locations
1. The check for `wait_for_nl` is not resetting `current_line` after encountering a newline character.
2. The way `current_column` is calculated for spaces and tabs is not considering the actual column position.
3. The return statements based on indentation and columns may not be handling the scenarios correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the function is causing incorrect processing of the input prefix string, leading to incorrect indentation, especially for comments after dedents. The function's logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters is not capturing the precise column positions, resulting in misaligned output.

### Fix Strategy
1. Reset `current_line` after encountering a newline character when `wait_for_nl` is True.
2. Properly calculate the `current_column` based on the actual number of spaces and tabs.
3. Adjust the indent check logic to correctly manage indentation levels and handle comments after dedents.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version handles the input prefix string more accurately, properly managing the column positions and line indentation. It addresses the bug causing incorrect indentation changes for comments after dedents. This version should pass the failing test scenarios and satisfy the expected input/output values.
