### Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a portion of the given prefix string based on the given column value.
- The function processes the prefix character by character, updating the `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, and `lines` variables as needed.
- The bug seems to occur when encountering newline characters and handling indentation levels.
- The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent in code with tab indentation.
- The failing test case shows a discrepancy in comment indentation after dedenting due to the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Bug Cause
- The bug in the function arises when handling indentation levels with tabs and spaces mixed. This leads to incorrect behavior when waiting for a new line after finishing an indent.
- The function fails to maintain the correct indentation and handling of comments after dedenting, causing the failing test case due to comment misalignment.
- The issue reported on GitHub aligns with the failing test case, indicating a problem with comments during indentation changes.

### Fix Strategy
- To address this bug, the function needs to correctly handle mixed tab and space indentation.
- Ensure that comments are aligned with the correct indentation level after any dedent operation.
- Modify the logic related to handling tab and space characters to accurately track the current column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By modifying the handling of tab characters, this corrected function should correctly consume the prefix string and maintain the correct indentation levels, fixing the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values and the reported GitHub issue.
