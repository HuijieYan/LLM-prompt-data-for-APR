### Analyzing the buggy function

1. **Buggy class**: `Driver`
2. **Buggy function**: `_partially_consume_prefix`
3. **Error message**: The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatted output with a given input and raises an `AssertionError`.
4. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - **Case 1**: `prefix = '    # comment\n    '`, `column = 8`
   - **Case 2**: `prefix = ''`, `column = 4`
   - **Case 3**: `prefix = '\t# comment\n\t'`, `column = 2`
   - **Case 4**: `prefix = ''`, `column = 1`
   - **Case 5**: `prefix = '\t\t# comment\n\t'`, `column = 2`
   - **Case 6**: `prefix = '        # comment\n    '`, `column = 8`
5. **GitHub Issue**: The issue states that tabulated comments are incorrectly changed after a dedent, causing incorrect indentation.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. Incorrect handling of tabulation and indentation levels.
2. Conditional statements not properly updating the state variables.
   
### Explanation of the bug
1. The `wait_for_nl` logic is not handling tabulations and newlines in a consistent manner, resulting in incorrect indentation changes for comments after dedent.
2. The current logic doesn't properly account for tabulations and doesn't update the indentation level accordingly, leading to the assertion errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure consistent handling of tabulations and spaces during indentation calculations.
2. Update the logic within the function to accurately track the indentation level and adjust accordingly for comments.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4 # Adjusting column for tabs
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to consider both spaces and tabs for column calculation and properly handling the `wait_for_nl` condition, the corrected function should address the indentation issue and pass the failing test cases.
