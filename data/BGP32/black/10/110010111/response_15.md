### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation level of comments in the provided code snippet.
2. It seems that there is an issue with tracking the correct column position and properly aligning the comment indentation.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the comment is not aligned correctly after a dedent operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comment indentation follows the same rules as the surrounding code indentation.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem related to tabulated comments' indentation inconsistencies after dedent operations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset appropriately, leading to incorrect handling of the comment indentation.
2. In the failing case, the comment is not indented correctly after the dedent operation, leading to the assertion failure.
3. The bug causes the comment indentation to be off compared to the surrounding code.
4. The current implementation fails to address the correct behavior for aligning comments after dedent operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly reset the `wait_for_nl` flag and other relevant variables after processing each character to handle the comment indentation accurately.
2. Update the logic to properly align comments based on the surrounding code's indent level.
3. Ensure consistency in handling different types of indentation characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    if len(current_line) > 1 and current_column < column:
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version should address the issue where comments were not properly aligned after dedent operations. The function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments based on the surrounding code's indent level.
