### Fixing the bug

#### Issue:
The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset correctly while handling newline characters in the `prefix`. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent.

#### Strategy for fixing:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` after handling a newline character.
2. Fix the indentation calculation for comments after a dedent.

#### Corrected Version:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset the flag after handling newline
                wait_for_nl = False  
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent. It should pass all the test cases provided and align with the expected input/output values.
