### Analysis:
The `Driver` class contains a buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` that is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on a column value. The function processes each character in the prefix string and tracks the current line, column, and wait_for_nl boolean flag. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels and newline characters within the input prefix string. 

### Identified Bug Locations:
The main causes of the bug can be pinpointed to the inconsistent handling of indentation levels and newline characters when updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` within the loop. The incorrect update of these variables results in an incorrect output in some specific test cases where comments are not aligned properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to misbehave when encountering tabs, spaces, and newline characters within the prefix string. This misbehavior leads to improper handling of comments after dedentations, resulting in incorrect indentation levels of comments compared to the rest of the code.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels, tab characters, and newline characters when processing the prefix. Specifically, the logic for updating the current line, current column, and wait_for_nl should be aligned with the expected behavior of the function to consume the prefix up to a certain column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 7) & ~7  # Tab stops every 8 columns
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I've updated the logic for handling tab characters to properly increment the current column, aligning with the common practice of tabs advancing to the next tab stop (every 8 columns). This adjustment should ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column value without misaligned comment indentation.
