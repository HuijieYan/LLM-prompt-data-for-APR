### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a certain column width. It builds lines until a newline character is encountered, taking into account the indentation level.
2. The function fails to handle a scenario where a comment follows an indented block. It incorrectly consumes the comment line and shifts the comment's indentation.
3. The failing test case involves comparing the formatting of tab-indented code with a comment, highlighting the incorrect handling of comments after indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to handle comments following an indented block correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly handle comments following an indented block due to the `current_column` not being updated correctly after encountering a comment. This results in shifting the comment's indentation incorrectly, as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle comments following an indented block, ensuring that the comment retains its initial indentation. This involves updating the `current_column` when encountering a comment and adjusting the logic for consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle comments following an indented block correctly, ensuring that the comment retains its initial indentation.
