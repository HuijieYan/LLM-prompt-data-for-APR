### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on a specific column value.
- The function iterates over each character in the prefix, accumulates characters in `current_line`, and updates `current_column` accordingly.
- The function checks for specific characters like space, tabs, and newlines to determine the indentation level.
- If a newline is encountered, the function resets the `current_column`.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the comment indentation after dedenting.

### Error Cause:
- The buggy function fails to properly handle the indentation of comments after dedenting. This is evident from the failing test case where the comment indentation is not aligned correctly after a dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Introduce a mechanism to accurately track the comment indentation after dedenting.
- Adjust the logic to properly handle comments in the context of indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith("#"): 
                # Adjust comment indentation by aligning it with current_column
                current_line = ' ' * current_column + current_line.lstrip()
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
- Added a condition to adjust the comment indentation by aligning it with `current_column` if the line is a comment (starts with `#`) and a newline is encountered.
- This adjustment ensures that comment indentation is handled accurately in the context of the current indentation level.

By making this specific adjustment, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation of comments after dedenting, resolving the bug reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
