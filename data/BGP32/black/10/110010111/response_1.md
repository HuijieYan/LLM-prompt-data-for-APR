### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of a given string until a specific column is reached or until a new line character is encountered. 
2. The function maintains variables like `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to keep track of the consumed part of the prefix.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the new line character and waiting for a new line to start after a certain column is reached.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function fails to correctly handle cases where a comment line ends with a new line character and the next line is at the same indent level.
2. This results in a misinterpretation of the indentation level of the comment.
3. This leads to incorrect processing of the prefix, affecting the indentation of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where a new line character marks the end of a line while waiting for the next line to start.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the correct behavior when the function is waiting for a new line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to correctly handle the scenario where a new line character indicates the end of a line and the next line is at the same indentation level, ensuring that comment indentations are processed accurately.
