### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string until a specific column is reached. The bug seems to occur when handling newlines within the prefix string, leading to incorrect indentation levels for comments.

### Error location
The bug likely occurs within the condition for handling newlines (`elif char == '\n'`). This is where the issue is triggered due to incorrect resetting of `current_column`.

### Cause of the bug
- The bug causes incorrect indentation levels for comments after a dedent, especially when the comment starts immediately after a dedent.
- The function fails to update `wait_for_nl` correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering a newline character followed by a comment.
- This inconsistency in resetting `current_column` and updating `wait_for_nl` results in the misalignment of comments.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
- Properly reset `current_column` and update `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline followed by a comment.
- Ensure that comments after a dedent remain aligned correctly with the code.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                        # Handle the case where a comment follows a dedent
                        wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly handles comments after a dedent and ensures that their indentation aligns properly within the expected column range.
