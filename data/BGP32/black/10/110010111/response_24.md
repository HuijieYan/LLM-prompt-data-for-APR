### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the `prefix` string by taking into account the indentation levels of the code. It processes each character of the `prefix` string and determines when an indentation is finished based on spaces, tabs, and newlines.
   
2. The bug occurs when handling the scenario where a comment starts with spaces or tabs after the code indentation and a newline character. This breaks the expected indentation level for the comment.
   
3. The failing test case (`test_comment_indentation`) attempts to compare the actual output after consuming the prefix with the expected value. The bug is evident in the incorrect indentation of the comment line.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation of comments that follow the code indentation in the input.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the function should reset the `current_column` to correctly handle the comment indentation.
2. Update the logic to capture the correct indentation level for comments following the code.
3. Modify the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag to appropriately manage the comment's indentation.
4. Adjust the code to consume the input prefix string accurately while maintaining the correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` when encountering a newline character and adjusting the logic to handle comment indentation correctly, the corrected function should now process the input prefix string properly, aligning comments according to the expected indentation levels.
