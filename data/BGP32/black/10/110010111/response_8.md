### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to handle indentation changes for prefixes within a given column. It sets the `current_line`, updates `current_column` based on the characters in the prefix, and checks for whether to wait for a newline character.
2. The bug seems to occur when the function processes comments to maintain consistent indentation, especially after a dedent operation.
3. The bug stems from incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, leading to an inconsistency between the expected and actual output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly preserves indentation for comments by adjusting the logic that handles indentation tracking and the newline character check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent operation.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies when to wait for a newline character before adjusting the indentation.
3. Update the logic to handle comments within the specified column correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these corrections, the function should now handle comments correctly after a dedent operation, preserving the expected indentation as defined in the input.
