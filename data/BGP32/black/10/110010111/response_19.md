### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class. This function is intended to partially consume the prefix until a specific column value is reached. However, the bug causes incorrect handling of indentation for comments after dedent operations, as identified in the GitHub issue.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the incorrect handling of line breaks, whitespace characters, and indentation levels. The current implementation of the function does not correctly handle the scenario where a comment appears after dedent operations, leading to incorrect indentation levels.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the fact that when a comment appears after dedent operations in the input prefix, the function does not preserve the original indentation level for that comment. This results in a scenario where the comment is incorrectly aligned with the next line after the dedent.

The failing test case provides examples where comments after dedent operations should maintain their original indentation level, but the buggy function fails to do so.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels of comments that appear after dedent operations. This can be achieved by modifying the logic in the function to preserve the correct indentation of comments after dedent, ensuring that the output maintains the original indentation level for such comments.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedent operations, resolving the issue identified in the failing test case and GitHub issue.
