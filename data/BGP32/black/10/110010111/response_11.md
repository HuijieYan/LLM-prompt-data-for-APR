### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a certain column value. It appends characters to `current_line` and then handles the characters based on various conditions.
- The issue mentioned in the failing test is related to handling comments and their indentation after a dedent operation.
- The failing test indicates a difference in the expected and actual output for handling comments indentation.
- The function maintains `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to navigate through the prefix string.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels after newline characters and comments.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of comment indentation.
2. Logic for `wait_for_nl` after a newline character.
3. Updating `current_column` based on different characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises when the function encounters a comment line that needs to maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent operation.
- The logic within the function fails to properly adjust the comment indentation, leading to an incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that comments are processed correctly after dedent operations.
2. Adjust the logic related to handling comment indentation.
3. Update the function to correctly track the column position and indent levels after different characters in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Adjust column to correct indentation for comments
                if '#' in current_line:
                    comment_index = current_line.index('#')
                    comment_spaces = len(current_line) - comment_index
                    current_column += comment_spaces
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust column to 0 for newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the indentation issue with comments after a dedent operation and satisfy the expected input/output values.
