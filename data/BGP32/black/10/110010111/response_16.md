### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling prefix consumption for specific indentation levels in the code.
2. The bug seems to occur when a comment is encountered after a dedent.
3. The bug causes the comment's indentation to change incorrectly after a dedent. This behavior is not as expected, and the tests fail due to this incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling comments and indentation levels accurately.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic related to checking comments and handling indentation levels after a dedent.
2. Ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix while maintaining the correct indentation for comments.
3. Test the corrected function against failing test cases to ensure the bug is fixed.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # Adjust column for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle prefix consumption for indentation levels, especially when encountering comments after a dedent. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub comment and pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
