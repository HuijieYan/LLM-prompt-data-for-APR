### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume characters from the input `prefix` string until a certain column is reached. However, there are issues in the logic for handling whitespace characters, newlines, and deducing when to stop consuming characters.

#### Bugs Identified:
1. The current implementation does not handle tab characters (`\t`) correctly when calculating the column position.
2. The logic for waiting for a newline character (`\n`) is flawed, leading to incorrect consumption of characters.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test for `fs('\t# comment\n\t')`, the expected output should be: `'\t# comment\n'` because the column position is `2` and should be consumed till `#` character. However, the buggy function consumes `\t# comment\n` which doesn't align with the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correct the column calculation for whitespace characters (`' '` and `\t`).
2. Ensure the logic for waiting for a newline character is properly implemented.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = not char.isspace()
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected code includes adjustments for tab characters and fixes the logic for waiting for a newline character. It should now pass the failing test case and meet the expected input/output values.
