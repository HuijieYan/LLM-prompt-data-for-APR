The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` lies in the condition where the function checks for `current_column < column` before adding the current line to the list of lines. This results in the comment line not being included in the result string when it should be.

To fix this bug, the condition for `current_column < column` should be removed, and the line should be added to `lines` before checking if it's an empty line. This way, the comment lines will be correctly included in the result.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)                    
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)                
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should pass all the failing test cases and provide the expected output for the given inputs.
