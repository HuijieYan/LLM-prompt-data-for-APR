### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is used to consume a specific prefix within a given string until a certain column limit is reached.
2. The function tracks lines, current line content, current column number, and a flag to wait for a new line character to continue consuming.
3. The bug seems to occur when handling indentation and line breaks with comments added in between. It fails to correctly detect whether the indentation is finished or if a comment interrupts the process.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of indentation, spaces, tabs, and new line characters while considering comment characters.
5. Adjusting the logic within the function should address the issues observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    index = 0  # track the index position in the prefix string

    while index < len(prefix):
        char = prefix[index]
        current_line += char
        index += 1

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # skip empty lines
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                continue
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By iterating through the prefix string character by character and properly handling each case, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now be able to handle the indentation, comments, and line breaks accurately. This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values and should pass the failing test case provided.
