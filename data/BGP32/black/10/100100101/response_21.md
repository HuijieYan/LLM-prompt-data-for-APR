### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a prefix string up to a specified column number. However, there are issues in the logic related to handling newline characters and waiting for the next newline after reaching the specified column.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first if block after `if wait_for_nl`, the condition checks if the character is a newline, which is correct. But when handling the case where the current_line is not empty and the current_column is less than the specified column, the comparison should be against the length of `current_line` instead of `prefix[len(res)]`. This incorrect comparison leads to the function returning incorrect results.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` and checking for different characters like spaces, tabs, and newline characters is incorrect and needs revision.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition inside the first if block after `if wait_for_nl` to properly compare the length of `current_line`.
2. Update the logic for updating `current_column` correctly based on the character encountered.
3. Improve the handling of newline characters and waiting for the next newline.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and len(current_line) <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now handle the given test cases correctly and pass the failing tests.
