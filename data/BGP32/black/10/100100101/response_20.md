The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling spaces and tabs in the input prefix. The function does not correctly calculate the indentation level when encountering tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect handling of the input string.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to adjust the logic for calculating the current column based on the encountered characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines). This adjustment should ensure the correct tracking of the current column and handle the indentation levels appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming each tab equals 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now correctly handles spaces and tabs to calculate the current column level. This adjustment should ensure that the function works as expected and passes the failing test cases provided.
