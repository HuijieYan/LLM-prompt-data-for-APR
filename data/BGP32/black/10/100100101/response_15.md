### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior:

1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is checking if the current_line is not empty and the current_column is less than the desired column value. This condition causes the function to return prematurely before consuming the entire prefix string.

2. The logic for handling indentation levels with spaces and tabs is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the buggy function fails to correctly consume the prefix and stops prematurely, leading to incorrect output. The function incorrectly handles tab and space characters when calculating the `current_column` value, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle different types of indentation (spaces, tabs) and ensure that the entire prefix is consumed before returning.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
``` 

By making these corrections to handle different types of indentation characters properly and ensuring the correct consumption of the entire prefix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
