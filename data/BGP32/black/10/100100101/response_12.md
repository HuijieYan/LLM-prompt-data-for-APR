### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error causing it to not correctly handle cases where there are indentation characters before a comment in the prefix. The function relies on tracking the `current_column` to determine when to stop consuming characters from the prefix. However, the current implementation does not consider the impact of tab characters (`'\t'`) on the column count.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case where the prefix is `'\t# comment\n\t'` and the column is `2`, the function fails to properly consume the prefix. The function treats tabs as incrementing the column count by 4, leading to incorrect column tracking and premature termination of the consumption process.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function calculates the `current_column` based on the characters encountered. Specifically, we should revise the logic for tab characters to increment the column count by 1 instead of 4. This adjustment will ensure accurate tracking of the column position and correct handling of indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the tab character handling to increment the `current_column` by 1, the corrected function should now accurately consume the prefix based on the provided column position. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly handles various indentation characters while parsing the prefix.
