The buggy function (_partially_consume_prefix) has an issue with keeping track of the column position while processing the prefix string. It fails to accurately calculate the column position, leading to incorrect logic for handling newlines and spaces.

The bug occurs because the function fails to update the current column position correctly when encountering whitespace characters such as tabs and spaces, resulting in an incorrect detection of the start of a new line.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the current column position based on the character encountered, ensuring that spaces and tabs contribute accurately to the column count.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab represents 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now accurately handle indentation levels, newlines, and spacing, allowing it to consume the correct prefix based on the specified column position.
