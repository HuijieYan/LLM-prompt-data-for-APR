The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from not properly handling the newline character '\n' when calculating the current column position. The current column position should reset to 0 when encountering a newline character, but in the original function, it was not resetting. This led to incorrect calculations for the current column and ultimately incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the newline character '\n' and correctly reset the current column position to 0. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By adding the condition to set `current_column = 0` when encountering a newline character, we ensure that the current column position is correctly reset. This fix should now make the function work as expected for all test cases provided.
