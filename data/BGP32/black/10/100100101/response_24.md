The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic issue where the condition to handle indentation levels and newlines is not correctly managed. The bug causes incorrect line splitting when encountering newlines with comments.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling the indentation levels and newlines needs to be adjusted to correctly split the lines considering the column parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' or current_column >= column:
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The correction includes handling the newline characters properly by checking if the current column meets the required threshold, adding lines correctly, and resetting the necessary variables for a new line. This change ensures that the function splits the lines correctly based on the column parameter provided.

After applying this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should pass the failing test case related to comment indentation.
