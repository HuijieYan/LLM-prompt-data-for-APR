### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume characters from a prefix until a certain column is reached, similar to how indentation levels are managed in code. However, there are issues with how it handles newline characters and calculates the `current_column` value. This leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with indentation and comment lines.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the second case expects the function to consume a prefix containing only spaces and a comment, stopping at a specific column. The buggy function fails to handle this case correctly due to the incorrect calculation of the `current_column` value, leading to the behavior not meeting the expectations of the test.

### Bug Location:
The bug is primarily located in the calculation of the `current_column` value, especially when dealing with indentation spaces, tabs, and newline characters. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the `current_column` value is incremented and updated while processing characters in the prefix. Special attention should be given to correctly handling the effects of spaces, tabs, and newline characters on the column count.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` value is correctly updated based on the type of character encountered (space, tab, newline). It also adjusts the behavior for tabs to align with typical indentation rules. Now, the function should pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values for all cases.
