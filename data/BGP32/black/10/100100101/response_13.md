### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of columns and newlines within the prefix string. The function should correctly track the columns and handle new lines to return the desired prefix part.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling column increments based on different characters (' ', '\t', '\n').
2. Adjust the conditions for determining when to extract the prefix and return.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, current_line
```

By updating the conditions properly and adjusting the logic for extracting the prefix, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
