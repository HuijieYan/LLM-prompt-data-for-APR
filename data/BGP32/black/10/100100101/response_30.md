### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed part and the remaining part. The function uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the prefix string, keeping track of the current line, column, and whether it should wait for a newline character.

The bug seems to occur when checking for newlines and determining when to stop consuming characters. The expected behavior is to stop consuming characters when reaching the specified column, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column. The function should stop consuming characters and return the consumed part when the current column exceeds the specified column. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this condition, leading to incorrect output and failing assertions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly stops consuming characters and returns the consumed part once the current column exceeds the specified column. We can achieve this by reevaluating the logic for tracking the current column and correctly identifying when to stop consuming characters.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Force new line to update the column count
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected function, the loop will correctly stop consuming characters and return the consumed part once the current column exceeds the specified column. This fix should ensure that the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` will pass as expected.
