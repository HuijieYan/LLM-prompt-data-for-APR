After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems the issue lies in the condition checking where the indentation is finished and the function should wait for a new line. The bug occurs when detecting an empty line ('\n') as it resets the current column count incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the case of an empty line without affecting the column count. We can achieve this by removing the line `current_column = 0` inside the block where char == '\n'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now satisfy all expected input/output values for the failing test cases provided.
