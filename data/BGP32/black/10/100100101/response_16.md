The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number while considering indentation in the form of spaces and tabs. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation levels, which causes the function to not consume the prefix correctly in some cases.

### Analysis:
1. The function maintains a `current_column` variable to keep track of the current column's position for indentation.
2. The function uses a `wait_for_nl` flag to determine when to stop consuming the prefix based on encountering a newline character.
3. If the code encounters a space character, it increments the `current_column` by 1, and if it encounters a tab character, it increments by 4.
4. The function concatenates characters to `current_line` until it encounters a newline, which triggers different conditions based on the current state.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the code encounters a newline character (`\n`) after consuming spaces or tabs right before reaching the target column. The function incorrectly considers the indentation as finished and does not include the consumed characters in the final result, causing a mismatch in expected output values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered after consuming spaces or tabs and the current column position is less than the target column, we include the consumed characters in the final result. This involves modifying the conditions inside the loop to handle indentation correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding an additional condition inside the `elif char == '\n':` block to check if `current_column < column`, we now correctly handle cases where the newline character is encountered before reaching the target column. This correction ensures that the function properly consumes the prefix up to the desired column position. 

With this corrected version, all the expected test cases related to the buggy function should now pass successfully.
