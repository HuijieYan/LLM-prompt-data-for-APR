### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newline characters. However, there seems to be an issue with the handling of newlines and indentation levels, as indicated by the failing test related to comment indentation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) within the prefix string. It fails to correctly reset the `current_column` value and continues to accumulate characters incorrectly, leading to incorrect consumption of the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case when a newline character is encountered. We should update the `current_column` value when encountering a newline to correctly indicate the start of a new line and reset counting. Additionally, we should handle the case where the prefix ends with a newline for proper consumption.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column count for a new line
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_column += 1
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After fixing and implementing the corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
