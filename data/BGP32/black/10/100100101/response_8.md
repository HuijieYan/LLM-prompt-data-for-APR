### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume characters from a given `prefix` string until a certain column is reached. However, the implementation has a bug that prevents it from correctly handling certain cases, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character `\n`. It resets the `current_column` value to 0, which is incorrect in scenarios where the indent is not finished. This causes the function to ignore the correct indentation level and return an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling newline characters. Instead of resetting `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline, we should only do so when the indent is finished and move to the next line.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level and return the expected results for all test cases.
