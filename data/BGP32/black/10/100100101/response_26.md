### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column value.
2. The function maintains variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, and `lines` to keep track of the progress.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling newlines and indentation correctly based on the specified column value.
4. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function correctly consumes the prefix while maintaining the proper indentation for comments.

### Bug Explanation
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of newlines and indentation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering a newline, the function does not reset the `current_column` value to 0 if the line is not empty. This causes issues in maintaining the correct indentation level for the comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated when encountering newline characters. Additionally, we should handle the indentation levels properly to align with the specified column value.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline and ensuring proper indentation handling, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
