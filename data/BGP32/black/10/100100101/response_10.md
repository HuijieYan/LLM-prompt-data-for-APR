The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` lies in the calculation of the current line and column number. The function incorrectly handles the tab character ('\t') while updating the current column count. This leads to the incorrect indentation detection and affects the splitting of the prefix based on the given column.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the way the current column is updated for tab characters and ensure accurate indentation tracking.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Update the column count properly for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that tab characters are handled correctly by incrementing the current column count by 4, which aligns with the standard tab size. This adjustment allows the function to correctly identify the indentation level based on spaces and tabs, resolving the bug in the original implementation.
