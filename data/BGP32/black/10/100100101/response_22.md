The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column`. It incorrectly checks for the column condition after stripping the current line, which messes up the comparison with the provided column value.

To fix the bug, we should check the column condition before stripping the current line to ensure a correct comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Check the column condition before stripping
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
