The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect processing of indentation levels leading to incorrect output. The function fails to handle whitespaces and tabs properly, resulting in incorrect indentations.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function tracks the current column for indentation. By correctly updating the `current_column` variable based on different characters (spaces, tabs, newlines), we can ensure the function correctly identifies and consumes the prefix up to the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle different types of indentation characters correctly and provide the expected output according to the test cases provided.
