The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues handling the indentation and newline characters in the input prefix string. The `wait_for_nl` flag seems incorrectly set based on the conditions inside the function. It causes inconsistencies in tracking the current column and lines.

The correct strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function correctly tracks indentation levels, handles newline characters, and adjusts the column count accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the indentation, spaces, tabs, and newlines appropriately, leading to correct behavior in consuming the prefix string.
