### Bugs in the provided function:
1. The logic for checking and handling the indentation level is incorrect.
2. The function is not properly handling the case when the prefix ends before reaching the expected column indentation.

### Bug explanation:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the scenario where the prefix does not have enough content to reach the specified column indentation. This results in an incorrect output when the prefix ends prematurely.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of how the function handles indentation levels and ensure that it properly handles cases where the prefix ends before reaching the desired column.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if the current column is less than the desired column
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    # Check if the prefix ends before reaching the expected column
    if current_column < column:
        return ''.join(lines), prefix

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle cases where the prefix does not extend to the desired column indentation level.
