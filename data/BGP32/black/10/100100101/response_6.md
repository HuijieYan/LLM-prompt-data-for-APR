### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix based on a given column value. However, there are issues in the logic of updating the variables `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` which are causing incorrect behavior.

### Issues:
1. The `current_line` is not being reset correctly when encountering a newline character causing incorrect line consumption.
2. The `current_column` is not being updated correctly when encountering a tab character, leading to incorrect column values.
3. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being set consistently when indent is finished or when encountering specific characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for resetting `current_line` correctly when encountering a newline character.
2. Update the logic for incrementing `current_column` correctly when encountering a tab character.
3. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set appropriately when necessary to indicate the indent is finished.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections outlined above, the corrected version of the function should now correctly consume the prefix based on the given column value and pass the failing test cases.
