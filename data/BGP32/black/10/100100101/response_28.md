The buggy function is not correctly handling the case where the indentation in the prefix needs to be partially consumed before a newline character. This is causing incorrect output in some cases, as observed in the failing test.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character followed by spaces or tabs but not the column position specified. It incorrectly adds the current line to the lines list before consuming the correct amount of indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to consume the correct amount of indentation before adding the current line to the lines list. Additionally, we need to reset the current_line and current_column values after adding a line to the lines list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
