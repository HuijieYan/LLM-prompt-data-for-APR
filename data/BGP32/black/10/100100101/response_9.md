The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a bug when handling the indentation level comparison during prefix consumption, leading to incorrect behavior in processing the prefix. The bug causes the function to return incorrect values in some cases.

The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) and the indentation level is not properly reset to zero. This results in incorrect indentation comparison and creates unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` variable is correctly reset to 0.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column to 0 when encountering '\n'
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases provided.
