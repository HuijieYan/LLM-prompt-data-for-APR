The issue in the buggy function lies in the condition for checking if the column is less than the specified column value. This condition is incorrect since it should be checking if the current_column is less than the specified column, not if the current_column is equal to the specified column.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition to check if the current_column is less than the specified column value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and return the expected values for different test cases.
