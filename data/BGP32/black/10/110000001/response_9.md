## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the Driver class:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class. This function is designed to process a prefix string based on the given column value. It iterates through the characters of the prefix string and builds lines until it reaches a certain column limit.

## Identified potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The condition for checking if the character is a space `' '`, tab `'\t'`, or newline `'\n'` is used to increment the `current_column` count, but there is a logical error in how the `wait_for_nl` flag is being handled.
2. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to determine if the function should wait for a newline before capturing the current line. However, the logic that follows after encountering a newline character seems to be faulty.
3. The return logic inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block does not properly handle the case where the current line should be returned immediately without waiting for a newline.

## Explanation of the bug in the buggy function:

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag. This flag is used to wait for a newline character before capturing the current line. However, the logic inside the `if wait_for_nl:` block does not properly handle the case when a full line without a newline should be returned immediately.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where a line is complete before encountering a newline character. This can be achieved by modifying the logic inside the `for` loop to properly update the `current_line` and `current_column` variables based on the characters encountered.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for updating `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` has been adjusted to properly capture lines even if a newline character is not present. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
