## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a prefix string up to a specified column. It loops through each character of the prefix string, building up lines until a newline character is encountered and checks if the current column exceeds the specified column. If it does, the function should return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior.

## Issues:
1. The logic for handling whitespace characters and indentation is incorrect. It doesn't correctly calculate the current column based on spaces and tabs.
2. The condition for checking if the current column exceeds the specified column is incorrect.
3. The implementation of breaking lines and returning the consumed prefix is not efficient.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not accurately track the current column when counting spaces and tabs. This leads to incorrect calculations when determining whether to break the line and return the consumed prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly calculate the current column based on spaces and tabs.
2. Modify the condition for detecting when the current column exceeds the specified column.
3. Improve the logic for breaking lines and returning the consumed prefix.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:  # Checking for less than or equal to
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have fixed the calculation of the current column, adjusted the condition for checking if the current column exceeds the specified column, and improved the handling of new lines and returning the consumed prefix.
