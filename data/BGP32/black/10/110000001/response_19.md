## Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a given column number. It processes the characters in the prefix string, accumulates them in `current_line`, and checks for conditions to split the prefix based on the column number.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition to check if the current character is a newline (`char == '\n'`) is misplaced and should handle the case after checking for spaces and tabs.
2. The calculation of the `current_column` is not accurate when encountering tabs (`\t`).

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function causes an incorrect calculation of the `current_column` value, leading to an incorrect split of the prefix string. It fails to properly handle the indentation level when consuming the prefix string.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Move the newline check after processing tabs and spaces to ensure the correct handling of indentation.
2. Adjust the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tabs to increment it by 4, which is the standard tab width.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
                continue
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In this corrected version, the newline check is in the right place after handling tabs and spaces, and the `current_column` incrementation for tabs has been adjusted to 4. This ensures the correct consumption of the prefix string based on the specified column.
