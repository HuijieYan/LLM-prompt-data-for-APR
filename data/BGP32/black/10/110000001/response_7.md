### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix based on the given `column` value and return the consumed part along with the remaining part of the prefix. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line character to continue consumption.

### Bugs:
1. The condition for checking if the `current_line` is not empty and `current_column` is less than `column` is incorrect.
2. The check for a '\n' character is not handling the case where the current line is empty.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the conditions for consuming the prefix based on the specified `column`. It does not properly check for unexpected empty lines and does not handle spaces and tabs correctly in terms of column counting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition to check if the `current_column` has reached the specified `column` value.
2. Take care of unexpected empty lines while consuming the prefix.
3. Ensure accurate counting of columns for spaces and tabs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the conditions for handling line breaks, spaces, and tabs have been adjusted to correctly consume the prefix based on the specified `column` value. The function now correctly handles unexpected empty lines and calculates the column values accurately.
