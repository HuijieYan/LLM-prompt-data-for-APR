## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given `prefix` string up to a certain `column` position. It accumulates characters in `current_line` until reaching the specified column, at which point it should return the processed lines and the remaining prefix.

## Identified Issues:
1. The logic regarding `wait_for_nl` flag and handling new lines is not functioning as intended.
2. The check for `current_column < column` is incorrect and does not accurately determine when to return the result.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case where the target `column` is encountered in the middle of a line. This causes incorrect splitting of the prefix into processed lines.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Re-evaluate the conditions for tracking columns and lines.
2. Adjust the logic to properly handle the case where the target `column` is within a line.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles indentation and line continuation.
4. Refactor the logic to improve readability and robustness.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column and char != '\n':
            break
        
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

In the corrected version, the updated logic ensures that the target column is properly handled. The function accumulates characters in `current_line`, properly handles new lines, and returns the processed lines along with the remaining prefix as intended.
