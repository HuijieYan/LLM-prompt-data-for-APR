## Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be designed to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached.
2. The function uses a loop to iterate over characters in the `prefix` string and adjusts the `current_column`.
3. There are conditions in the function to handle spaces, tabs, and newlines.
4. The bug may arise from not correctly updating the `current_column` or not handling cases where the `wait_for_nl` flag is not triggered correctly.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function occurs when the `prefix` string has a newline character (`'\n'`) but the `wait_for_nl` flag is not set to `True`. This causes the `current_column` to not be reset to 0, leading to incorrect column counting and potentially returning the wrong result.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a newline character is encountered, we properly reset the `current_column` to 0 if the `wait_for_nl` condition is not met. Additionally, we should handle the case where the final line in the `prefix` string does not end with a newline to properly update the `current_line` variable.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column if not waiting for newline
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    if current_line.strip():
        lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition after encountering a newline character to reset the `current_column` to 0 if `wait_for_nl` is not set. Additionally, I added a condition after the loop ends to handle the case where the last line in `prefix` does not end with a newline character, ensuring that the final line is included in the result.
