1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
2. The potential error location in the buggy function is when it checks if `char == '\n'` to handle new lines.
3. The bug in the function occurs when it encounters an empty line, it resets the `current_column` to 0 but does not handle the case where there is valid content before the empty line to be included in the result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the case of encountering an empty line while ensuring that valid content before the empty line is still included in the result.
   
## Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added a check within the `elif char == '\n':` block to handle the case where the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column. This allows for correctly including valid content before the empty line in the result.
