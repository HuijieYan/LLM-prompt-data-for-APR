The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class seems to have an issue related to keeping track of the line and column position while processing the input `prefix`. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) without any preceding non-whitespace characters. This situation is not handled properly, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the case when a newline character is encountered without any preceding non-whitespace characters. This can be achieved by resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag and skipping the empty line. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct substring of `prefix` is returned after processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_line = ""
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we made sure to handle the unexpected empty line by resetting the necessary variables and skipping the empty line. Additionally, we properly update the `current_line` and `current_column` based on the encountered characters to maintain the correct state when processing the input prefix.
