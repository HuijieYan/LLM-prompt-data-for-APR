## Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column. It iterates over each character in the prefix and builds lines until a certain condition is met.
   
2. The potential error locations within the function are likely related to the conditions and logic for handling newline characters, spaces, and tabs.
   
3. The bug in the function occurs when it encounters a newline character and proceeds to clear the current_line, resetting the current_column to 0. This might cause the function to miss updating the lines list correctly.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when encountering a newline character, the current_line is correctly appended to the lines list before resetting the variables for the next line.
   
5. Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # append current_line even if it's empty
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

In this corrected version, when encountering a newline character, the `current_line` is immediately appended to the `lines` list before being cleared and reset, ensuring that the lines are properly updated throughout the function.
