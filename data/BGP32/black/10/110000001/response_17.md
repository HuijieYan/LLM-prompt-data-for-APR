## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit.
- It iterates through each character in the prefix string, keeping track of the current line, column, and identifying when to stop based on certain conditions.

## Issue:
- The bug in this function is within the conditional check for `wait_for_nl` and the handling of lines when reaching a newline character.
- The logic for appending the current line to `lines` is incorrect, causing the function to return unexpected results.

## Bug fix strategy:
- Adjust the logic for updating lines and current line within the function to correctly handle newline characters and track progress.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the incorrect logic concerning the handling of newlines and appending lines to the `lines` list.
