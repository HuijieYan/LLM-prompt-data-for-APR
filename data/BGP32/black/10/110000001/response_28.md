1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column. It iterates through the characters in the prefix string and constructs lines based on the column position. However, the logic inside the function is causing it to fail in some cases.

2. Potential Error Location:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
- Incorrect handling of current_line and lines creation.
- Incorrect condition for checking if a newline character is encountered.
- Incorrect calculation of column positions.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect logic for handling newlines and column positions. The function fails to correctly track the current column position and construct lines based on the specified column.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the column position, separates lines based on the given column, and properly handles newline characters. Additionally, the function needs to handle cases where the column position is not met within a line.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle the case where the column is not met within a line
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if the column position is not met within a line and return the appropriate result. This adjustment ensures that the function handles cases where the column is not satisfied within a line and continues processing the prefix string correctly.
