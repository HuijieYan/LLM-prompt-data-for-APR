## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit. It processes each character in the prefix string, maintaining the current line being built, the current column position, and a flag to wait for a new line before proceeding. However, there are several potential error locations within the function:
1. When checking for a newline character (`\n`) to indicate the end of a line, the logic seems to be incorrect.
2. The condition for appending the current line to the list of lines should be re-evaluated.
3. Handling of characters other than space, tab, and newline might not be appropriately serving the intended purpose.


## Bug explanation:
The bug in this function occurs when encountering a newline character (`\n`) while waiting for the end of the current line. The function incorrectly appends the current line (including the newline character) to the list of lines in this case, without considering the column limit. This leads to incorrect output and partially processed prefix strings.


## Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the case where a newline character is found when waiting for the end of the current line. The logic for appending the current line to the list of lines should also be updated to ensure it respects the column limit. Additionally, the handling of characters other than space, tab, and newline should be reviewed to ensure correct processing.


## Corrected version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line  # Include the current line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version:
- I have modified the condition after encountering a newline character to append the current line to the list only if it satisfies the column limit condition.
- Added the current line when returning the result to include the partially processed line.
- Adjusted the processing of newline characters to handle unexpected empty lines correctly.

These changes aim to address the identified bug and ensure the function operates as intended.
