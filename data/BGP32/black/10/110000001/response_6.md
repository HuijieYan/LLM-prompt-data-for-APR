## Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column value. It reads characters from the prefix string until the column value is reached, taking into account different types of characters like spaces, tabs, and new lines.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` seems incorrect as it does not handle the case where `current_column` is equal to `column`.
2. The logic for handling different types of characters (spaces, tabs, new lines) may not work correctly.
3. The logic for building `lines` and handling `wait_for_nl` may not be properly synchronized.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of the condition `current_column < column`. The current implementation may skip characters when the `column` is equal to `current_column`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the condition `current_column < column` to handle the case where `current_column` is equal to `column`.
2. Ensure that the logic for handling different types of characters (spaces, tabs, new lines) is correctly implemented.
3. Make sure that the synchronization between building `lines` and handling `wait_for_nl` is correct.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Adjusted condition
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
