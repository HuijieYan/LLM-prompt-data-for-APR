Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a given text up to a specified column number.
- The function tracks the current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.
- The bug seems to be related to handling newline characters (`\n`) and checking the column numbers.

Error Location:
- The bug seems to be in the condition where `char == '\n'`.

Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`), it resets `current_column` to 0 regardless of the current column number. This can lead to incorrect tracking of consumed columns.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, we only reset `current_column` if the line is not empty. This will prevent incorrectly resetting the column count.

Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
