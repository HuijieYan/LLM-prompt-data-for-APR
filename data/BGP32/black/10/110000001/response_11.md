## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column, splitting it into lines while considering spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The function iterates through the characters of the prefix string and performs the necessary operations.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in this function is in the condition that checks if the current character is a newline (`char == '\n'`). If the character is a newline, it should reset the `current_column` to 0. However, this is not correctly handled in the code, resulting in incorrect column counting and line splitting.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `current_column` is not properly reset to 0 when encountering a newline character. This leads to incorrect column counts and affects the line splitting logic. 

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered. This will ensure accurate column tracking and proper line splitting.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset column count when encountering newline
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                lines.append(current_line)
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I added the resetting of `current_column` and the addition of `current_line` to `lines` when encountering a newline character. This fixes the bug by ensuring proper column tracking and accurate line splitting based on the given column.
