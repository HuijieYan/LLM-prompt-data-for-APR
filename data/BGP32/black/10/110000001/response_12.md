### Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a specific column value.
- The function tracks the current line, column, and waiting for a newline character to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

### Identified Errors:
1. In the `if wait_for_nl:` block, the condition for resetting the `current_column` is incorrect. It should be `current_column = 1` instead of `current_column = 0`.
2. The return statement within the `if char == '\n':` block is missing the logic to handle prefixes that do not meet the column condition.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by not properly handling cases where the prefix does not meet the specified column condition. This can lead to incorrect consumption of the prefix and missing characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the condition to reset `current_column` to `current_column = 1` when encountering a newline character.
2. Update the return statement within the newline block to handle cases where the prefix does not meet the column condition.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 1
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 1
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the `current_column = 0` line to `current_column = 1` in the newline block.
2. Added an `else` block to handle cases where the prefix does not meet the column condition within the newline block.
