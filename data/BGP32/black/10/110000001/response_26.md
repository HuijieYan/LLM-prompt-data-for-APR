## Issues with the buggy function:
1. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix based on a given column limit, but it has several logical errors.
2. The handling of new lines and whitespace characters is causing the function to not work as intended.
3. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being properly reset after encountering a new line character.
4. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is not correctly implemented.


## Suggestions for fixing the bug:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a new line character.
2. Adjust the condition for checking the current column to ensure it is less than the specified column before consuming the prefix.
3. Handle the cases of newline, space, and tab characters more effectively to accurately track the column count.
4. Simplify the logic to consume the prefix based on the given column limit.


## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly consume the prefix based on the given column limit and handle newline, space, and tab characters as intended.
