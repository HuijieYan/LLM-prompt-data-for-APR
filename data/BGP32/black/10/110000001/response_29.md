### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix based on a given column number. It processes each character in the prefix while keeping track of the current line, column, and whether it needs to wait for a new line ("\n").

### Identified Errors:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is checking if the current line has content and if the current column is less than the specified column. However, it should be checking if the current column is equal to or greater than the specified column.
2. The `return res, prefix[len(res):]` statement is returning the result based on `len(res)`, but it should return based on `len(res) + len(current_line)`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is caused by incorrect logic when checking the current column against the specified column and also when calculating the remaining prefix to be processed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for checking the current column against the specified column and correct the calculation of the remaining prefix to be processed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res) + len(current_line):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the condition `current_column >= column` has been updated, and the calculation of the remaining prefix has been adjusted to include the length of `current_line`. This should resolve the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
