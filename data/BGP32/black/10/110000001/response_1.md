## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class. This function is designed to partially consume the input `prefix` string up to a certain `column` limit, based on indentation rules.

## Identified Errors:
1. The `lines` list is not being fully utilized. It should be used to store complete lines, not just part of them.
2. The condition for checking if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified `column` is incorrect, leading to the function returning prematurely.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function prematurely returns the consumed lines without completing the entire process of consuming lines up to the specified column.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes lines up to the specified column limit before returning the result.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        lines.append(current_line)
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we have made adjustments to ensure that the function correctly consumes lines up to the specified column limit and handles line endings appropriately. Now, the function should work as intended without premature returns.
