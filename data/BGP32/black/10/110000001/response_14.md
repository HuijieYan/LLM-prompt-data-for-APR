1. Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class aims to process a given `prefix` string based on certain rules related to newline, whitespace characters, and column position. The function iterates over the characters in the `prefix` string and tries to split it into lines based on specific criteria.

2. Potential error locations:
- The logic for handling whitespace characters may not be correctly updating the `current_column`.
- There could be an issue with appending the `current_line` to `lines` in the correct order and resetting variables.
- The condition for returning the result seems to be based on `current_column`, which may not be accurately tracked.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function may be caused by the incorrect handling of whitespace characters and newline characters, leading to incorrect line splitting and column tracking. This can result in an incorrect output when extracting the processed prefix.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we should review and adjust the logic related to handling whitespace characters, updating `current_column` correctly, appending lines in the right order, and determining the condition for returning the processed prefix.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, I have made adjustments to how the `current_column` is updated, the logic for appending lines to the `lines` list, and the condition for handling newline characters. This should address the issues identified and improve the functionality of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
