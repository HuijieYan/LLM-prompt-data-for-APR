## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix until a specific column position is reached. It seems like the function is intended to split the prefix text into two parts - one that is up to the specified column and the rest.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` might not be functioning as expected.
2. The logic for updating `current_column` when encountering whitespace characters like space (' ') and tabs ('\t') may not be accurate.
3. The handling of newlines ('\n') seems to be causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character ('\n') within the prefix and fails to split the prefix correctly. This results in the function returning an incorrect result.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix until the specified column position and splits it accurately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling newlines and updating the current column position has been adjusted to ensure the correct splitting of the prefix based on the specified column.
