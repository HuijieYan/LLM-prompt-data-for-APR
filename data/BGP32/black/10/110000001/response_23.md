The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is designed to consume a given prefix string up to a specified column number, separating the consumed part from the remaining part. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that may cause incorrect behavior:

1. The logic related to `current_column` and waiting for a new line (`\n`) might not be functioning as intended.
2. The conditions for checking whitespace characters (`' '` and `\t`) and new line characters (`\n`) could lead to incorrect calculations of the column position.
3. There is an issue where the function does not handle the case where the prefix does not contain any newline character after reaching the specified column.

To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, a more straightforward approach for tracking the current column position, identifying the end of the consumed part, and properly handling edge cases where the prefix does not contain a newline character is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4 if char == '\t' else 0

        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                # Include the current line in the consumed part
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                break

    consumed_part = ''.join(lines)
    remaining_part = prefix[len(consumed_part):]

    return consumed_part, remaining_part
```

In this corrected version:
- The column count is updated correctly based on the encountered characters.
- The new line condition is adjusted to correctly handle the end of the consumed part.
- The remaining part is extracted properly even if no newline character is found after reaching the specified column.

By implementing these changes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now consume the prefix string up to the specified column correctly and return the consumed part along with the remaining part.
