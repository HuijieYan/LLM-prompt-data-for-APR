The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is intended to partially consume a prefix string up to a given column number. However, it currently has a bug where it does not properly handle the case when the `wait_for_nl` condition is True and encounters a character that is not '\n' or whitespace. This leads to missing some characters from the prefix string.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `wait_for_nl` is True and a non-whitespace character is encountered, the characters are properly appended to the `current_line` without skipping any.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    # Append characters to current_line when not newline
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that when `wait_for_nl` is True and a non-whitespace character is encountered, it properly appends the characters to the `current_line` without skipping them.
