## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to partially consume a prefix string up to a certain column number.
- The function uses the `prefix` string to identify lines based on spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles calculating the current column number and waiting for a new line.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function incorrectly tracks the `current_column` value while parsing the prefix string.
- The condition to check if `current_column < column` is not properly handled, leading to incorrect processing of the prefix.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to ensure that the `current_column` value is correctly updated and compared with the specified `column` value.
- Rework the logic to accurately handle spaces, tabs, and newline characters while tracking the current column position.
- Make sure to properly update the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables within the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset current column for a new line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column += 1  # Increase column for non-space/tab characters
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly for each character encountered. We also reset the `current_column` when encountering a newline character to start counting from zero for a new line. Additionally, we correctly increment the `current_column` for non-space/tab characters to maintain the accurate position.
