## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column number. It processes each character in the prefix string while keeping track of the current line, current column, and whether it should wait for a new line. The function is expected to return the consumed lines up to the specified column number along with the remaining part of the prefix string that was not consumed.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling the end of an indent and waiting for a new line may not be working correctly.
2. The condition to check if the current character is a space or tab may need to be adjusted.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug may occur when the function encounters unexpected cases where an indent is finished or a new line is detected, leading to incorrect handling of the consumed lines and the remaining prefix string.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Revise the logic for handling indents and new lines to ensure correct consumption of lines up to the specified column number.
2. Adjust the conditions for checking spaces and tabs to accurately track the current column number.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling the end of an indent and waiting for a new line has been revised to ensure correct consumption of lines up to the specified column number. Additionally, the conditions for checking spaces and tabs have been adjusted to accurately update the current column number.
