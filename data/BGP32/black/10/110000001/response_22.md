## Analysis:
The provided buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class. This function is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. However, there are several potential error locations within the function that could lead to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` is used to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column value. However, the comparison is not accurate because `current_column` is incremented by different amounts based on the character (space, tab, newline) encountered. This could lead to incorrect comparison results.

2. The handling of newline characters (`\n`) is inconsistent and could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The logic for handling indentation is based on `wait_for_nl` flag which might not correctly track the state of whether to wait for a newline character.

## Bug Cause:
The primary cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of character increments for the `current_column` and the inconsistent logic related to consuming newline characters.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure accurate tracking of column value by consistently incrementing it based on the character type encountered.
2. Properly handle newline characters to avoid unexpected behavior.
3. Simplify the logic for handling indentation to ensure correctness.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, I have adjusted the character increment logic, fixed the handling of newline characters, and improved the indentation handling to ensure correct behavior of the function.
