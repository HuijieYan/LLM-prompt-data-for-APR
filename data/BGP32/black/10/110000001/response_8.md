## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class.
- The function is intended to parse a given prefix string based on specific rules related to indentation and newlines.

## Errors:
1. The logic for handling the newline character (`\n`) seems incorrect.
2. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the target column is flawed.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) in the input `prefix`. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the newline character is not expected based on the indentation level. This leads to unexpected behavior and may result in incorrect parsing of the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly handle the newline character and reset the current column based on the indentation level.
2. Ensure that the function correctly determines when to wait for a newline based on the indentation rules.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the newline character is handled correctly based on the indentation rules and the target column. It fixes the bug by properly resetting the current line and column when encountering a newline character.
