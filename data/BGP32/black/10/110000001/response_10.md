### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is within the `Driver` class. It is designed to partially consume the prefix based on a given column number. The function iterates through the characters in the prefix and constructs lines based on space, tab, and newline characters. The issue seems to be related to handling newline characters and tracking the current column number correctly.

### Identifying Potential Errors: 
1. The handling of newline characters may not be updating the current column number correctly.
2. The logic for determining when to add lines and reset the current line might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character and doesn't effectively reset the current column number to 0, causing the subsequent lines to be constructed incorrectly. This leads to incorrect output when partial consumption based on the column number is needed.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current column number is correctly updated when encountering newline characters. Additionally, the logic for adding lines and resetting the current line needs to be revised for accurate partial consumption.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # Resetting current_column when encountering a newline character
            current_line = ""  # Clearing current_line
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, the current_column is correctly reset to 0 when encountering a newline character, ensuring that subsequent lines are constructed correctly for partial consumption based on the specified column number.
