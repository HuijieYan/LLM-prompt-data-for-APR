### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix until a certain column limit is reached. The function appears to have an issue in accurately handling newline characters and resetting the line and column values. This inconsistency causes the function to return incorrect results, leading to test failures.

### Bug Cause:
The main issue seems to be with how the function handles newline characters. When encountering a newline character, the function should reset the `current_column` to 0 and handle the next character according to the indentation rules. However, in the current implementation, this resetting process is not correctly handled, leading to incorrect tracking of the current position.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly resets the line and column values when encountering newline characters. Specifically, after reaching a newline character, `current_column` should be set to 0, and the function should decide how to proceed with the next character based on the indentation rules.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of newline characters and ensuring proper resetting of `current_column` and updating of `wait_for_nl`, the function should now be able to correctly handle the provided test cases and pass them.
