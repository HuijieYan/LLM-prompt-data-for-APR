Based on the runtime values and types provided, it seems the issue lies in how the function handles the indentation level when encountering spaces or tabs in the prefix string. The function does not correctly update the `current_column` value when encountering spaces or tabs, leading to incorrect indentation calculations. As a result, the function fails to properly consume the prefix string based on the specified column value.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value is updated correctly whenever a space or tab character is encountered. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic for handling tabs to increment the column correctly by 4 spaces. Finally, we need to properly handle the case when encountering a newline character to reset the `current_column` value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation level within the prefix string and properly consume the prefix based on the specified column value, passing the failing test cases.
