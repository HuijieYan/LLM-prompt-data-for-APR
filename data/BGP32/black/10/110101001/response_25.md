### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix up to a certain column value. The issue lies in how it handles the indentation levels within the prefix. Specifically, when encountering spaces or tabs, it incorrectly calculates the column position. This leads to incorrect division of the prefix into consumed and remaining parts.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the column calculation for spaces and tabs to ensure it aligns correctly according to Python indentation rules.
2. Refine the logic for handling different characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to properly consume the prefix up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function adjusts the column calculation for spaces and tabs and refines the logic for handling characters and newline boundaries, ensuring correct consumption of the prefix up to the specified column.
