### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes an issue when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` but the character being processed is not a newline character. This results in incorrectly splitting the lines and not considering the indentation level properly, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the `wait_for_nl` flag is set, the function correctly checks the indentation level by comparing the current column with the provided `column` parameter. Additionally, we need to handle the cases where a newline character is missing, which should not reset the `current_column` counter.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1  # Update the column count even if not a newline
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to correctly handle the indentation levels, even when the newline character is not encountered, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
