### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column position, considering indentation factors like spaces and tabs. The function should split the consumed part and the remaining part for further processing. However, the function has a bug where it fails to correctly handle the case when the comment in the prefix string does not start at the expected column position. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to split the consumed and remaining parts.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the comment in the prefix string does not start at the expected column position. Specifically, when encountering a newline character before reaching the expected column position, the function incorrectly considers the line as empty and does not proceed to split the consumed part and the remaining part accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where the comment does not start at the expected column position. We should ensure that the function properly identifies and splits the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix string based on the column position.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will appropriately split the prefix string based on the column position, ensuring that comments are handled correctly regardless of their position in the input.
