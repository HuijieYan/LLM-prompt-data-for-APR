### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles newline characters ('\n') while parsing the prefix string. The function incorrectly processes the newline characters when detecting the end of indentation, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the provided test case, the function is expected to consume the prefix string until a specific column number is reached.
2. The function fails to correctly handle the newline character ('\n') in the prefix string when determining the end of the indentation. This results in incorrect splitting of the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the newline characters and correctly determine when to split the prefix string based on the specified column number.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_line and current_column for a new line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished, wait for new line
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character and addressing the logic to correctly handle newline characters within the prefix string, this corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
