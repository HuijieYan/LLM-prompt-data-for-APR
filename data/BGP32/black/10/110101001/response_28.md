### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the condition of checking `current_column < column` inside the `if char == '\n':` block. This condition is incorrect because it compares `current_column` (the column at the end of the current line) with `column` (the target column) within a newline character block. This comparison should happen after consuming all characters until a newline character, not just within the newline block.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to move the condition `current_column < column` outside the `if char == '\n':` block, as we need to check if the target column is reached after consuming the complete line. This adjustment will ensure accurate tracking of the column position.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By applying the fix mentioned above, the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the column position tracking accurately based on the target column value.
