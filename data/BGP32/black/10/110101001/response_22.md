### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached, considering newline characters and indentation. The issue lies in the logic related to handling indentation and newline characters. The function fails to correctly track the current column position and the lines generated based on the input prefix.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character within the prefix string. It fails to reset the `current_line` and `current_column` variables appropriately, leading to incorrect line generation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to newline character handling. Specifically, when encountering a newline character, we should reset `current_line` and `current_column` accordingly before proceeding to the next character in the prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            # newline handling
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_column` and `current_line` appropriately when encountering newline characters, the corrected function should now be able to handle indentation and newline characters correctly, passing the failing test cases provided.
