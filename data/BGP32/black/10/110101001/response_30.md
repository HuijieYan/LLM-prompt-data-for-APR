### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the logic to consume the prefix string based on indentation levels. The issue arises when encountering a newline character (`\n`) without sufficient indentation for the next line. This causes the function to miss part of the prefix that should be consumed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly consumes the prefix based on indentation levels and line breaks. We should adjust the logic around handling newline characters and tracking the current column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Check if the current line exceeds the desired column
                if len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset the current column after a newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indentation is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

By correcting the logic within the function to handle indentation levels and line breaks properly, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
