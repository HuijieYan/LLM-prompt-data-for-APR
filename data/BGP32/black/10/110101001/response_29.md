### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the handling of indentation. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the function resets the `current_column` to 0 regardless of the indentation level. This behavior is incorrect because it should only reset the `current_column` to 0 if there is no pending indentation on the current line.

In Case 1, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character, even though there is pending indentation on the current line which causes the function to not consume the entire prefix correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the `current_column` is updated when encountering a newline character. The `current_column` should only be reset to 0 if there is no pending indentation on the current line.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column > 0:  # check if there is pending indentation
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version of the function includes the check to only reset `current_column` to 0 when there is no pending indentation on the current line. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on the specified column.
