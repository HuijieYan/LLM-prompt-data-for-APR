### Bug Explanation
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the input `prefix`, especially when encountering newline characters. This results in incorrect splitting of lines and incorrect calculation of the prefix to be consumed.
- The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset after encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect behavior when processing subsequent characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset when encountering newline characters to correctly identify the end of a line.
- Update the logic to correctly handle the indentation of comments and identify when to split lines based on the given `column` value.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue
        
        if char in [' ', '\t']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            
        current_line += char
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `wait_for_nl` flag correctly and adjusting the logic for handling newline characters and comment lines, the corrected function should now be able to accurately split lines in the input `prefix` based on the provided `column` value.
