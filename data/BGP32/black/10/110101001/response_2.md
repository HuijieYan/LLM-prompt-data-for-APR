### Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from not handling the case where there is no newline character after the prefix. This results in the current line being incomplete and not added to the `lines` list, ultimately leading to an incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `wait_for_nl` is True after the loop to handle the case where the current line has not been added to `lines`.
2. Update the condition for checking if `current_line` is not empty inside the loop to ensure that lines with only spaces or tabs are ignored.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        if wait_for_nl and current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By incorporating the mentioned strategy and making necessary adjustments to the conditions, the corrected version of the function should now handle the cases provided in the failing tests.
