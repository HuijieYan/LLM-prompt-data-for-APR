### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the condition to update `current_column` when encountering a newline character is missing. This causes incorrect handling of the indentation level and leads to unexpected results in some test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly updated when encountering a newline character to properly track the current indentation level. This involves resetting `current_column` to 0 when a newline character is found.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column on encountering newline
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition `current_column = 0` when `char == '\n'`, we ensure that the `current_column` is correctly reset, fixing the bug and ensuring correct handling of indentation levels.
