### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises when handling a line break (`'\n'`) in the `prefix` string. The current logic fails to correctly account for cases where there is only a line break without any preceding characters, leading to incorrect behavior in determining indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to properly handle scenarios where there are empty lines or lines with only whitespace characters. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes and consumes the line breaks and adjusts the indentation level accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle line breaks and indentation levels, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
