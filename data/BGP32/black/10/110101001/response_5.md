### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of newlines when determining the correct indentation level. The function fails to properly consider the indentation level of comments in certain cases, resulting in incorrect parsing of the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to tracking the current column and correctly handling the indentation. We should also ensure that comments are correctly accounted for when determining the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Rationale
In the corrected version, we included an additional handling logic for the newline character, where we directly add the current line to the lines list and reset the current line and column if a newline is encountered. This change ensures that comments with different levels of indentation are properly processed, addressing the bug identified in the failing tests for the function.
