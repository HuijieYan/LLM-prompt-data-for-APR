### Error:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling cases where there is a comment at the end of a line with leading whitespace.

### Cause of the bug:
The `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset when encountering a newline character after reading a comment, causing the function to treat subsequent lines as part of the comment rather than processing them correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag to `False` after encountering a newline character in the case where we are waiting for a newline to end the indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After applying these changes, the function should handle cases with comments at the end of lines properly, passing the failing test.
