### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, in some cases, the logic to handle indentation and new lines is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels and new lines.
2. Inconsistent updating of `current_line` and `current_column`.
3. Mismanagement of the `wait_for_nl` flag.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line that does not exceed the specified column limit. In such cases, the function incorrectly appends the comment line to the `lines` list and resets `current_line`, causing the comment line to be duplicated in the final result.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise how the function handles lines that do not exceed the column limit. The function should append lines to `lines` only if the current line is non-empty and within the specified column limit.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the mentioned changes, the function should now correctly handle lines within the specified column limit, resolving the duplication issue with comment lines in the output.
