### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the case where there is an indent followed by a comment in the prefix string. The function incorrectly waits for a newline character to handle the comment but does not skip the spaces or tabs before the comment itself. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation level, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to properly handle the indentation level when encountering a comment in the prefix string. We need to skip any leading spaces or tabs before the comment while updating the column count accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line on encountering a newline
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                break  # Break when indent is finished before the column
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and comment scenarios in the prefix string and pass the failing test cases.
