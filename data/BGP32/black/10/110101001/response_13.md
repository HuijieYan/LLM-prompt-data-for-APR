### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to correctly handle indentations and comment lines. In cases where the comment starts at the same column or a column after the specified `column`, the function is not correctly identifying and processing the comment lines.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the condition where the function checks if the indentation is finished (`wait_for_nl = True`). When a space or tab character is encountered after the comment line, the function mistakenly treats it as the end of the comment and resets the `current_line` without considering the indentation level.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition when checking for the end of the comment line to ensure that it properly handles cases where the comment is at the same or a greater column than the specified `column`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char in ['\t', ' ']:
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = current_column >= column

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

After applying the corrections in the code above, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and comment lines, passing the failing test.
