### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume characters from a prefix until a certain column limit is reached. However, there are issues in the logic of handling characters, especially when encountering new lines or white spaces, causing incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the cases when encountering new lines or white spaces. Specifically:
- When encountering a new line character, the current column should be reset to 0, but the code does not handle empty lines correctly.
- The current logic for incrementing `current_column` for spaces and tabs is incorrect.
- When encountering white spaces or tabs, the function should wait for a new line to start a new line of code, but the logic for this is flawed.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
- Reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line character.
- Adjust how `current_column` is incremented for tabs and spaces.
- Update the logic for when to wait for a new line based on the indent level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_column >= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False

            current_line += char
            if char not in [' ', '\t']:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing tests.
