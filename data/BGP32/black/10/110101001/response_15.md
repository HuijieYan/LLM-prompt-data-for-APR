### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle an indentation scenario where a line starts with a comment. It reads each character of the prefix string, builds lines based on indentation level, and waits for a new line to start. However, the function fails to properly handle cases where the comment is the first part of the line followed by spaces or tabs.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because when a line starts with a comment followed by spaces or tabs, the function incorrectly waits for a newline character to split the lines. This behavior causes incorrect handling of the indentation level, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of how the function handles lines starting with comments followed by spaces or tabs. We should correctly update the indentation level and handle the splitting of lines without waiting for a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the changes above, the function now correctly handles cases where a line starts with a comment followed by spaces or tabs, ensuring the correct splitting of lines based on the given column value. This should address the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
