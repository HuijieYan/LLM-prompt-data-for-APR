### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column position. However, based on the failing tests and the provided runtime values, the function has issues handling newline characters and correctly calculating the column position.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from how it handles newline characters. When encountering a newline character `'\n'`, the function fails to correctly update the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect column calculations. This issue causes the function to return incorrect results, failing the tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is updated appropriately when encountering newline characters. Additionally, the function should consider cases where the prefix string is empty. By properly handling these scenarios, we can correct the function's behavior and ensure it passes the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        if not prefix:
            return '', ''
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column for new line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, we address the issues related to newline characters and correctly handle edge cases where the prefix is empty. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior.
