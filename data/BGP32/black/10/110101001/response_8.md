### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because it does not handle the case when the last line does not end with a newline character. This causes the function to miss adding the last line to the `lines` list, resulting in an incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the last line is properly added to the `lines` list even if it doesn't end with a newline character. We can modify the logic to handle this scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    # Include the last line even if it doesn't end with a newline character
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including the last line in the `lines` list even if it doesn't end with a newline character, the corrected function should now handle all cases properly and pass the failing test.
