The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles the indentation levels and new lines in the input prefix. The function is not correctly reconstructing the lines based on the provided column as it fails to properly track and update the `current_column` value.

The current logic seems to be incorrect in handling the column when encountering newlines and tabs. Additionally, setting `wait_for_nl` to `True` should only happen when encountering a tab or space, not any other character.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the indentation changes and track the current column position. Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ''
```

This corrected version should address the issues with tracking the indentation levels and handling different types of characters in the prefix. It considers tabs and spaces for column calculations and correctly reconstructs the lines based on the provided column. This should make the function work correctly with the failing tests provided.
