### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle indentation within a given prefix string. The function maintains `current_line` to track the current line being built, `lines` to store completed lines, `current_column` to track the current column position, and `wait_for_nl` to indicate if it is waiting for a newline character.

The bug arises when the function encounters a newline character `'\n'` within the prefix. In some cases, it fails to correctly handle the newline character's impact on the indentation level, resulting in incorrect splitting of lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character `'\n'`. If the function is in a waiting state (`wait_for_nl = True`) due to encountering non-space/tab characters earlier, it incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 without considering the current indentation level. This leads to incorrect line splitting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character `'\n'`, the function correctly resets the `current_column` based on the indentation level of the current line. Additionally, the function should handle cases where the prefix ends with a partial line that needs to be included.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self,prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current_column based on last non-space/tab character
                current_column = 0
                for last_char in reversed(current_line.strip()):
                    if last_char not in [' ', '\t']:
                        break
                    if last_char == ' ':
                        current_column += 1
                    else:
                        current_column += 4
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a loop to calculate `current_column` correctly based on the indentation level of the current line when encountering a newline character, the corrected function ensures proper handling of indentation and line splitting.
