### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume characters from the `prefix` string until a certain `column` position is reached. The function is intended to handle tab characters and count them as 4 characters for indentation purposes.

The identified potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for handling tab characters (`\t`) might not correctly count them as 4 characters for the `current_column`.
2. The condition for checking if `current_column` is less than `column` might not be accurate.
3. The logic for updating the `lines` list and `current_line` might not correctly reset when a new line is encountered.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect counting and handling of tab characters in the `prefix` string. This leads to incorrect indentation calculations and splitting of the lines, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle tab characters as equivalent to 4 spaces, adjust the condition for checking the column position, and ensure proper handling of line splits when encountering new lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_column += 1
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                continue
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the handling of tab characters, updates the condition for checking the column position, and ensures proper handling of line splitting. It now correctly counts tabs as 4 characters and checks if the column is less than or equal to the specified column.
