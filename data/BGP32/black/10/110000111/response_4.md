The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is occurring due to incorrect handling of indentation for spaces and tabs. The function is expected to consume characters in the prefix until a specific column number is reached, preserving the indentation of lines with comments. 

The cause of the bug is that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set incorrectly, not accounting for cases where a tab character is encountered immediately after a non-empty line. This leads to incorrect indentation handling when encountering tab characters in the prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for setting the `wait_for_nl` flag and handling tab characters. We should also ensure that the function correctly handles tab characters and updates the `current_column` value accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = current_column + (4 - current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version accounts for tabs correctly, updating the `current_column` value based on the tab spacing requirements. It also ensures that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set correctly to handle tab characters following non-empty lines.
