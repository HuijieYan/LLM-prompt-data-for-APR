## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column while handling indentation, tabulation, and newlines properly. The function keeps track of the current line being built, the columns processed so far, and whether to wait for a newline character. There are some issues in the logic of the function, primarily related to updating `lines` and the conditions for handling different characters.

## Error Locations
1. Updating `current_column` is not consistent for characters like spaces and tabs.
2. The handling of characters to update `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` is not correctly done.
3. The logic to update `lines` is not proper, leading to incorrect slicing of the prefix.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation with tabulated comments after a dedent. This is due to the incorrect tracking of the current line and columns, leading to incorrect slicing of the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of indentation, spaces, tabs, and newlines. The function should correctly update the current line being built, keep track of columns, and update the `lines` list when necessary.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            else:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function ensures proper handling of characters, updates the current line and columns accurately, and correctly updates the `lines` list. This should fix the bug and address the issue reported on GitHub related to indentation changes in tabulated comments after a dedent.
