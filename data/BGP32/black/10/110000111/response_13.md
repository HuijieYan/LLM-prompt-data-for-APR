The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect calculation of the `current_column` value when encountering tabs (`'\t'`). It adds 4 to the `current_column` for each tab, which is not the correct behavior. The correct approach should be to calculate the next tab position based on the current position, so we need to adjust the `current_column` accordingly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic related to the tab character handling, specifically updating the `current_column` value. We should increase it to the next tab position instead of adding a fixed value of 4.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - current_column % 4)  # Adjusting current_column for tab position
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` value based on the next tab position. It should now satisfy all the expected input/output values and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to indentation changes after dedent with tabulated comments.
