### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column, handling a scenario where the prefix consists of multiple lines with varying indentation levels. It tracks the lines, current line content, current column position, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to manage the parsing logic.
2. The potential error locations are within the logic block where the function processes each character of the input prefix string.
3. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly handles the case where a newline character (`'\n'`) should not reset the current column to 0. This affects the correct generation of output lines based on the specified column, leading to incorrect formatting.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to accurately determine when to reset the column position. Specifically, the column reset should only happen when the condition to wait for a newline is not met, and the character is neither a space nor a tab.
5. The corrected function is provided below:

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the change to the handling of newline characters, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column without incorrect formatting issues.
