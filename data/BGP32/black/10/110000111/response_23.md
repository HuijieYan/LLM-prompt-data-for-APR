Based on the expected values and types provided for the buggy function, it seems the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters in the prefix string. This leads to incorrect tracking of the columns and lines.

The bug occurs when there is a mix of spaces and tabs within the prefix string, causing incorrect column counting and line splitting. The function misinterprets the indentation level, leading to the deviation from the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of handling spaces and tabs in the prefix string to ensure proper tracking of columns and lines based on the indentation. We should also properly update the variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to maintain the correct state during processing the prefix string.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should correctly handle a mix of spaces and tabs in the prefix string and properly maintain the line and column positions according to the expected behavior.

It is important to thoroughly test this corrected version with the provided test cases and verify that it resolves the bug described in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes.
