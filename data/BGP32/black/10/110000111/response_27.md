The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the incorrect handling of the indent level when encountering tabs. This leads to incorrect behavior when handling comments and whitespace, resulting in unexpected changes in the indentation level.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of tracking the current column based on the encountered characters. Specifically, when a tab character is encountered, we should increment the column by the appropriate amount (e.g., 4 spaces) instead of incrementing by 1 as done for a space character.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the indentation levels, including tabs, leading to the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent.
