### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value, taking into account spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The function seems to have issues with correctly calculating the indentation level and handling newline characters, resulting in incorrect behavior when dealing with tabs.

### Error Locations
1. The indentation level calculation with tabs (`\t`) is not correctly accounted for.
2. The logic for handling newline characters is not properly resetting the current column and line variables.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to incorrect calculation of the current column value with tab characters, resulting in improper alignment of comments when a dedent occurs. Additionally, the function does not properly handle the resetting of the current column and line variables when encountering a newline character.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
1. Update the logic for calculating the current column value when encountering tab characters.
2. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters to correctly reset the current column and line variables.

### Corrected Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4  # Adjust the tab width to match the expected behavior
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                
                current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes a fix for handling tab characters correctly and resetting the current column and line variables when encountering newline characters.
