After analyzing the buggy function and the expected input/output values, the issue arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels for tabulated comments after a dedent operation. The current implementation fails to properly handle tab characters when adjusting the indentation level.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle tab characters when calculating the column offset. We need to consider the correct tab width (usually 4 spaces) when incrementing the `current_column` variable.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_width = 4
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                tab_count = current_line.count('\t')
                current_column = tab_count * tab_width + len(current_line.replace('\t', ''))
            else:
                current_column += 1
                
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                # Skip incrementing current_column for spaces
                pass
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust current_column for tab characters
                current_column += (tab_width - 1)
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles tab characters by appropriately adjusting the `current_column` value based on the tab width. Now, the function should satisfy all the expected cases and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
