### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a part of a given prefix based on a specified column value. The function processes the prefix character by character and decides how much of the prefix to consume based on indentation levels. However, there are issues in handling the indentation and newline characters, resulting in incorrect prefix consumption.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation based on spaces and tabs.
2. Improper resetting of variables like `current_line` and `current_column`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the improper handling of spaces, tabs, and newline characters. The function fails to adjust the consumption of prefix correctly when encountering different indentation levels.

### Fix Strategy:
We need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the actual prefix based on indentation and newline characters. Handling tabs, spaces, and newlines appropriately will help in accurately consuming the prefix up to the specified column.

### Buggy Function - Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char != '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function ensures proper handling of spaces, tabs, and newline characters to consume the prefix up to the specified column. This should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values.
