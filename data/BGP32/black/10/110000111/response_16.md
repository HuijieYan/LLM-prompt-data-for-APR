### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column value considering whitespace characters in the prefix. The function has issues related to handling indentation correctly, especially with tabs.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The function does not correctly handle tab characters (`\t`) when calculating the current column value.
2. For case 5, after encountering a tab character in the prefix, the function only adds the tab character to the current line instead of consuming it fully according to the column value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters in the prefix while calculating the current column. The function improperly processes tabs, leading to incorrect indentation levels and misalignment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure correct handling of tab characters, properly calculating the column levels, and consuming tabs according to the column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4 # Align to next tab stop
        else:
            # indent is finished
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Justification:
1. Corrected the handling of `\t` characters by aligning the `current_column` to the next tab stop, ensuring proper indentation calculation.
2. Removed unnecessary append of tab characters to `current_line`.
3. Updated the logic to consume characters based on indentation correctly.

By applying these modifications, the function should now handle indentation and alignment, fixing the bug related to incorrect handling of tab characters.
