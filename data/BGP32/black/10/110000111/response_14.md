### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached. It maintains a list of lines and tracks the current line being built as well as the current column counter.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling tab characters is incorrect causing incorrect column count.
2. The current line is not appended to `lines` after encountering a new line character.
3. The function does not correctly update `current_column` after a new line.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of tab characters which is adding four spaces to the `current_column` instead of one. Additionally, the logic is flawed when encountering new lines and does not update the column accordingly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the logic for handling tab characters to increment the `current_column` by 1 instead of 4.
2. Append the `current_line` to `lines` when encountering new lines.
3. Update the `current_column` to 0 when encountering new lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Corrected: Increment by 1 instead of 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)  # Append current_line to lines
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the cases as expected and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue by correctly maintaining the indentation after dedents in the presence of tabs.
