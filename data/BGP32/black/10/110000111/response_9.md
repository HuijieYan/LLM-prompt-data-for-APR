The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues in handling the indentation levels when encountering tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect behavior as reported in the GitHub issue. The function fails to properly calculate indentation levels and update the `current_column` value accordingly, causing incorrect line breaks and indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the indentation levels based on tabs and spaces encountered in the prefix input. We should also adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` variable to accurately represent the current indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have updated the logic for handling tabs by adjusting the `current_column` value based on the existing indentation level and the number of spaces added by a tab character. This adjustment ensures that the indentation levels are accurately tracked, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

The function now properly handles tabs and spaces in the prefix input, maintaining correct indentation levels and line breaks as expected.
