Based on the provided information, the bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function of the `Driver` class. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column value is reached, preserving the consumed lines and the remaining prefix. The bug causes incorrect indentation handling, especially with tab characters, leading to unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation after dedent.

The bug is primarily caused by incorrect handling of tabs within the `prefix` string. The current implementation does not correctly account for tab characters and their equivalent indentation levels. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of updating it based on the tab level.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of tab characters to reflect the correct indentation levels. We should replace the fixed increment of 4 for tab characters with the appropriate calculation based on the tab width. Additionally, we should ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column position with respect to tab characters and other indentation whitespace to preserve the correct indentation levels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_width = 4  # Adjust this based on the actual tab width in the codebase
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have introduced the `tab_width` variable to dynamically adjust the column increment for tab characters based on the actual tab width in the codebase. By calculating the remaining spaces needed to reach the next tab position, the function can accurately track the column position when encountering tab characters, leading to correct indentation handling.
