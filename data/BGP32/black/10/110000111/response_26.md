### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a specific prefix string based on a given column value. It processes each character in the prefix string until it fulfills certain conditions related to indentation. However, due to the incorrect logic within the function, it fails to handle indentation properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bugs:
1. The `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables are not updated correctly, causing incorrect handling of spaces, tabs, and '\n' characters.
2. The function doesn't handle the scenario where the entire prefix string is processed without encountering a '\n' character.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the flawed logic where the function fails to properly handle the indentation level and correctly determine when to wait for a newline character. This issue results in incorrect behavior when processing the prefix string.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic within the function to correctly track the current column and waiting for a newline.
2. Ensure that the function adequately handles both space, tab, and newline characters to maintain proper indentation handling.
3. Make sure to handle cases where the entire prefix string is processed without finding a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                # Reset current column when not waiting for newline
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line between lines
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the given prefix string and maintain the intended column indentation.
