The bug in the provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to calculation of the current column when encountering tab characters '\t'. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` by 4 when a '\t' character is encountered, instead of updating it based on the next multiple of 8 which represents the tab size.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the calculation for updating the `current_column` value when encountering a tab character '\t'.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8  # Update current_column based on next multiple of 8
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function now properly handles the tab character '\t' by updating the `current_column` to the next multiple of 8, as expected in the case of tabs.

By applying this correction, the function should now work correctly and satisfy the expected input/output values provided for each test case.
