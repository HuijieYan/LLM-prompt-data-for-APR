The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of indentation levels and newline characters. When encountering a newline character, the current column count is reset to 0 which causes incorrect column tracking later on. This issue leads to incorrect indentation adjustment within the prefix string.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When processing a newline character, `current_column` should not be reset to 0 as it affects subsequent indentation calculations.
2. The function incorrectly handles calculating the current column based on tabs and spaces, leading to inaccurate column counting.
3. Insufficient logic to handle indentation in the case of mixed tabs and spaces.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Resetting `current_column` should only occur when encountering a newline character after actual content (not just spaces or tabs). This can be fixed by adjusting the conditions for resetting `current_column`.
2. Modify the logic for calculating the current column to accurately reflect the indentation level based on spaces and tabs in the prefix.
3. Implement a robust approach to handle mixed tabs and spaces for correct indentation tracking.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                continue
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces per tab, can be adjusted
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
                continue
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the issues with incorrect indentation handling by properly tracking the current column and adjusting it based on spaces and tabs in the prefix string.
