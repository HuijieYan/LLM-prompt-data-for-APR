### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix until a specific column is reached. It tracks the lines, current line, current column, and whether to wait for a new line.
2. The bug occurs when handling different characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines. The wait_for_nl logic does not correctly handle the situation to check if the current column has reached the target column.
3. The bug causes the newline character to reset the current column counter even if it is supposed to continue consuming the prefix until the target column is reached. This leads to incorrect indentation handling.
4. To fix the bug, the logic for checking the current column against the target column should be modified, and the handling of different characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines needs improvement.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the target column check when encountering newlines.
2. Adjust the handling of characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines to ensure proper prefix consumption until the target column is reached.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

### Note:
The corrected version of the function now correctly checks if the current column is less than or equal to the target column before consuming the prefix. The handling of different characters is adjusted to ensure correct indentation logic. This should resolve the issue with incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent as reported on GitHub.
