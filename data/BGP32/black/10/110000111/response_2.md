The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect indentation handling for comments after dedent operations. The function fails to handle tabs properly, resulting in indentation inconsistencies. The issue posted on GitHub highlights this problem with different indentation levels for comments compared to the code.

To fix this bug, we need to enhance the function's logic to correctly handle both spaces and tabs for indentation. We should ensure that comments align correctly with the code based on the specified column value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += '\t'
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version incorporates proper handling of spaces and tabs for indentation. It ensures that comments align correctly with the code based on the specified column value.
