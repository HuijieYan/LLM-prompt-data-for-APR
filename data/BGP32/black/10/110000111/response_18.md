### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume the prefix based on specified column indentation.
2. The function initializes variables for lines, current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl to track the consumption process.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of indentation levels and newlines.
4. The GitHub issue relates to incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments after a dedent in code formatting.

### Error Location:
1. The bug is likely within the if-elif-else block where character handling occurs.
2. Incorrect tracking of `wait_for_nl` and resetting of variables for new lines might lead to incorrect indentation behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of character indentation levels and newline characters. Specifically, the function does not properly reset `current_column` and `current_line` when encountering newlines, leading to incorrect behavior in indenting comments.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, `current_column` and `current_line` are properly reset to maintain the expected behavior of consuming the prefix based on the specified column indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ''
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version addresses the incorrect handling of newline characters and resetting of indentation tracking variables.
