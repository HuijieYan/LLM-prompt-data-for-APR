### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a given prefix string by partially consuming it based on the provided column parameter.
- The function iterates through characters in the prefix string and constructs lines of text based on indentation.
- The bug is related to incorrect handling of indentation when encountering tabs or spaces while constructing lines.
- The issue reported on GitHub describes a similar scenario where incorrect indentation occurs after a dedent, which aligns with the buggy function's behavior.

### Identified Errors:
1. Incorrect calculation of indentation based on tabs and spaces.
2. Incorrect handling of characters to determine the end of indentation.
3. Inconsistent handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to not resetting the `current_column` value after encountering a new line character (`\n`). This leads to incorrect indentation calculations and incorrect line construction.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Reset the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line character.
2. Update the logic for handling tabs and spaces to calculate the correct indentation level.
3. Ensure proper handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag to detect the end of the current indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indentation is finished when encountering non-space/tab character
            wait_for_nl = True

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Note:
The corrected version of the function addresses the issues related to indentation calculation and line construction. It ensures proper resetting of indentation levels and correct handling of tabs and spaces during text processing.
