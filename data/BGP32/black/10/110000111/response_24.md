The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has issues handling the indentation and newline characters in the input prefix string. The `wait_for_nl` flag seems to not reset properly, leading to incorrect behavior. Also, the calculation for `current_column` based on tab characters is incorrect.

To fix the bug:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag properly when encountering a newline character.
2. Update the calculation for `current_column` to include the correct count for tab characters.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update calculation for tab characters
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset the wait_for_nl flag and current_column on encountering newline
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_column = 0
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the prefix string with proper indentation and newline handling based on the provided test cases and also address the issue raised on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when tabs are used.
