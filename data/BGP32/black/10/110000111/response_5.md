### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value while handling indentation. The function processes each character in the prefix string and updates the current line, column, and other related variables accordingly. However, there are logical errors in handling indentation and newline characters which lead to incorrect processing in certain situations.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) may contribute to incorrect column updates.
2. Processing of newline characters (`'\n'`) and the reset conditions for `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` might not be functioning as expected.
3. The logic for checking column limits and preserving the prefix may be flawed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation when the prefix contains tab characters and dealing with newline characters, leading to inaccurate column tracking and line formation issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly update the `current_column` count based on different types of characters (spaces, tabs) encountered.
2. Ensure proper handling of newline characters by correctly resetting related variables.
3. Adjust the logic for calculating column limits and handling prefix preservation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections made in the `elif char == '\n':` block, the function should now properly consume the prefix based on the provided column value while handling different types of characters correctly. This updated version aims to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
