### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect indentation handling when encountering different kinds of whitespace characters. To fix this bug, we need to update the code logic to properly handle indentation with spaces, tabs, and new lines. Specifically, when we encounter a new line character after whitespace characters, we need to adjust the current_line and current_column accordingly. Additionally, we should update the conditions for setting wait_for_nl to ensure correct behavior. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust the number of spaces for tab character
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column > column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += '\n'
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected function should be able to properly handle various cases of input prefixes with different whitespace characters and indentation levels. This should address the issue of incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent as reported in the GitHub issue.
