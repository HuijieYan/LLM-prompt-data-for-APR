## Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix string up to a certain column value. The function attempts to break up the prefix into lines based on column width. The bug is related to maintaining correct column alignment when encountering different types of characters such as space, tab, or newline characters.

## Identified Errors:
1. The condition to check if `wait_for_nl` is set is misplaced. It should be before checking for tab or newline characters.
2. The return statement does not correctly adjust the consumed prefix based on the consumed lines.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of newline characters and incorrect updating of the consumed prefix. When encountering tab characters, the column width calculation is not appropriate, leading to misalignment of the lines.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic inside the loop to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the column width accordingly.
2. Move the condition to check `wait_for_nl` position for better control over the line creation process.
3. Adjust the return statement to return the correct remaining prefix after consuming lines.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version ensures that all characters, including tabs and spaces, are correctly processed to maintain proper alignment and handling of different line endings.
