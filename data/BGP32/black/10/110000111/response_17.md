## Analyzing the buggy function

The given buggy function is `_partially_consume_prefix` inside the `Driver` class. This function is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column width is reached, and then return the consumed part, and the remaining part of the prefix string.

The potential error locations within the function are related to the handling of characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, as well as the update of variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl`.

## Explaining the bug

The bug in the function causes incorrect handling of characters and columns when encountering spaces, tabs, or newlines. This can lead to incorrect indentation tracking. 

It is particularly noticeable in input cases where tabs are used. The handling of tabs and spaces results in unexpected behavior, especially after a newline character.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately track the column positions based on spaces and tabs, especially after encountering a newline character. The handling of characters and the update of variables should be adjusted to ensure correct indentation tracking.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                if current_column >= column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == '\t':
                    current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of different characters, especially tabs, spaces, and newlines, has been adjusted to ensure accurate column tracking. Tabs are now aligned correctly based on the column width. The logic for updating variables and checking column widths has been improved to address the bug.

This corrected version of the function should now accurately consume the prefix string up to the specified column width while maintaining correct indentation, as expected in the test cases and resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
