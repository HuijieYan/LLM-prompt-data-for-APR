### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix string based on indentation levels. The function processes each character in the prefix string and determines the indentation based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. The error occurs when there is a comment after a dedent, and the function incorrectly adjusts the comment's indentation.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks whether the function properly consumes the prefix string when a comment follows a dedent. The error message shows an assertion failure because the expected and actual output strings are different due to incorrect comment indentation.

The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where Black reformats comments after a dedent incorrectly, particularly when the input file uses tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after a dedent. It incorrectly adjusts the comment's indentation, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual output. This results in failing the test that checks for proper comment indentation handling.

The issue is related to how the function tracks indentation levels and newline characters, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering a comment following a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the function handles comments after a dedent. Specifically, we should ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation level after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                continue
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the conditional check `if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):` in the `elif char == '\n':` block, we skip adjusting the current column count if the line contains a comment. This change ensures correct handling of comments after a dedent. 

After applying this modification, the function should correctly handle comments, thus passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
