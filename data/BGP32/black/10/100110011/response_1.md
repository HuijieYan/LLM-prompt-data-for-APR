### Identifying the Bug

1. The `assertFormatEqual` function is comparing two different strings representing Python code with different styles of indentation (tab and space).
2. The error message shows that the expected and actual strings are different due to the incorrect handling of comments indentation.
3. The GitHub issue mentioned the specific scenario where the comment indentation is not handled correctly after a dedent operation.
4. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation level while consuming the prefix.

### Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not correctly tracking the column position when encountering comments in Python code. The function fails to maintain the correct indent level for comments after a dedent operation. This leads to incorrect indentation discrepancies when comparing tab-indented code with space-indented code.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_partially_consume_prefix` function correctly handles the indentation of comments while consuming the prefix string. Specifically, we need to make sure that the comment indentation is adjusted based on the current column position and any preceding tabs or spaces.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Adjust for comment indentation
            if current_column < column:
                current_line = current_line.lstrip()
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version, we add a check for `#` character in the string to adjust the comment indentation based on the current column position. This ensures that the comments align correctly with the surrounding code after dedent operations.
