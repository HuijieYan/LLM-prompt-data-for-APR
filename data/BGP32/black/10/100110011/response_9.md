### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a specified column in terms of indentation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to test the functionality of the indentation handling by comparing two versions of code and asserting their equality.
3. The error message indicates an `AssertionError` where the expected output does not match the actual output due to incorrect handling of comments and indentation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by how the `_partially_consume_prefix` function processes indentation while handling comments in the input code. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level changes caused by comments after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to properly track the indentation level and alignment of comments. Specifically, the function should correctly adjust the column number based on tabs, spaces, and newlines within the input prefix string.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the tab column count
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust column based on the newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Adjust column for regular characters
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column count correctly for tabs, spaces, and newlines in the input prefix string, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
