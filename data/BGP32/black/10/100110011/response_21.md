### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function is used to analyze the prefix of a string up to a certain column. 
2. The error in the function is related to how it handles spaces, tabs, and newline characters when calculating the current column position.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` tests the indentation behavior of comments on lines with different levels of indentation. The error occurs when the comment indentation is incorrect after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue mentioned a specific scenario where the comment indentation is changed incorrectly after a dedent due to problems with indentation handling in the code.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of `wait_for_nl` condition and character counts, resulting in incorrect column calculations and indentation. When encountering a comment after other characters, the function fails to maintain the correct column position.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the column position is correctly tracked for each character.
2. Properly handle different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to update the column position.
3. Adjust the logic to maintain the correct indentation level before and after comments.
4. Update the code to correctly handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False  # Track if in a comment block
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif in_comment:
            if char == '\n':
                in_comment = False
            current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            in_comment = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, you can correct the bug related to incorrect comment indentation. This revised version should now pass the failing test case and address the issue mentioned on GitHub.
