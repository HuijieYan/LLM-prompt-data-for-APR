### Analysis:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a string while maintaining column and line information. The issue is related to incorrect handling of indentation when encountering comments after a dedent.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is testing the behavior of the function when dealing with tabulated code and comments.

The error message indicates that the expected output and actual output do not match, specifically pointing out the difference in comment indentation after dedent.

The GitHub issue provides more context on how the bug manifests itself with the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.


### Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by the function not correctly preserving the indentation of comments in the case of tabulated code. When encountering comments after a dedent, the function fails to adjust the comment indentation properly.

This results in an incorrect output where the comment indentation is not aligned with the code indentation.


### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix` to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comment indentation aligns with the code indentation after a dedent operation in tabulated code.

We can add additional checks and conditions to correctly handle the indentation of comments based on the tab or space indentation of the code.


### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    indent = ''
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res + indent, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent = ''
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            indent += ' '
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            indent += '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            indent = ''
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected function, we keep track of the `indent` to preserve the indentation (either spaces or tabs) when encountering comments after a dedent. This adjustment ensures that the comment indentation aligns correctly with the code indentation, resolving the issue with tabulated comments after a dedent.
