### Analysis:
1. Error Location:
   The bug is located in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`.
  
2. Cause of the Bug:
   The bug is caused by incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments after a dedent. The function fails to consider the indentation of comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting of the code.
   
3. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to correctly handle the indentation levels for comments after a dedent. This involves ensuring that comments maintain the correct indentation level relative to the surrounding code.
  
4. Correction for the Buggy Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_column < column and not current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that comments maintain the correct indentation level relative to the surrounding code, especially after a dedent.

### After fixing the bug with the corrected function, the failing test should pass successfully.
