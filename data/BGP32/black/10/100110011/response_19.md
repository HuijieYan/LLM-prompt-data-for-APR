### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be incorrectly handling the indentation when encountering comments in the input prefix.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to check the behavior of the function with respect to comment indentation.
3. The error message indicates an assertion failure between the expected and actual output of the function when dealing with comments and indentation.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent is incorrect, which aligns with the behavior observed in the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs in `_partially_consume_prefix` function when it encounters a comment immediately after a dedent. The function does not correctly handle the indentation for comments, leading to incorrect output. This bug is causing the failing test to compare the actual output with an incorrect expectation, resulting in an assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments, especially when it follows a dedent operation. By adjusting the logic and conditions within the function related to comment handling, we can address the issue and align the behavior with the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle newline without reset for comments
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                lines.append(current_line)
            else:
                current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic within the function to correctly handle comments and their indentation, the corrected version should now produce the expected output and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
