### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` appears to be responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent in the input code.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking whether the function properly handles comment indentation in Python code.
- The error message indicates that the buggy function is failing to correctly maintain the indentation of comments.
- The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs in the input code.

### Potential Error Location:
- The condition `wait_for_nl` variable handling seems to be causing the incorrect behavior.
- Specifically, the `wait_for_nl = True` inside the `else` block might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is causing incorrect handling of comments after a dedent in the input code.
- The function does not properly track and adjust the indentation level when encountering comments after dedenting.
- This results in the incorrect output where comments are misaligned after dedenting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic in the `if char == '\n':` block to properly handle the situation where a newline character is encountered.
- Ensure that the function correctly tracks the current column and handles comments after dedenting.
- Modify the `wait_for_nl` handling to address the incorrect comment indentation issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Conclusion:
By updating the `_partially_consume_prefix` function's logic to properly handle comments after dedents and newline characters, the corrected version provided above should address the bug and enable the function to pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
