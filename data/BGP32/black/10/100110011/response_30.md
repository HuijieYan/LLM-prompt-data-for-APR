### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string until a certain column and line/column boundaries are met.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is trying to compare two different string contents after formatting.
3. The error message indicates an assertion error due to a mismatch between the expected and actual string content. This is due to incorrect handling of comments and indentation within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is affecting the result of the test.
4. The GitHub issue mentions a similar problem where the indentation for comments after a dedent is being changed incorrectly. This aligns with the test failing due to incorrect comment indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to incorrect handling of comments and indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, when encountering a comment after a dedent (reduction in indentation level), the function is not correctly adjusting the comment indentation. This inconsistency in handling comment indentation leads to a mismatch between expected and actual string content in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle comments and adjust their indentation based on the surrounding code.
2. Ensure correct handling of dedents and comments to maintain consistent formatting while consuming the prefix string.
3. Verify the function against the failing test case to ensure that comments are correctly indented after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    is_comment = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            is_comment = False
        elif char == '#':
            is_comment = True
        else:
            if char.isalpha() and is_comment:
                current_column += 1  # Adjust comment indentation
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the changes outlined above, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle comments and indentation appropriately to address the bug and pass the failing test.
