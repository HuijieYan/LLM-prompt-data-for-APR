### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `driver.py` file within the `blib2to3/pgen2` module.
2. The test function `test_comment_indentation` in the `test_black.py` file is failing due to incorrect indentation handling for tabulated comments.
3. The error message from the failing test points out the specific line where the assertion fails due to incorrect comment indentation.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, particularly when using tabs in the input file.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the improper handling of tab characters within the `prefix` string. It fails to account for tab characters (`\t`) when calculating the column positions, leading to incorrect indentation handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the column calculation to correctly handle tab characters (`\t`) and ensure that comment indentation after dedents is processed accurately based on the input content. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_line += ' ' * next_tab
            current_column += next_tab
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() != "" and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':  # increasing the column counter for whitespace
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':  # reset column count for newlines
            current_column = 0
        else:  # indent finished, waiting for newline
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections in place, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tab characters and comment indentation after dedents correctly, resolving the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
