### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming a prefix text until it contains a certain number of columns. The issue seems to be related to handling tabs and spaces differently when calculating the current column. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels and causes the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to fail.

### Error Location:
The issue likely arises from how tabs and spaces are processed within the function and how the current column is updated.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the function does not handle tabs and spaces consistently while calculating the current column. This inconsistency leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels, causing the failing test to report discrepancies in indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the way tabs and spaces are processed to provide a consistent method for incrementing the current column.
2. Ensure that both tabs and spaces contribute correctly to the column count.
3. Verify that the handling of indentation levels aligns with the expected behavior, ensuring proper comment indentation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making sure that the processing of tabs and spaces is consistent and accurately updates the current column, the corrected function should now handle indentation and comment alignment correctly, passing the failing test case and resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
