### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a part of the `driver.py` file in the `blib2to3` package and is responsible for processing prefix content to handle indentation correctly.
2. The test function `test_comment_indentation` in the `test_black.py` file tests the indentation functionality by comparing the expected output with the actual output of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`.
3. The error occurs when handling comments with different kinds of indentation (tabs and spaces) where the function incorrectly processes the indentation causing the test to fail.
4. The GitHub issue reported a related bug where indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent, confirming the bug in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from how it handles different types of indentation (tabs and spaces) and their impact on comment lines. The function does not correctly account for different indentation settings, leading to incorrect output and failed tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles both tabs and spaces for indentation while processing comments. By correctly updating the `current_column` and `lines` variables based on the type of indentation encountered, we can address this issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle tabs correctly by adjusting `current_column` to the next multiple of 4, we can ensure that the function processes both tabs and spaces consistently. This correction should resolve the indentation issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
