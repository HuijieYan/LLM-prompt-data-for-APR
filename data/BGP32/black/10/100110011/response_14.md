### Bug Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test function is failing due to incorrect handling of comments in the `contents_tab` variable.
2. The failing test is comparing the expected output `contents_spc` with the actual output generated from `contents_tab`.
3. The error message shows a specific line where the indentation for a comment is incorrect in the actual output compared to the expected output.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent, specifically when using tabs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `_partially_consume_prefix` function encounters a scenario where there is a comment after an indentation and dedent. It fails to correctly handle the indentation level for the comment and ends up with an incorrect output. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments after indentation changes. Specifically, the function should ensure that the correct level of indentation is maintained for comments even after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `elif char == '\n':` block and handling the correct indentation for comments after a dedent, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test.
