### Analyzing the buggy function:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix while maintaining the lines and columns count based on tab or space indentation. The problem lies in the logic of handling indentation, particularly the `wait_for_nl` condition.

### Identifying potential error locations:

1. Handling of `wait_for_nl` condition
2. Incorrect returning of the result

### Explanation of the bug:

The problem occurs when the function encounters a new line character (`\n`) and the `wait_for_nl` condition is set to `True`. In this scenario, the function wrongly identifies the start of a new line, leading to incorrect indentation handling. This results in misalignment of comments after dedent, as observed in the failing test and error message.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

To address the bug, we need to revise the logic related to `wait_for_nl` and ensure correct processing of new lines for maintaining proper indentation. Additionally, the function should correctly return the remaining prefix for further processing.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Move the 'wait_for_nl' check here
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function according to the corrected version provided above, the issue with misaligned comments after dedent should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully.
