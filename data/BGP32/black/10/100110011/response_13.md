### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test function is checking the indentation of comments after dedent, using spaces and tabs for indentation.
2. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are different due to incorrect handling of comments after dedent.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with changing comment indentation incorrectly after a dedent, especially when using tabs.
4. The `current_column` value in the function is not updated correctly when encountering comments, resulting in incorrect indentations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `current_column` value is not properly updated to reflect the column position after encountering a comment line.
- When encountering a comment line, the function does not adjust the `current_column` before appending the line to the list. This leads to incorrect indentation of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the `current_column` value based on the indentation characters encountered to ensure correct indentation handling.
- Adjust the `current_column` value before appending a comment line to maintain correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char.isalnum():  # Adjust column for regular characters
                current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrected version of the function, the `test_comment_indentation` should pass without any assertion errors.
