The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent. The issue arises due to the incorrect tracking of indentation levels when encountering comments. The function fails to maintain the correct column count when encounters tabs or spaces before the comment. This leads to a discrepancy in the output between spaces and tabs indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks the current column level while encountering different types of characters, especially tabs and spaces. By correctly updating the `current_column` variable, the function will maintain the correct indentation level and correctly identify when a comment needs to be shifted.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, resolving the issue observed in the failing test case.
