### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a string until a certain column is reached.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function when dealing with indentation and comments.
3. The error message shows that the function is not handling the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where indentation for comments using tabs is changed incorrectly after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not handling the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent operation. Specifically, when the code encounters a comment after dedenting, the function is not maintaining the correct column position for the comment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedenting.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a check for `#` to the else block, we can correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. This fix should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
