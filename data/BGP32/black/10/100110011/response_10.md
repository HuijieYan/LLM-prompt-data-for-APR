### Correction:

In the provided code snippet, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function has a bug that is causing issues with the indentation of comments. The problem arises when there is a comment after an indented block, and the indentation is not maintained properly after a dedent action. This issue has been reported on GitHub with more detailed information under the title "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent."

#### Bug Explanation:
- The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent action, particularly for tabulated code.
- The incorrect handling results in the comments being misaligned with the rest of the code content, leading to failing test cases.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` correctly maintains the indentation levels, especially when encountering comments after dedents. Adjusting the 'wait_for_nl' condition along with proper tracking of the column position should help resolve the issue.

#### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    current_indent = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_indent < column:
                # Check if the current line has content (not just spaces)
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_indent = current_column

            # Reset the line content after newline
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            # Indent is finished, wait for newline
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # Indent is finished, wait for newline
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic and tracking the current indentation level correctly, this version of the function should maintain the correct indentation levels for comments after dedents, fixing the reported bug.
