### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the input `prefix` based on certain conditions related to whitespace characters. It is used to parse lines of code in the `driver.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the functionality of formatting comments with indentation levels in `black.py`.
3. The error occurs when the comment's indentation after a dedent is not correctly handled, leading to an incorrect comparison in the test.
4. The bug appears to be related to how the function consumes whitespace characters and detects when to wait for a newline.
5. The GitHub issue mentions that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent when using tabs in the input file, which aligns with the bug description.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the function `_partially_consume_prefix` consumes whitespace characters (tabs and spaces) but fails to correctly handle comments' indentation after a dedent operation. This misalignment results in incorrect output when formatting code with comments.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario where a comment follows a dedent operation. This involves adjusting how whitespace characters are consumed and tracked within the loop to maintain proper comment alignment.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # Check if additional indentation is required
                current_line += ' ' * (column - current_column)  # Adjust indentation
                current_column = column  # Update column count
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

Applying this correction to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should address the bug and align the comment indentation correctly after a dedent operation. This correction should resolve the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.
