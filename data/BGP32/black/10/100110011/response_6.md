### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of the input string based on indentation rules. It processes characters in the prefix string and builds lines based on the indentation level.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is testing the behavior of the function with different indentation scenarios.
3. The failing test is comparing expected and actual output strings, raising an `AssertionError` due to incorrect handling of comment indentation after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `_partially_consume_prefix` function improperly handling comment indentation after a dedent operation. When a dedent occurs in the input prefix, the function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level for comments, leading to incorrect output.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how comment lines are handled after a dedent operation. When a dedent happens, the function should ensure that any following comments are correctly aligned with the same level of indentation as the code lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ''
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ''
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By handling the newline character separately to adjust the current line and store it in the `lines` list, we ensure that comments following a dedent operation are correctly aligned. This correction should resolve the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
