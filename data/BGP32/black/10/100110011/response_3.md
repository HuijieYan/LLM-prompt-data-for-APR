### Analysis:
1. The `test_comment_indentation` test function is checking if the function `fs` formats the input correctly.
2. The failing test is comparing the formatted output of the function `fs` with the expected output using `assertFormatEqual`.
3. The error message indicates that the actual formatted output does not match the expected output due to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent when using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not preserving the correct indentation for comments after dedent when using tabs. It is incorrectly handling the whitespace characters and their corresponding column counts.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic of `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the indentation for comments and preserve the intended formatting.
2. Make sure that the function accounts for tabs and spaces when calculating the column counts to maintain correct indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prefix_iter = iter(prefix)

    for char in prefix_iter:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Account for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        if current_column > column:
            while current_line.strip() and current_column > column:
                char = next(prefix_iter)
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    break

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle tabs, spaces, and indentation levels, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now preserve correct comment indentation after a dedent. This fix addresses the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
