### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on certain conditions related to indentation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks for correct indentation of comments within Python code.
3. The error message highlights the assertion failure due to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
4. The GitHub issue relates to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of comment indentation when transitioning from a higher indentation level to a lower one. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to account for this specific scenario, resulting in incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix` to correctly handle the edge case where comment indentation is affected by dedenting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Fixing the issue related to comment indentation
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition `if char == '#'` and setting `wait_for_nl = False`, we ensure that the function correctly handles the case when encountering a comment character '#' after dedenting.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue stated on GitHub related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
