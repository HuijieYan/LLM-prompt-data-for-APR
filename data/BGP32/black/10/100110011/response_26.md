### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to partially consume the prefix until a certain column number is reached. The issue seems to arise from incorrect handling of tab characters '\t'.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the indentation of comments in Python code snippets both with tabs and spaces. The error message indicates that the comparison between expected and actual results fails due to a discrepancy in indentation.
3. The cause of the bug is related to the incorrect handling of tab characters in the prefix consumption algorithm, leading to incorrect indentation when reformating. This aligns with the GitHub issue description of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent when using tabs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how tab characters are counted in the calculation of the current column position to account for their impact on indentation.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            tab_size = 4  # Assuming a tab is equal to 4 spaces
            current_column += tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
        else:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab character handling and ensuring proper counting for indentation, this corrected version should resolve the issue related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.
