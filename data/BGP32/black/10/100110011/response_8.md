### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering comments.
2. Incorrect handling of whitespace characters.
3. Not considering the scenario when the comment is at the same level as the next code block.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to the incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent. When encountering a comment with tabs, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level if the comment is at the same level as the next code block. This leads to incorrect reformatting of the code, causing the test to fail.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes the input prefix and handles the indentation when encountering comments. Specifically, we should ensure that the comment indentation matches the next line's indentation level correctly, considering both tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    comment_indent = None
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                comment_indent = None
                
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if comment_indent is not None:
                current_column = comment_indent
            comment_indent = None
        elif char == '#':
            comment_indent = current_column
        
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected version of the function, we keep track of the comment's indentation level and adjust it accordingly when encountering a newline. This ensures that the comment indentation matches the next line's indentation level, fixing the issue with tabulated comments after a dedent.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test related to tabulated comments' indentation.
