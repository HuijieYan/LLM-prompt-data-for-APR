### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming a prefix until a certain column. It handles different types of characters such as spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatted output of input with tabs against the expected output with spaces, specifically focusing on handling comments and indentation.
3. The error message shows an assertion error indicating a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output after formatting.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific scenario where the indentation for comments is being changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when the input uses tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when dealing with tabs, spaces, and newline characters while consuming the prefix. This results in incorrect calculation of the current column and handling of whitespace characters, leading to a deviation in indentation in certain cases like the one described in the failing test and GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic related to handling tabs, spaces, and newline characters to ensure correct calculation of the current column and preservation of indentation.
2. Check the conditions for wait_for_nl and handle different scenarios involving the indentation of comments and subsequent code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the handling of tabs within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as mentioned above, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case while addressing the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
