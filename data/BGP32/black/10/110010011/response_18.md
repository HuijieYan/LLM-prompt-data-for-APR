Analyzing the buggy function:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function iterates through each character in the `prefix` string and handles indentation and newline characters to preserve the original formatting. The goal is to consume characters until reaching a new line. However, there is a bug in the logic that leads to incorrect behavior when encountering comments.

Identifying potential error locations:
- The issue seems to be related to handling comments and their indentation. The function should correctly handle comments and their alignment within the code structure.

Explaining the bug:
- The bug causes incorrect indentation for comments after dedents. The failing test specifically highlights this issue with tabulated comments not being aligned correctly after dedents.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
- One approach to fixing the bug would be to adjust the logic within the function to correctly maintain the indentation level for comments. Special consideration should be given to how comments are processed after dedents.

Corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making adjustments to how comments are handled and ensuring proper indentation levels are maintained, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should resolve the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
