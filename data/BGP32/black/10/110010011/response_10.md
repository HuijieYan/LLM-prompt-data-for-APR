### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for incorrectly consuming text until a specified column, affecting the indentation of comments within the text.
2. The potential error locations are within the logic of calculating the indentation and consuming the text based on the specified column.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the correct level of indentation when encountering a comment after a dedent. This leads to the misalignment of comments, as reported in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly track the indentation level relative to the specified column, ensuring that comments are aligned appropriately after a dedent.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current column after each newline
            current_column = 0
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Indentation is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` after each newline and correctly handling the indentation logic, the corrected version of the function should now align comments correctly after dedents. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
