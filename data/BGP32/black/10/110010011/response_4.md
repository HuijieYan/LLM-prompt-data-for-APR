### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`.
2. The function is responsible for handling indentation in Python code.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is related to incorrect handling of comments after dedent for tabulated code.
4. The GitHub issue mentions a similar problem where Black reformats tabulated comments incorrectly after a dedent.
5. The issue arises due to incorrect indentation handling within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Error Cause:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handles the wait_for_nl condition leading to incorrect indentation for comments after dedent. This results in failing the test case related to comment indentation in tabulated code.

### Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the conditions within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation before and after comments.
- Specifically focus on the logic related to waiting for new line characters and handling tabulated indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # correctly handle indentation after dedent for comments
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the handling of tabulated comments after dedent within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
