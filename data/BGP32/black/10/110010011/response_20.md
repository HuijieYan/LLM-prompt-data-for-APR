### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of a class `Driver` and is responsible for handling indentation in a specific context. The error message from the failing test indicates a discrepancy in the behavior of the function related to comments and indentation.

The GitHub issue provides a detailed description of a similar problem where indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent operation, specifically when tabs are used in the input file.

### Potential error locations:
1. Handling of comments with different levels of indentation.
2. Incorrect calculation of indentation level.
3. Inadequate recognition of tab characters.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug can be attributed to the way the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is tracking indentation levels and handling new lines. Specifically, there seems to be an issue with how the function interprets comments following an indentation level change.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling comments after a dedent operation.
2. Ensure correct calculation of the indentation level for both spaces and tab characters.
3. Implement a check to maintain consistent indentation for comments in relation to the code.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        previous_char = ''
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if previous_char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            
            previous_char = char
        
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        
        lines.append(current_line)
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for handling comments after dedent operations, maintains correct indentation levels using tabs and spaces, and ensures that comments are indented correctly in relation to the code.
