### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling partial consumption of a prefix string based on indentation levels.
- The test failure is due to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent.
- The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem with tabulated comments after a dedent.
- The error message shows a specific example where the comment indentation is incorrect after dedent.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue may be related to how the function handles tabulated characters and newlines.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters tab characters ('\t') during indentation tracking. It incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of handling it as one character.
- This incorrect handling leads to wrong indentation comparisons and results in misaligned comments after dedent.

### Fixing Strategy:
- Update the handling of tab characters ('\t') to correctly adjust the `current_column` by 1 character at a time during indentation tracking.
- Keep track of the actual indentation level based on spaces and tabs to ensure correct alignment.
- Make sure that comments are correctly aligned based on the determined indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust current_column by 1 for each tab character
                current_column += 1
                while current_column % 4 != 0:
                    current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
- The fixed version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t') during indentation tracking.
- By adjusting `current_column` by 1 for each tab character and aligning comments based on the correct indentation level, the bug should be resolved.
- This correction should ensure proper handling of tabulated comments after a dedent and align with the expected behavior.
