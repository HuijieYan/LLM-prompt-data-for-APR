### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of comments in the given code. The issue reported on GitHub is related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The error message from the failing test shows a specific case where the comment indentation is not being preserved correctly.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic to handle waiting for a newline character is causing incorrect behavior.
2. The code is not handling the indentation level for comments properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that fails to correctly handle the indentation level for comments. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function does not adjust the indentation level as expected, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the indentation for comments. Specifically, we need to ensure that comments are appropriately aligned based on the code structure.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        in_comment = False

        for char in prefix:
            if in_comment:
                current_line += char
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    in_comment = False
                continue

            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                in_comment = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a flag `in_comment` to track if the current character is part of a comment.
2. Modified the logic to handle comments separately from other characters.
3. Adjusted the indentation handling for comments to align properly with the code structure.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments, resolving the reported issue.
