### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on indentation levels.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is failing with an assertion error related to comment indentation after a dedent.
3. The bug is related to how comments are handled in the string prefix based on indentation levels, which results in incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the problem with comment indentation when using tabs for indentation in the input file.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function causes incorrect handling of comments after dedent operations. This leads to discrepancies in comment indentation levels, especially when tabs are used for indentation in the input file.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic related to handling comments, especially after dedent operations. The function should correctly maintain the indentation level for comments to align with the code blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
1. Modified the logic related to handling comments after dedent operations.
2. Added a check to maintain the correct comment indentation level in the prefix string.
3. Adjusted the condition to handle comment indentation alignment with code blocks after dedent.
4. Ensured correct slicing of the prefix string based on indentation levels.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle comment indentation issues, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue and passing the failing test.
