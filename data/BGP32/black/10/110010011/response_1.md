### Analysis:
1. The `partially_consume_prefix` function within the `Driver` class is responsible for handling indentation levels and processing text content.
2. The error message is about incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent operation, specifically related to tabs.
3. The bug is causing incorrect handling of comments indentation after a dedent operation, leading to formatting issues particularly when tabs are used in the input.
4. The fix strategy involves ensuring that comments after a dedent operation retain the correct indentation level, especially when tabs are involved.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation levels for comments after a dedent operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The key change in the corrected version is the modification of the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering a tab (`\t`). This change ensures that the tab indentation level is correctly calculated.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now handle the comments indentation after a dedent operation effectively, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
