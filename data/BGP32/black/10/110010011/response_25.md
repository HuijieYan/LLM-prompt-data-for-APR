### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is designed to partially consume a prefix based on the given column index.
2. The error message indicates that the indentation for comments is not handled correctly after dedent in the `test_comment_indentation` test case.
3. The GitHub issue provides more insight into the problem, stating that tabs are used for indentation and after a dedent, the comment indentation is incorrect.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation. This leads to incorrect alignment of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.
1. Properly track the current column position.
2. Handle the indentation of comments based on the column position.
3. Ensure that comments are correctly aligned with leading whitespace.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl on newline
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl if non-whitespace character encountered
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag appropriately and considering the correct column positions, the corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly.
