### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used for partially consuming a prefix and handling indentation.
2. The function seems to incorrectly handle indentation when encountering comments after an indent.
3. The failing test indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically related to comment indentation.
4. The GitHub issue points out a similar problem with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent in code using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to properly calculate and maintain correct indentation levels for comments, especially when dealing with tabs and dedents. This leads to incorrect formatting and mismatch in the test results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure accurate tracking of column positions and indentation levels.
2. Handle different types of whitespace characters consistently.
3. Update the logic to correctly account for comments in the context of indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the column increment for tab characters and refining the logic for handling different whitespace characters, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedents.
