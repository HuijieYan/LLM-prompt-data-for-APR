### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class, responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on certain conditions.
   - The error occurs when handling indentation and newline characters within the prefix.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - Incorrect handling of newline characters.
   - Inconsistent updating of `current_column`.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs due to the inconsistent handling of newline characters and the update of `current_column` within the loop. This leads to incorrect behavior when processing newline characters following specific conditions.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Ensure that the `current_column` is updated correctly for all characters, especially newline characters.
   - Adjust the logic related to detecting newline characters and updating line splitting.
   - Refactor the loop to handle all conditions in a consistent and clear manner.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in (' ', '\t'):
                current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the issues related to handling newline characters, updating `current_column` consistently, and ensuring correct splitting of lines.
