### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming the prefix (input string) until a certain column is reached. The bug seems to be related to handling the indentation of comments, especially in the presence of tabs.

The test case `test_comment_indentation` is failing due to a difference in the expected output of formatting between tab-indented and space-indented strings.

The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where indentation for comments in code using tab indentation is incorrectly changed after a dedent operation.

### Potential error locations:
1. Handling of tabs and spaces while calculating column positions.
2. Logic related to detecting comments within the prefix string.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of tab characters compared to spaces when calculating column positions in the input string. When a comment is encountered after a dedent, the function fails to adjust the column position correctly, leading to incorrect indentation for comments.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the logic for handling tab characters and calculating column positions to ensure consistency between tabs and spaces.
- Adjust the logic for detecting comments to consider the correct column position and handle indentation properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of tab characters by aligning with the spaces equivalent to 4 spaces during column position calculation. It also improves the logic for comment detection and indentation adjustment, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
