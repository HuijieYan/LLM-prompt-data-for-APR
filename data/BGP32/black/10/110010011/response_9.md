### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix while preserving correct indentation. The issue arises when there is a comment at the end of an indented block, causing incorrect indentation.
2. The potential error locations in the function are the logic related to handling comments and whitespace.
3. The cause of the bug is that when a `wait_for_nl` flag is set due to encountering a non-whitespace character, if later a newline character is encountered within that same indentation block, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0, which leads to incorrect indentation in following lines.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug involves properly storing and updating the `current_column` value even when encountering newline characters while preserving the correct indentation level.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = column  # Update current_column to maintain the correct indentation
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent should be resolved.
