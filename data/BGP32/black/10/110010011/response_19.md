### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a provided column value. The function goes through each character in the prefix, tracking the current line, column position, and whether it needs to wait for a new line.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrectly checking for the end of a line.
2. Incorrectly handling the indentation level.
3. Issues with handling tabs and spaces for indentation.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes incorrect behavior when handling comments after a dedent in the input code. The issue is related to improper handling of whitespace characters (tabs and spaces) while calculating the current column position.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of indentation levels.
2. Correctly track the position of the cursor.
3. Adjust the logic to properly handle different types of whitespace characters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if not wait_for_nl:
                current_line += char
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle the indentation and comments in the input code.
