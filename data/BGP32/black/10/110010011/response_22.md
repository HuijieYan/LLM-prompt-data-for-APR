### Analyzing the buggy function:

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is within the `Driver` class and is responsible for processing a given prefix string, adjusting the indentation level based on spaces, tabs, and new lines. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of the indentation level for comments after a dedent.

### Potential error locations:

1. Incorrect logic for determining the indentation level when encountering a comment after a dedent.
2. Inconsistent handling of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) and new lines.
3. Possible issue with how the function updates the current line and processes the lines list.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug is causing incorrect reformatting of comments that should be at the same indentation level as the next line after a dedent. This results in failing test cases where the expected and actual outputs do not match.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the indentation level and handles comments after dedents properly. This may involve adjusting the logic for checking whitespace characters, tabs, and new lines, as well as how the function processes the current line and lines list.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust tab size to 4 as per PEP8
            elif char == '\n':
                if wait_for_nl:  # Adjust indentation after dedent for comments
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Add current_line to lines list
                    current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
                    current_column = 0  # Reset current_column
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments after a dedent and ensure proper indentation calculations, we should be able to fix the bug and pass the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
