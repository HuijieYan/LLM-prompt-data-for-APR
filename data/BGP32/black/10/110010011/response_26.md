### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates a failed test related to comment indentation.
2. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix text and handling whitespace characters.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments after dedenting, as described in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are properly aligned at the correct indentation level after dedenting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the logic related to handling of comments and their indentation levels.
- Update the function to correctly handle the indentation levels for comments after dedenting.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        next_line_indent = None  # Track next line indentation for comments

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    next_indent = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip()) if current_line.strip() else None
                    if next_indent is not None and next_indent <= column:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                        next_line_indent = next_indent
                    else:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if next_line_indent is not None:
                    # Adjust next line's indentation if a comment follows dedent
                    current_column = next_line_indent
                    next_line_indent = None
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now handle the indentation levels of comments correctly after dedenting, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
