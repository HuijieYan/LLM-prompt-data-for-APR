### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a bug related to handling comments and indentation.
2. The error message from the failing test in the GitHub issue indicates a difference in how comments are handled.
3. The GitHub issue describes a scenario where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent.
4. The bug is likely caused by an issue in tracking and maintaining correct indentation levels when encountering comments after an indent change.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code.
6. The expected behavior is to maintain the same level of indentation for comments as the code they are associated with.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Maintain the correct indentation level for comments by tracking the current column and handling the indentation changes properly.
2. Ensure that comments are aligned with the code based on the indentation level.
3. Modify the logic of handling comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to address the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_closed = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column and not indent_closed:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent_closed = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            if char == '#':
                indent_closed = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we ensure that comments are correctly aligned with the code based on the indentation level. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
