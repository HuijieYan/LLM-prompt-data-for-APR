### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
2. The bug is related to incorrect handling of comment lines followed by an indent level adjustment.
3. The bug is causing incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation, leading to failing tests due to formatting mismatches.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are correctly aligned based on the provided column number during processing.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function does not handle the case where a comment line is encountered after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect indentation for comments in specific scenarios.
- The current implementation does not properly track the column information when encountering comment lines after an indent change.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly process and adjust the indentation for comment lines based on the specified column number.
- Ensure that comments are aligned correctly with the corresponding code lines after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and align comments properly after dedent operations, ensuring that the failing test is now successful.
