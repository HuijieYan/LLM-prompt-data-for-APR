### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a part of the `Driver` class in the `driver.py` file of the `blib2to3/pgen2` module.
2. The function is responsible for consuming a prefix string until a specific column position is reached, handling tabulation and newline characters.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is asserting the format equality of two strings with different comment indentation, causing an assertion error.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar indentation bug related to tabulated comments after dedent in the Black code formatter, which matches the behavior seen in the failing test.

### Identified Error:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles tabulation and newline characters when consuming the prefix string. This mismatch in handling results in incorrect comment indentation in the output, causing the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Cause:
- The function does not correctly handle the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tab characters.
- The logic for waiting for a newline character is triggered prematurely, leading to incorrect line splitting and eventually causing the comment indentation issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the calculation of `current_column` when encountering tab characters to correctly account for the indentation level.
- Modify the logic for waiting on a newline character to trigger only after correct indentation, ensuring proper line splitting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            # Adjust current_column for tab characters
            next_indent = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += next_indent
            current_line += ' ' * next_indent
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 1  # Consider other characters as 1 space
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the corrections mentioned above, the fixed `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle tabulation and newline characters correctly, resolving the indentation issues and passing the failing test.
