### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on the given column. However, the function has issues related to handling tab characters and indentation detection.

### Identified error locations:
1. The handling of tab characters (`\t`) is causing issues with column calculations.
2. The logic for detecting and maintaining proper indentation levels is flawed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of tab characters, which should increase the column count by 4 but is currently increasing it by 1. This leads to incorrect column tracking and results in improper indentation detection after dedent operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly increment the column count by 4.
2. Adjust the logic for maintaining the correct indentation level when encountering tabs and newline characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column count on new line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the column increment logic for tab characters and properly resetting the column count for new lines, this corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
