### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the given prefix string based on the specified column value.
2. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the indentation for comments correctly after a dedent operation.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a similar problem where the indentation for comments is changed incorrectly after a dedent operation when tabs are used in the input file.
4. The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles different characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) and the logic for determining when to wait for a newline character before deciding the indent level.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to correctly handle the scenarios where the comments should maintain the same level of indentation.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation for comments after a dedent operation.
2. Ensure that the comments are correctly aligned based on the column value specified.
3. Consider the characters such as spaces, tabs, and newlines to accurately determine the current indentation level.
4. Update the function to maintain the correct indentation levels for comments in the output.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle comment indentation
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    current_column = column
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check to handle comments and set the current column to the specified `column` if the line starts with a comment character (`#`).
2. This modification ensures that comments maintain the correct indentation level according to the specified column value.

By implementing the corrected version, the function should now handle comment indentation correctly after a dedent operation, addressing the reported issue.
