### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on certain conditions related to indentation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the expected output with the actual result and asserting for equality, but the bug causes a mismatch.
3. The bug is mentioned in the GitHub issue titled "Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent". The issue describes how comments with tabs are not properly maintained in terms of indentation.
4. The bug occurs when there is a comment following an indented block, leading to incorrect indentation for the comment.
  
### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from how the function handles different characters while iterating over the prefix. When encountering spaces or tabs, the function updates the `current_column` count for indentation. However, the logic around `wait_for_nl` for handling newlines after an indent is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when dealing with comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Adjust the logic around `wait_for_nl` to properly handle newlines.
2. Make sure that the comment indentation matches the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
3. Update the function to correctly consume the prefix while maintaining the expected output format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in {' ', '\t'}:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug related to comment indentation should be fixed, and the test case should pass without any issues.
