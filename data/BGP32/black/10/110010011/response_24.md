### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on the specified column.
- The error message is related to an issue with comment indentation after a dedent operation.
- The bug causes incorrect behavior when handling comments after dedents, leading to unexpected indentation changes.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of comments after dedent operation.
2. Incorrect calculation of indentation level.
3. Failure to correctly skip over certain characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment after dedent operation. The function fails to appropriately adjust the indentation level for the comment line, resulting in incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic inside the function to correctly handle comments and adjust the indentation level when encountering them after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
                if wait_for_nl and char == '#':  # Adjust indentation for comments
                    current_column = column  # Set indentation level to column
    
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including the condition `(wait_for_nl and char == '#')` inside the `else` block, we enable the function to adjust the indentation level appropriately for comments following dedent operations. This should resolve the bug and ensure correct formatting as expected by the failing test case.
