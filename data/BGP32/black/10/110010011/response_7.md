### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Buggy Class**: The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class within the `driver.py` file. This function is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on indentation rules.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of comments with tabs in the input. This results in incorrect comment indentation after a dedent.

3. **Cause of Bug**: The bug is caused by the way the function handles different types of characters ('\t', '\n', ' '). The current implementation does not cater to the specific scenario where a comment follows a dedent with tabs.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to correctly handle comments following a dedent, especially when tabs are involved.
   
5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (((current_column - 1) // 4) + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes an adjustment in the handling of '\t' character while updating the `current_column` to ensure that comment indentation after a dedent with tabs is addressed correctly.
