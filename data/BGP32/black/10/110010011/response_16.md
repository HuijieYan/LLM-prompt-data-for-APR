### Analysis:
**Buggy Function**:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string until a certain column is reached or certain conditions are met.

**Potential Error Locations**:
1. The logic for updating `current_column` is incorrect.
2. The logic to handle tabs and spaces is not consistent.
3. The handling of new lines and indentation is causing the issue.

**Cause of the Bug**:
The bug is likely being caused by the incorrect handling of the `current_column` variable and the inconsistent handling of tabs and spaces. This results in improper indentation of comments after dedent.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
1. Ensure that the `current_column` is updated accurately based on the character being processed.
2. Have consistent logic for handling tabs and spaces to calculate column positions correctly.
3. Refine the logic for handling new lines and indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update current_column based on tab width
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function includes adjustments to handle tabs more consistently and update the `current_column` accurately based on the character processed. This should resolve the issue with incorrect comment indentation after dedent.
