### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function appears to process a given prefix string to partially consume it based on a specified column. It identifies lines in the prefix based on indentation levels determined by spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

### Issues
1. The function fails to correctly handle cases where multiple lines need to be consumed partially at different column levels.
2. There is a potential issue in the calculation of columns for lines when there are tabs involved.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the implementation failing to properly account for the continuation of lines based on the specified column. This leads to errors in identifying the correct indentation levels and affects the final output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should be revised to accurately track and consume prefix content based on the defined column levels. This can be achieved by updating the logic for handling different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) and ensuring correct column calculations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the function should now properly handle cases with different indentation levels and consume the prefix content accordingly. This should lead to passing the failing test cases.
