### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit while handling newline characters appropriately. The bug seems to be related to handling newlines within the prefix string.

### Error Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly treat newline characters, resulting in unexpected behavior when consuming prefixes up to a specific column limit.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles newline characters in the prefix string. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function resets the column count correctly when encountering newline characters.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adding the handling of newline characters within the else block, we ensure that the function correctly resets the current column count when a newline character is encountered. This fix addresses the bug identified and should now pass the failing test cases.
