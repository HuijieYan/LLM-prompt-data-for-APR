### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix by checking the indentation of the input text. It maintains state variables like `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to keep track of the current indentation level. However, the logic in the function seems to have a bug related to handling newline characters and updating the variables correctly.

### Error Identification
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl` is True). In this case, instead of resetting all the necessary variables, the logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing incorrect results when the function tries to handle newline characters, especially in cases where there is a comment following an indented line (`# comment`). The incorrect handling results in the failure of the test case `test_comment_indentation`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline, the function correctly resets the necessary variables. This involves updating `current_line`, `current_column`, and resetting `wait_for_nl` appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the function should handle newline characters correctly and pass the failing test case.
