### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit. However, there are issues in the logic which causes the function to incorrectly handle line breaks and indentation. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares formatted strings and fails due to incorrect indentation handling.

### Issues
1. Incorrect handling of line breaks and indentation, leading to incorrect results.
2. Inconsistent handling of spaces and tabs causing wrong column increments.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function incorrectly handling line breaks and indentation levels. This results in inconsistent column counts leading to incorrect partial consumption of the prefix.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that line breaks are properly handled to reset the column count.
2. Implement accurate column count increments for spaces and tabs to maintain correct indentation tracking.
3. Adjust the logic to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column limit.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle line breaks, reset column counts correctly, and increment columns accurately for spaces and tabs, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
