### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a portion of a prefix string based on a provided column value. The function iterates through the prefix string character by character, keeping track of the current line, current column, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to handle indentation.

The bug in the current implementation arises from the condition checking for the newline character (`\n`). When encountering a newline character, the current column is reset to 0, which disrupts the indentation handling logic. This results in incorrect prefix consumption and mismatched outputs compared to the expected values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the logic for handling the newline character needs to be improved. Specifically, we need to adjust how the function handles indentation levels when encountering newline characters.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                if current_line.strip():  # append lines only if non-empty
                    lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # reset current column
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the current column value only for newline characters and appending lines only when they are non-empty, the corrected function ensures that the prefix consumption is aligned with the expected behavior outlined in the test cases.
