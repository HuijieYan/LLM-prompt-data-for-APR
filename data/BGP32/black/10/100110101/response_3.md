### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix character by character until a specific column is reached. It accumulates the consumed characters into `lines` until it reaches the target column, then returns the consumed characters as well as the remaining characters in the prefix.

### Bug
The bug in the function causes incorrect handling of the prefix when encountering a newline character. Specifically, it does not handle the situation where the newline character is expected but not found. This leads to the failure in the test case `test_comment_indentation`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when a newline character is expected but not encountered. We also need to ensure that the function updates the necessary variables (`lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`) consistently.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After fixing the bug in the function, it should pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
