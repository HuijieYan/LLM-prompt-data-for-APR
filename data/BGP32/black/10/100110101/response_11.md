### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a prefix string based on indentation levels. The issue seems to arise from incorrect handling of whitespace characters (space and tabs) and newline characters in relation to the given column number. It fails to properly separate lines based on the column number provided.

### Identified Issue:
The main issue arises from the conditional logic inside the `for` loop, which does not handle the indentation level and newline characters accurately.

### Bug Cause:
1. When encountering a newline character, the current column is reset to 0, which disrupts tracking the indentation level.
2. Incorrect modification of `lines` list and `current_line` string.
3. Inconsistent increment of `current_column` based on different whitespace characters.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the loop to handle whitespace characters properly, update tracking of `current_column`, and ensure correct separation of lines based on the specified column number.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Check if current line should be included
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic to correctly handle indentation levels and newline characters, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
