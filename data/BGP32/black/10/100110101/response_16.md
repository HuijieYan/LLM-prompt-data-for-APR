The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` lies in the logic related to handling spaces, tabs, and newlines for updating the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags. In some cases, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified `column` value, resulting in an incorrect output.

The bug causes the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to produce an assertion error because the expected and actual outputs do not match due to the incorrect handling of indentation. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified `column` value by considering spaces, tabs, and newlines properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # <= instead of <
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # newline encountered
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fixed version modifies the condition checking for `current_column` against `column` when returning the extracted prefix. Now the function should consume the prefix correctly up to the specified `column` value, ensuring that the test `test_comment_indentation` passes.
