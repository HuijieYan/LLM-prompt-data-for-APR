### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a given prefix until the specified column is reached. It seems to have an issue where it fails to correctly consider the indentation level.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to compare different text indentations, highlighting the expected comment indentation with respect to spaces and tabs. The error message shows a mismatch due to incorrect handling of tab characters in the function.

### Identified Issue:
The bug seems to be related to how the function handles tab characters in the input prefix. The function increments the `current_column` variable by 4 for each tab character, which is incorrect. This discrepancy leads to the incorrect representation of text indentation, causing the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the `current_column` value accordingly. The function should treat tabs as moving to the next multiple of 4 columns (since tabs are often used as equivalent to 4 spaces in indentation).

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            next_tab_stop = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            for _ in range(next_tab_stop - current_column):
                current_line += ' '
                current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By utilizing the `next_tab_stop` calculation to advance the `current_column` appropriately when encountering a tab character, this corrected function should now handle indentation levels correctly, ensuring the expected behavior for the failing test.
