### Analysis
The provided function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a given column, taking into account spaces, tabs, and new lines. The function seems to have a bug related to handling new lines and waiting for a new line character before continuing. This bug leads to inconsistent behavior when parsing prefixes that include comments.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the premature declaration of `wait_for_nl` as `False`. This leads to gaps in handling new lines, causing the function to progress incorrectly before fully processing a line with a comment in certain cases. As a result, the function does not correctly consume prefixes containing comments, leading to the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, `wait_for_nl` should be set to True only when encountering a non-space, non-tab character after tabs or spaces. Additionally, the logic for processing new lines should be refined to handle comments correctly while considering the desired column position.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue
            
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these fixes, the function should now correctly handle prefixes with comments and satisfy the expected input/output variable values for all provided test cases.
