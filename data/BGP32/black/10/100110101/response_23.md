### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters until a specific column is reached after indent. However, the bug occurs when encountering a new line character '\n' while waiting for a new line after the indent is finished. This leads to an incorrect handling of newlines in the prefix, causing the indentation level to be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. When encountering a new line character while waiting for a new line after the indent is finished, it should reset the current line and column count.
2. Adjust the logic to properly handle the characters and newlines during indentation detection.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset line and column
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function should now handle the new line characters correctly during the detection of indentation levels, leading to the expected behavior and passing the failing test cases.
