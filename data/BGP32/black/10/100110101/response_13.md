### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logical error when handling indentation levels and waiting for a new line character. This error is causing mismatched results in the test function `test_comment_indentation`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issues seem to arise from how the function initializes and updates variables related to tracking the current line, current column, and the need to wait for a new line. Specifically, the logic used to determine whether to handle indentation or wait for a new line needs to be adjusted.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters, spaces, and new line characters in the `prefix` string. When the function encounters a tab character followed by a comment (in the failing test case), and the column value is not yet reached, it fails to correctly process the indentation level. This results in a different output than expected, leading to assertion errors in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic for updating the current column, identifying when to wait for a new line, and correctly processing the indentation levels needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the function needs to handle tab characters correctly to ensure the correct indentation level is maintained.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - current_column % 4  # Handle tab indentation correctly
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset flag on encountering new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab character processing inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the function should now handle indentations correctly and pass the failing test cases successfully.
