### Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column while handling whitespace characters properly. The bug seems to be related to the handling of whitespace and newlines within the prefix string.

### Error Cause:
1. When encountering a newline character (`\n`) in the prefix string, the current column counter is not reset to 0. This causes the bug where the returned string does not adhere to the specified column.
2. The logic for indentation level detection fails when encountering multiple tabs or spaces, leading to incorrect handling of whitespace characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the current column counter is correctly reset to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. Improve the logic for whitespace character handling to accurately determine the column position.
3. Modify the loop to handle cases where multiple spaces or tabs are present.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Final Thoughts:
The corrected function should now properly handle whitespace characters, including tabs and multiple spaces, while ensuring that the returned string aligns with the specified column position. These changes should address the bug encountered in the failing test case.
