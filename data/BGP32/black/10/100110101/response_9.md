From the provided buggy function and failing test, the issue seems to be related to how the function handles the indentation levels and line breaks. Specifically, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentations and line breaks within the prefix string.

The main cause of the bug seems to be the incorrect handling of newlines and indentation levels. The function should keep track of the current column position properly while processing the characters in the prefix string. Additionally, it should correctly identify when a line break is encountered and reset the current column accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly updates the current line and column position based on the characters it encounters. We should address the handling of spaces, tabs, and newlines differently to maintain proper indentation levels. Also, we need to correctly check and update the flag `wait_for_nl` to handle indentations and new lines in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if wait_for_nl:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the function correctly handles indentation levels, spaces, tabs, and newlines within the prefix string. It updates the current line and column position based on the encountered characters and correctly resets them when necessary.

With this corrected version, the function should pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
