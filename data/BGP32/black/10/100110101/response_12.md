The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is that it is not correctly handling the indentation levels when encountering a newline character. This results in incorrect line concatenation and column counting. To fix this bug, we should adjust the logic related to handling newline characters and updating the indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to reset `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` when encountering a newline character, we ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels and line concatenation. This corrected version should now pass all the expected test cases provided.
