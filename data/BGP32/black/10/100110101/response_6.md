### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specific column value. However, the current implementation has a bug causing it to fail in certain scenarios as seen in the failing test. The bug seems to be related to handling indentation and waiting for a new line.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test scenario of `test_comment_indentation`, when `contents_tab` is passed to the function, it fails to correctly handle the indentation before the comment line. Specifically, it fails to consume the initial leading tabs before the comment line.

The bug occurs because when a tab character is encountered, the `current_column` is only incremented by 4 instead of considering the actual count of tabs. This leads to incorrect indentation handling and causes the function to return an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function handles tab characters. Instead of incrementing `current_column` by a fixed value of 4 for tabs, we should count the number of tabs encountered and appropriately update `current_column`. This way, the function will accurately track the indentation level and consume the correct amount of characters before the comment line.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
            while current_column % 4 != 0:
                current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating how tab characters are handled in the function, we ensure that the correct number of characters are consumed before the comment line. This correction should allow the function to pass all the provided test cases and correctly handle the indentation levels in the input prefixes.
