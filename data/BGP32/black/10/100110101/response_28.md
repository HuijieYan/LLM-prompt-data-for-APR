The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation levels and newlines in the input prefix. When a newline character is encountered while waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl` is True), the current line should be checked for the correct indentation column. However, in the existing code, this check is not correctly considering the existing indentation.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling newline characters and indentation levels. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly calculates the indentation of each line in the prefix and accounts for the expected column value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # check current_line for valid indentation
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and newlines in the prefix, satisfying the expected input/output values mentioned earlier. This should now make the failing test case pass successfully.
