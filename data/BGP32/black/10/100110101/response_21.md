### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` seems to be designed to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column, preserving the indentation of the lines. The function tracks the current line, the column number, and whether it needs to wait for a new line before consuming further characters. The bug appears to be related to the handling of whitespace characters and newlines.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` highlights the discrepancy in the indentation of comments between the expected output and the actual output. This indicates that the function does not handle comment lines correctly when they are separated by multiple spaces or tabs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment line starting with a space character, followed by more space characters or tab characters. The current implementation treats these subsequent spaces or tabs as adding to the column count, causing the indentation to be miscalculated. As a result, the preserved lines do not align correctly with the given column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct how the function handles whitespace characters, especially when a comment line contains multiple tabs or spaces. We should ensure that the indentation levels are correctly calculated based on the specified column. We can achieve this by adjusting how the `current_column` is updated and how the function distinguishes between actual indentation spaces/tabs and the start of a new line.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By explicitly handling whitespace characters within the conditions inside the `for` loop, especially newlines, we ensure that the function correctly calculates the indentation levels. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
