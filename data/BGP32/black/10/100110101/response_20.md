### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column. It processes characters in the prefix string and constructs lines based on column indices.
2. The function has issues with handling line breaks (`\n`) and indentations (`\t`, `' '`) correctly.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates that the function doesn't handle line breaks between indentation and comments properly, leading to a formatting difference and the test failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address how the function handles line breaks, indentations, and waiting for new lines within the prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is primarily caused by incorrect handling of line breaks (`\n`). When a line break is encountered in the input prefix string, the function resets the current column without correctly adding the current line to the overall lines list. This causes incorrect indentation tracking and formatting issues.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify how the function handles line breaks within the prefix string, ensuring that the current line is properly included in the lines list whenever a line break is encountered.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle line breaks and indentations in the prefix string, allowing it to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
