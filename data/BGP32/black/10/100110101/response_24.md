The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column width, handling indentation levels and line breaks. The function seems to have a bug in the logic that detects the end of an indentation block and correctly determines when to return the consumed prefix.

The bug appears to be related to how the function handles waiting for a newline character to signal the end of an indentation block. In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly consume and return the given prefixes with the expected indentation and comments. This discrepancy leads to an assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic where the function waits for a newline character to correctly handle the scenario when the column width is reached before the newline. Ensuring that the function correctly identifies the end of the block facilitates the proper consumption of the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Modified condition to include the equal sign
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation` and correctly consume the prefixes up to the specified column width as expected based on the provided cases.
