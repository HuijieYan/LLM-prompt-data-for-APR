### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column, considering indentation in the form of spaces and tabs. The function seems to be failing due to incorrect handling of whitespace characters when reaching newline characters and the subsequent lines.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character after consuming whitespace characters. It fails to properly reset the `current_column` counter and continues to accumulate lines for the output without considering the specified column limit. This results in incorrect output when the test compares the expected and actual values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, the function resets the necessary variables to start processing the next line correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip()) < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version resets `current_line` and `current_column` appropriately when encountering a newline character, ensuring that the indentation processing starts fresh for each new line.
