### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is meant to consume a portion of a prefix string based on a given column number. However, there are bugs present in the function that cause it to incorrectly handle newline characters and columns.

### Bugs
1. The function does not handle cases where a prefix has multiple newline characters in a row correctly.
2. Formatting issues in the output like multiple spaces or tabs before comments are not handled accurately.

### Bug Cause
The function mishandles the newline characters when updating the `current_column` value, leading to incorrect checks for column positions. Additionally, the function does not properly handle spaces, tabs, and newlines in the given prefix, resulting in formatting discrepancies.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Adjust the logic for handling newlines to correctly reset the indentation column.
2. Make sure to properly handle cases where spaces, tabs, and newlines are interspersed in the prefix string.
3. Update the logic to correctly determine when the indentation for a line has finished in a multi-line case.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle multi-line prefixes with correct column positioning.
