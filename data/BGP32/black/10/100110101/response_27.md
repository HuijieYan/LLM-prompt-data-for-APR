### Analysis
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume characters from a prefix string until a certain column is reached.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling newlines and indentation in the prefix string based on the failing test case.
3. The bug occurs when processing the prefix string where a comment is expected to be aligned with a certain column. However, the function fails to keep track of the column correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column count is updated correctly after processing each character, especially when encountering newlines and whitespace characters.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Maintain a correct count of the current column position in the prefix string.
2. Update the column count appropriately when encountering newline, space, or tab characters.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where a comment should be aligned at a specific column in the prefix.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these modifications, the corrected function should behave correctly according to the expected cases provided.
