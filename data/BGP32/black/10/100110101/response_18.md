### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column limit, typically dealing with indentation in code. The bug seems to be related to handling indentation levels and newlines.

### Bug Explanation
The function fails to correctly handle the presence of a comment in some cases, resulting in incorrect indentation when converting tabs to spaces. This bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for a newline or when indentation is finished.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling comments and newlines, ensuring that the correct indentation level is maintained. We should also fix the way the lines are built and returned to avoid losing indentation levels.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function should now properly handle comments and maintain correct indentation levels when converting tabs to spaces. It should pass the failing test cases provided.
