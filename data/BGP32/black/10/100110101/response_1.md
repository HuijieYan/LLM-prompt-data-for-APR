### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a given prefix while ensuring that a certain column rule is followed. The function loops through each character in the prefix, adding it to `current_line` and checking if it needs to wait for a new line before proceeding. However, there seems to be an issue with how the function handles indentation and new lines, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug
The bug appears to be related to how the function updates the `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` variables. Specifically, when encountering a `\n` character, the function is resetting `current_column` to 0 even if there is no indentation rule violation. This leads to incorrect results when comparing the partially consumed prefix.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should only reset `current_column` to 0 if there was an empty line. Otherwise, we should keep track of the indentation level as expected. We can achieve this by updating the `current_column` only when necessary. 

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This fixed version should now correctly handle the indentation rules and partially consume the prefix as intended, passing all the expected test cases.
