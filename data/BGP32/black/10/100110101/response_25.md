### Explanation:
The bug is occurring because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly handling the newline character (`'\n'`) when it encounters it. This causes the function to miss the intended behavior of consuming characters until a newline character is found.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the handling of the newline character to correctly update the state of the function.
2. Make sure that the current line is added to the `lines` list only after checking the column condition.
3. Update the `wait_for_nl` flag as needed to ensure correct behavior.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments in the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
