### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume characters from a prefix string while keeping track of the indentation level. It fails to properly handle cases where there is a comment before the end of the line, resulting in incorrect indentation handling.

The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is designed to check if the indentation is correctly preserved when there is a comment in the line. The error message indicates a mismatch between expected and actual output due to incorrect handling of comments.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a comment (lines starting with `#`). It fails to properly handle the case where the comment appears before reaching the specified column, causing the indentation levels to be incorrectly adjusted in the returned output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle comments within the prefix string. Specifically, we should ensure that comments are not considered in the indentation calculations until the specified column is reached.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column and '#' not in current_line:  # Ignore comments for indentation check
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version updates the logic to accurately handle comments and indentation checks. Comments are now excluded from affecting the indentation levels until the specified column is reached, thus preserving the correct formatting.
