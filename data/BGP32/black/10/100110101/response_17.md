### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a provided column size. The function seems to have an issue with handling spaces and tab characters that affect the calculation of the current column position. This could lead to incorrect prefix consumption and hence incorrect output.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the code, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output values. This indicates a problem with the way the function handles indentation levels.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect calculation of the current column position when encountering tabs (`\t`) and spaces (`' '`). The function calculates the current column position using a fixed increment of 1 for spaces and 4 for tabs, which does not reflect the actual indentation level.

For example, when encountering `\t# comment\n\t`, the function incorrectly sets the `current_column` to 1 instead of 8, leading to an incorrect output. Similarly, the function incorrectly handles `\t\t# comment\n\t`, further accentuating the issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should adjust the way the `current_column` is calculated based on the encountered characters. Tabs should increase the column position by multiple of 4, while spaces by 1. Only resetting the `current_column` when encountering a newline character is not sufficient, as the incorrect column value may affect the prefix consumption logic.

Additionally, the handling of when to wait for a newline character should be based on the correct calculation of column positions.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Update column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling the column positions for tabs and spaces, as well as resolving the newline waiting condition, the corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
