### Fixing the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to arise from incorrectly updating the `current_line` in certain cases, specifically when encountering a newline character. This leads to an incorrect handling of the indentation and causes the function to return an unexpected result.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how `current_line` is updated when encountering a newline character. Instead of resetting `current_line`, we should update `current_line` and its related variables based on the indentation level. Additionally, we need to ensure that the logic for handling the indentation and newline characters is consistent.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the indentation and newline characters according to the expected behavior outlined in the provided test cases.
