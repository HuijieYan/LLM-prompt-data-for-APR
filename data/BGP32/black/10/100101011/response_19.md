### Error Analysis:
1. The current implementation of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handles the indentation logic, especially concerning tabs and spaces.
2. The function fails to correctly detect the indentation level within the input prefix, leading to incorrect behavior when handling comments and dedentations.
3. The bug causes a misalignment between comments and code after a dedent operation, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function's improper tracking of the indentation level when encountering tabs and spaces. This results in incorrect adjustments to the prefix, leading to the misalignment of comments and code.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for tracking the current column taking into account both tabs and spaces.
2. Ensure correct handling of indentation and dedentation scenarios to align comments correctly with the respective code blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.strip():
                    # Unexpected empty line
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle both tabs and spaces in the input prefix, ensuring correct alignment of comments with the code, especially after dedentations. Additionally, this fix should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect indentation changes for tabulated comments.
