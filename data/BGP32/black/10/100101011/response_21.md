### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is parsing through a prefix string character by character, handling indentation based on spaces, tabs, and newlines. The bug lies in the logic related to waiting for a newline after encountering non-space/non-tab characters.

### Error Location:
The main issue is with the condition checking for `wait_for_nl` and the behavior associated with it.

### Cause of the Bug:
When encountering a non-space and non-tab character while waiting for a newline, the function mistakenly transitions to waiting for a newline before fully processing the current line. This premature transition results in incorrect line indentation handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to when to wait for a newline to ensure proper line indentation and handling.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset the wait flag
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline and only transitioning to waiting for a newline after finishing processing the current line, the corrected code should handle line indentation correctly.
