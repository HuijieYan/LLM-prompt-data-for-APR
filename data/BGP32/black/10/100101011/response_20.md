### Analysis:
The `partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle consuming a prefix string until a specific column number is reached. The buggy behavior seems to arise from incorrect handling of indentation levels when encountering comments. The function incorrectly handles the indentation level of comments after a dedent operation, causing the issues in the failing tests.

### Error Location:
The cause of the bug seems to be in the logic related to handling comments and their indentation levels upon encountering newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly maintain the indentation level after dedent operations when encountering comments. This leads to incorrect parsing and mismatched indentation levels, as seen in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should maintain the correct indentation level for comments, especially after dedent operations, to align them properly with the structure of the code.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle comments indentation alignment
            if not current_line.strip().startswith("#"):
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now correctly handles the indentation level of comments, ensuring proper alignment after dedent operations. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing tests related to comment indentation.
