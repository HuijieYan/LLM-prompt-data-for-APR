### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix based on column constraints. The function is likely failing due to incorrect handling of tab characters and column tracking. The function should consider the number of spaces tabs represent when calculating the current column.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the issue is related to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces. The current implementation of `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly track the effect of tabs on column calculations, leading to incorrect behavior in handling and indentation of comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the current column calculation to correctly handle tabs and spaces. When encountering a tab character, we should increment the current column by the appropriate number of spaces to ensure correct indentation tracking. Additionally, the function should correctly handle the scenario where a comment is present after a dedent, ensuring proper indentation.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab handling and column calculation within the corrected function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test should pass correctly.
