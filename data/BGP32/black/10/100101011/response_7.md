### Bug Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` aims to consume a part of the prefix up to a specific column while maintaining the line structure correctly in terms of indentation. The bug seems to occur when processing lines containing comments since the function fails to handle the correct indentation for such cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises due to the mishandling of lines containing comments, which leads to incorrect indentation adjustments after dedent operations. The function logic fails to consider the actual column position after consuming the prefix for cases where comments are involved, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle lines containing comments and their associated indentation in the presence of different types of characters. It should accurately track the column position while consuming the prefix, especially in scenarios involving comments.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Handle comment indentation
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line as comment starts on a new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By including an additional condition to handle comments appropriately and resetting the line information accordingly, this corrected function should now address the bug and allow the test cases to pass successfully.
