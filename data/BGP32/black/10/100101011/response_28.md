### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume and process a prefix string based on certain indentation rules. The issue seems to be related to incorrect handling of column indentation when encountering comments in the prefix.

1. In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the issue arises due to the function not correctly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent.
2. The bug is likely triggered when a comment line has indentation spaces/tabs that are not consistent with the previous lines' indentation level.
3. The bug results in incorrect handling of comment indentation, leading to inconsistent formatting when the code is passed through the `fs` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent. This involves correctly tracking the indentation level and aligning comment lines accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column and '#' not in current_line:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if '#' in current_line:
                wait_for_nl = True  # Allow further indentation after comment
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that after encountering a comment line, the function allows for further indentation and aligns subsequent lines accordingly.

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly handle comment indentation after a dedent, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
