### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to handle the consumption of prefixes with specific column constraints. The issue arises when dealing with tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect indentation, primarily when tabs and spaces are mixed.

In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, when working with a prefix containing mixed tabs and spaces like `'\t# comment\n\t'`, the buggy function fails to calculate the correct indentation levels and causes incorrect behavior.

The problem mainly stems from the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces within the loop, impacting the calculation of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` statuses.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this issue, we need to ensure that the handling of tabs and spaces is consistent while calculating the indentation level. It's crucial to unify the logic for tab and space handling to accurately determine the column position.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            # Update column based on spaces
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update column based on tabs
            current_column = (current_column + 8) // 8 * 8  # Align to next tab stop
            current_line += '\t'
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic for handling tabs and spaces, this corrected version should properly calculate the indentation levels and pass the failing test case related to indentation issues with mixed tabs and spaces.
