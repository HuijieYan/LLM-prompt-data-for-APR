### Error Identification
The `current_column` value is not updated correctly in the buggy function when encountering a `\t` character. This bug causes incorrect dedentation behavior for tabulated comments after a dedent, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the incorrect updating of the `current_column` variable when encountering a `\t` character. This leads to misaligned indentation for comments after a dedent.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly update the `current_column` value for each `\t` character encountered in the prefix string.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the `current_column` value properly when encountering a tab character `'\t'`, the corrected function will align tabulated comments correctly after a dedent as expected.
