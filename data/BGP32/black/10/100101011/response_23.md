### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a part of the input prefix based on indentation level until a certain column is reached. However, there are issues with how it handles indentation levels, especially with tab characters. The function does not account for the correct column calculations when encountering tab characters, leading to incorrect behavior for tabs.

### Error Locations:
1. Improper handling of tab characters in calculating the current column.
2. Incorrect logic for accounting for tab characters in the indentation calculations.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the discrepancy in handling tab characters for column calculations. Since the function increments the current column by a fixed amount for every tab character (`current_column += 4`), the actual column position can be different when tabs are present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the column calculation logic to correctly handle tab characters in the input prefix.
2. Ensure that tab characters are accounted for when determining the column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            spaces = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces
            current_line += ' ' * spaces
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying the corrections above should address the tab-related indentation issue and align the implementation with the expected behavior.
