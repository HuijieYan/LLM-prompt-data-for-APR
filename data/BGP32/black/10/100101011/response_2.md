### Bug Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle the consumption of indentation from a given prefix based on a specified column. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of tab characters ('\t'). The core issue lies in the calculation of the `current_column` within the function, which results in incorrect indentation handling for tab characters in certain scenarios.

### Error Locations:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Tab Characters:** The function increments `current_column` by 4 for each '\t' character encountered. However, this does not reflect the actual indentation level as each tab character should represent a single level of indentation.

### Cause of the Bug:
Analyzing the failing test and the runtime values at the function's return, the bug becomes apparent when dealing with tab characters for indentation. The incorrect increment of `current_column` by 4 for each '\t' causes a mismatch between the expected and actual indentation levels, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should correctly count tab characters as a single level of indentation. Adjust the increment of `current_column` for '\t' characters to 1 to align with the expected indentation behavior accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1  # Adjust for correct tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment to increase `current_column` by 1 for each encountered tab character, the corrected version should now handle tabulated indentation correctly and align with the expected output provided in the failing test, fixing the bug related to tab characters' incorrect indentation handling.
