### Error Identification:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle scenarios where the comments are preceded by tabs instead of spaces, leading to incorrect indentation after dedent operations.
2. The variable `wait_for_nl` doesn't reset properly after encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect identification of newline characters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect handling of tab characters and maintaining the state of `wait_for_nl`, resulting in incorrect indentation logic after multiple nested levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the column calculation logic to account for tab characters properly.
2. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character to ensure accurate newline detection.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_size = 4

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_size - (current_column % tab_size)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the column calculation logic to handle tab characters correctly and resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now accurately consume the prefix text while maintaining the correct indentation levels for comments.
