### Issues:
1. The `wait_for_nl` flag is not being reset after processing a newline character, leading to incorrect behavior when processing subsequent characters.
2. The `lines` variable is not being handled correctly after processing the `wait_for_nl` condition, resulting in missing lines or incorrect tracking of lines.
3. The logic for handling indentation levels with spaces and tabs needs to be adjusted to ensure consistent behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after processing a newline character, causing it to incorrectly trigger the `wait_for_nl` condition for subsequent characters. This results in missing lines and incorrect processing of indentation levels.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after processing a newline character to ensure correct handling of subsequent characters.
2. Adjust the logic related to the `lines` variable to correctly track and append lines when needed.
3. Modify the indentation calculation logic to handle spaces and tabs consistently.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset flag and handle line tracking
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag after processing a newline character, adjusting the line tracking logic, and ensuring consistent handling of indentation levels with spaces and tabs, the corrected function should address the identified issues and align with the expected behavior.
