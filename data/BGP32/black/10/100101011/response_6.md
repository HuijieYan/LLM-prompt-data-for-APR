### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition for checking if wait_for_nl is True and if the char is '\n' might not be triggering as expected.
2. The logic for handling the indentation levels and waiting for a new line might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly maintain the indentations when processing comments after a dedent in the input code. This leads to incorrect indentation levels for comments, especially when using tab characters for indentation. The bug causes the comments to be aligned differently than expected, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation logic when encountering comments after a dedent. It should ensure that comments are aligned correctly based on the indentation level of the surrounding code block.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic inside the condition block for '\n', the corrected function ensures that comments are correctly aligned based on the specified column parameter. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure proper comment indentation after a dedent, especially when using tab characters.
