### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle partially consuming a prefix considering different indentation types like spaces, tabs, and new lines.
2. The function seems to incorrectly handle the scenario where a comment follows an indented block with a different level of indentation.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates that the comment indentation is not maintained correctly, especially when it follows a different level of indentation block.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function tracks the current column and line indentation levels while consuming the prefix and handling new lines or tabs differently.
5. The GitHub issue confirms a similar problem where the comment indentation is impacted after a dedent operation, especially with tab indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when the function encounters a newline character `\n` while consuming the prefix, it resets the current column without properly handling the scenario where the next non-empty line may have a different indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels when encountering new lines after a dedent operation. Consider the relative indentation levels between the comment and the following line to align them properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if '\n' in prefix:
                if prefix.find('\n') > prefix.find('#'):
                    alignment = prefix[:prefix.find('#')].count(' ' * 4) * 4
                    current_column = alignment
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle the indentation alignment correctly after a dedent operation, the corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test for comment indentation.
