### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to incorrect handling of the indentation level for comments when encountering a dedent. This bug results in the incorrect alignment of comments, especially when using tabs for indentation. The issue mentioned in the GitHub report describes a similar problem where comments should maintain the same indentation level as the following line of code after a dedent, but the function fails to preserve this behavior.

### Bug Location:
The issue arises when there is a dedent followed by a comment in the input prefix. The function's logic to detect the end of indentation (`wait_for_nl`) does not correctly handle scenarios with comments and mistakenly advances the indentation level when it shouldn't.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle comments during the dedent process correctly. This involves ensuring that the comment indentation aligns with the next line of code after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
                if prefix.startswith(' '):
                    current_column = len(current_line.replace('\t', ' ' * 4))
                wait_for_nl = False
            continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes modifications to properly handle comment indentation after a dedent. It ensures that the comment indentation aligns with the next line of code, addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
