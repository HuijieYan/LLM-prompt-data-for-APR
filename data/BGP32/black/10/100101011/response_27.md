### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume the input prefix based on a specified column in terms of indentation. However, the bug seems to cause issues with tabulated comments after a dedent. The function incorrectly handles tabulation and space indentation, leading to incorrect output indentation levels for comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect output due to the mishandling of tabulation and space indentation, specifically in the presence of comments. The function fails to account for the proper identification of when to wait for a newline after indentation. As a result, the column detection logic does not align with the intended behavior for tabulated comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify when to wait for a newline character based on the indentation levels specified in the input. Adjustments in the logic for tracking the column and accounting for different indentation types (tabs vs. spaces) are necessary to ensure correct handling of comments after a dedent.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Note:
The correction involves adjusting the handling of tabulation (\t) for the `current_column` variable to align with the actual indentation levels and ensure proper newline wait conditions for comments after dedents. This correction should address the bug related to tabulated comments and indentation issues.
