### Issue Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of text up to a certain column limit based on the indentation levels. However, the logic involving `wait_for_nl` and handling of newline characters is causing incorrect behavior.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` aims to check if comments maintain correct indentation levels when specified in the input text.
3. The given runtime input/output values show that the function is not handling the newline characters and their implications on indentation properly, leading to incorrect results.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights a specific case with tabulated input text where comments' incorrect indentation occurs after a dedent operation, similar to what the failing test signifies.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of newline characters and the logic related to `wait_for_nl`. When encountering a newline character, the function resets the current column to 0, which leads to incorrect indentation calculation when dealing with comments or other content following the newline.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic related to handling newline characters to account for proper indentation levels.
2. Ensure that after encountering a newline, the function correctly evaluates the indentation based on the previous context and maintains consistency.
3. Refactor the logic to handle sequential lines and comments with correct indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = column  # Adjusted to maintain the correct column after newline
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True  # Update to indicate waiting for the next line's indentation context
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True  # Mark the end of the current indentation level

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the indentation logic related to newline characters and ensuring proper treatment of comments after dedent operations, the function should now handle the input scenarios correctly, passing the failing test and addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
