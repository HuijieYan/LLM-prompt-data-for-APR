### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to the handling of indentation and newline characters. The function is designed to partially consume prefixes of lines, considering indentation and comment lines. However, the logic to correctly handle both tabs and spaces is flawed, leading to misaligned comments after dedent operations. The bug is related to the interpretation of spaces and tabs, which is essential for maintaining proper indentation levels.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely present in the handling of tab characters (`'\t'`) and spaces (' '). The incorrect increment of `current_column` based on these characters, along with the logic for `wait_for_nl` and newline handling, causes the incorrect output alignment for comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to ensure correct handling of tabs and spaces for indentation. Specifically, we should accurately update `current_column` based on the character type being processed. Additionally, proper management of newline characters and the conditions for resetting `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags is crucial for the correct functioning of the function.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False

        if char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabs, spaces, and newline characters, as well as properly updating `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` flags, this corrected function should now accurately maintain the expected indentation levels. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment alignment after dedenting.
