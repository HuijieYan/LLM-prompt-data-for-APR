### Error Identification:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle tab characters correctly, leading to incorrect indentation.
2. The implementation does not properly account for the tab character when calculating the current column.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from not accurately tracking the number of columns when encountering tab characters in the prefix. This results in incorrect indentation that affects the comments after a dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional statements that handle tab characters to correctly adjust the `current_column` value based on the tab width.
2. Ensure that the `current_column` is updated appropriately to reflect the actual indentation level, especially after encountering tab characters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # Assuming a standard tab width of 4 spaces
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            continue
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correct handling of tab characters and adjusting the `current_column` based on the tab width, this corrected version of the function should resolve the incorrect indentation issue described in the GitHub issue.
