### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to handle the indentation correctly while consuming the prefix in the string.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of whitespace characters and new lines during the consumption of the prefix.
3. The failing test suggests that after dedent, the comment indentation is changed incorrectly.
4. The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to handle the situation when a newline is expected. However, it doesn't reset correctly in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag in various conditions. In specific cases where the comment follows a dedent, the flag is not reset properly, leading to issues with maintaining the correct indentation level for comments.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is appropriately set and reset based on the encountered characters during prefix consumption. This involves correctly handling whitespace characters and new lines to maintain the expected behavior for comments after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset current_column for new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly when encountering a new line, we ensure that the function handles the indentation for comments after a dedent accurately.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
