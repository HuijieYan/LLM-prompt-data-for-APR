### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces when determining the current indentation level. This results in incorrect behavior when processing lines with different indentation levels, specifically when encountering comments after a dedent.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent in scenarios where tabs are used. This directly relates to the GitHub issue reported, where the expected behavior is not reflected after the reformatting process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug and ensure correct handling of indentation, particularly in the presence of tabs, the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly calculate the current column based on both spaces and tabs. This adjustment should enable the function to accurately process lines with varying indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles both spaces and tabs when calculating the current column, ensuring accurate processing of indentation levels in the input prefix.
