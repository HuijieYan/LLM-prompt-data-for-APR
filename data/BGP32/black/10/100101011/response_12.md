### Analysis
The buggy function, `_partially_consume_prefix`, is intended to process a prefix string in Python code based on indentation levels and specific characters. The bug appears to be related to correctly handling comments and indentation. The failing test function, `test_comment_indentation`, aims to test the behavior for various code snippets with comments and different levels of indentation.

Based on the provided runtime values and types, it is observable that the function fails to correctly handle indentation levels and comments after dedenting. The function should maintain consistent indentation levels for comments after dedents, which aligns with the GitHub issue explaining that incorrect indentation occurs specifically for comments after a dedent when using tabs.

### Bug Identification
The bug is likely in the `if wait_for_nl` block and how it handles the newline characters and column tracking after dedents. The incorrect handling of tabs and spaces during indentation calculations leads to improper comment alignment following dedents.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect behavior when handling comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs instead of spaces. The function fails to correctly track the indentation levels, leading to misaligned comments in the output.

### Fix Strategy
To address the bug, the function needs to accurately track the indentation levels and ensure that comments retain the correct alignment after dedents. Adjustments are needed in how the function handles tabs, spaces, and newlines to maintain consistent indentation throughout the prefix processing.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False

        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.isspace():
                lines.append(current_line)  # Handle newlines before processing comments
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with handling tabs, spaces, newlines, and comments after dedents to ensure proper alignment in the output. The function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue regarding incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
