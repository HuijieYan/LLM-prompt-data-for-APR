### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle consuming characters up to a specified column count, considering tabs and spaces. The issue seems to be related to how indentation for comments is handled, specifically after a dedent operation. The function incorrectly handles the case where a comment is encountered after dedent, resulting in incorrect indentation.

### Error Location:
The possible error location is within the block where a comment is handled:
```python
elif char == '\n':
    # unexpected empty line
    current_column = 0
```
This block seems to reset the column count to 0 unconditionally when encountering a newline character. This behavior is incorrect in the context of comments following dedented code blocks.

### Bug Cause:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered. This reset causes the indentation of the comment to be incorrect after a dedent operation.
2. The reset to `current_column` should only happen when reaching the end of the current line and starting a new one, not unconditionally on encountering a newline character.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is reset to 0 only when a new line starts (after a newline character only if it's not inside the comment block). This adjustment will prevent inappropriate indentation changes for comments following dedents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring that the `current_column` is reset to 0 only when starting a new line and not unconditionally on encountering newline characters, the corrected function should now handle indentation for comments correctly, especially after dedents.
