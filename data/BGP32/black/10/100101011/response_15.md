### Error Location:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to handling the wait_for_nl flag correctly. The logic to handle indentation levels and newline characters seems to be faulty, affecting the proper reconstruction of the prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the provided test function `test_comment_indentation`, the function `fs` is called with different input contents (contents_tab and contents_spc) to compare the formatted output. However, the function itself uses tabs for indentation.
2. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function fails to correctly handle indentation levels, especially when encountering newline characters after dedent.
3. The issue reported in GitHub also mentions the incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent, which aligns with the buggy function's problematic behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Properly handle the indentation levels and newline characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to accurately read and reconstruct the prefix string.
2. Ensure that the function handles tabulated contents consistently, preserving the original indentation format.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issues faced in the failing test cases and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue related to incorrect indentation when dealing with tabulated comments after dedent.
