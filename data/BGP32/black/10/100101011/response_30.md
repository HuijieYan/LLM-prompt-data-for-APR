### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where handling of indentation levels and line breaks might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The `wait_for_nl` condition is not properly handled, leading to incorrect indentations.
2. The logic to manage the current line and update columns is flawed, especially after a newline character.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the indentation levels based on the specified `column`.
2. Ensure that the current line is appropriately maintained and indented based on the input prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing these fixes, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and address the issue reported on GitHub.
