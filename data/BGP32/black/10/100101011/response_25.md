## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on specific indentation rules. However, it fails to handle tab characters (`'\t'`) correctly, especially when dealing with comments after dedents. This causes incorrect indentation changes, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Identified Bug:
The bug occurs in the condition check `elif char == '\n'` where the function resets `current_column` to `0`. This logic is incorrect when dealing with tab characters since tabs should contribute to the column count rather than resetting it.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tab characters (`'\t'`). We should increment `current_column` by the equivalent spaces contributed by each tab. Additionally, we need to ensure that comments after dedents maintain correct indentation.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            tab_spaces = 4  # Assuming each tab consists of 4 spaces
            current_column += tab_spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check if the comment follows a dedent
            if current_column < column and not current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                return ''.join(lines), current_line

            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the changes above, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle tab characters and ensure that comments after dedents maintain their proper indentation. This fix should address the reported GitHub issue regarding incorrect indentation changes in certain scenarios.
