### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the handling of indentation levels with tabs and spaces is incorrect. Specifically, when encountering a tab character `\t`, the function increments `current_column` by 4, which might not align with the actual indentation levels when mixing tabs and spaces.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect handling of tab characters leading to incorrect indentation levels in the output, as reported in the GitHub issue. The function fails to correctly calculate the column position, leading to inconsistent formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent handling of tab and space characters to calculate the actual indentation level.
2. Update the logic to correctly determine the indentation level when encountering tab characters.
3. Review the logic for handling newline characters to maintain correct formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the correct indentation based on tab widths
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle newline characters and reset column
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Indent is finished
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now correctly handle indentation with both tabs and spaces, resolving the bug identified in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
