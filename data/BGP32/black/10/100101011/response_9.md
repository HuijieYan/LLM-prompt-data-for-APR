### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function aims to handle prefix indentation in a given code snippet.
2. The bug seems related to indentation handling in the presence of tabs and spaces in the input code.
3. The failing test case highlights the specific scenario where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent operation.
4. Based on the runtime variable values, the issue arises when the function encounters a newline character '\n' leading to incorrect behavior.
5. The GitHub issue confirms the problem with incorrect comment indentation after dedenting when tabs are used.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the existing logic in the function not properly accounting for the scenarios where tabs are used for indentation in the input code. When transitioning between tabs and spaces for indentation, the function fails to align comments correctly, resulting in the observed failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle tabs and spaces consistently for calculating the correct column position during indentation. Proper checking and adjustment of the indentation level when encountering tabs or spaces, especially before comments, will resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After implementing the corrected version of the function, the bug related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation when using tabs should be resolved.
