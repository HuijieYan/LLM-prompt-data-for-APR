The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to the condition where a newline character (`\n`) is encountered. When a newline character is found, the `current_column` should be reset to 0, but the code mistakenly resets it only in the case when the character is not a space or tab. 

To fix this bug, we need to move the line `current_column = 0` to the correct place, i.e., when a newline character is encountered regardless of the character being a space, tab, or any other character.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset current_column when encountering a newline character
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that the `current_column` is correctly reset to 0 when a newline character is encountered, fixing the bug where the indent was not correctly handled in the original function. After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
