The cause of the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that it does not correctly handle the indentation levels in the input prefix. Specifically, it fails to track the cumulative column position when encountering tabs or spaces, resulting in incorrect indentation levels and failures to identify new lines.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the `current_column` is updated for tabs and spaces and correctly handle the case when encountering a new line character. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function properly tracks the accumulated lines and columns based on the input prefix.

Here is a corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1  # Update column for space
        elif char == '\t':
            # Update column for tab assuming 4 spaces per tab
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle newline character correctly
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)  # Add current line to lines
            current_line = ""  # Reset current line
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle the indentation levels, track columns accurately, and correctly process new line characters in the prefix input. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
