### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix of text based on the given column value.
2. The function iterates over each character in the prefix and tracks the current line and column.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the case where the next character after a space or tab is a newline character.
4. The bug leads to incorrect prefix consumption, resulting in failing tests related to comment indentation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character immediately after a space or tab. The current implementation incorrectly handles this scenario and fails to update the current line and column.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where a newline character follows a space or tab. Specifically, the current column should be updated to 0, and the wait_for_nl flag should be set to False in this case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Update current column to 0 and reset wait_for_nl
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the suggested changes, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle newline characters following spaces or tabs, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests related to comment indentation.
