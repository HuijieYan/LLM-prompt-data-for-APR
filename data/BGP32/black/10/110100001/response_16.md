## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on certain conditions.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line character.
3. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters an unexpected empty line ('\n') without waiting for it, causing incorrect handling of indentation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of new line characters and indentation.
5. We need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix while maintaining correct column positions.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when it encounters an unexpected empty line ('\n') without waiting for it. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation and results in incorrect prefix consumption.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling new line characters ('\n') in the function. By ensuring that the function waits for a newline character before consuming it and resetting the column position, we can fix the bug effectively.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to wait for a new line character ('\n') before consuming it and resetting the column position, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
