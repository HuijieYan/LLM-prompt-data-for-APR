## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string until a certain column is reached. The bug seems to be related to how whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines are handled.

## Error Location:
The issue lies within the handling of newline characters within the loop. The condition to reset the `current_column` when encountering a newline is causing the incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character while waiting for more characters to form a complete indentation. It incorrectly resets the `current_column` counter, leading to incorrect results.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how newline characters are handled within the loop. The `current_column` should only be reset to 0 in case of a newline when we are waiting for more characters to complete the indentation.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:  # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_column += 1

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment in the newline condition and handling the empty line case separately, the bug should be fixed.
