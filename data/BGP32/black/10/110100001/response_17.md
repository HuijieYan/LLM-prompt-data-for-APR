The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by the logic to check if the current line has exceeded the specified column while waiting for a newline character. This check is incorrect and leads to the function not properly handling the indentation levels in the prefix string.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for tracking the current column and correctly handle the indentation levels. One strategy to fix this is to appropriately update the `current_column` variable based on the encountered characters ('\t', ' ', '\n') and check if the current line's effective length exceeds the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column > column:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the indentation levels and correctly determine when to wait for a newline character. The updated logic ensures that the function processes the prefix string according to the specified column width.
