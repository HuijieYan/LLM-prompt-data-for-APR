## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string based on a given column value.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, current column, and whether to wait for a newline character before consuming the next line.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character in an unexpected location, leading to incorrect handling of indentation levels.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle newline characters and adjust the column count accordingly.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the newline handling in the provided buggy function, we can ensure that the indentation levels are correctly tracked and the prefix string is consumed partially based on the specified column value.
