### Analysis:
The `Driver` class contains a `_partially_consume_prefix` function that is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column number while handling newline characters, spaces, and tabs correctly. The function is expected to return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of newline characters and the calculation of the current column. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation and alignment of the prefix string based on spaces and tabs.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling newline characters to correctly update the current column.
2. Update the condition for checking the indentation level based on the specified column number.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        indent_level = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip():
                    if current_column < column:
                        return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                if current_column >= column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for handling newline characters and adjusting the condition for checking the column number, the corrected function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column number.
