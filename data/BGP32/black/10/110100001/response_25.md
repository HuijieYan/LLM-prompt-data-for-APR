The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a given prefix based on a column value. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation levels and new lines.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The logic for updating the `current_column` value when encountering a tab character may not be correct.
2. The condition for resetting `current_column` to 0 when encountering a new line might not be working as intended.
3. The condition for checking if a line is empty and if the column is less than a specified value needs to be verified.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the incorrect calculation of the current column when tab characters are encountered and the incorrect handling of new lines for resetting the column value.

To fix the bug, the logic for updating the `current_column` when encountering tab characters should be adjusted to increment by 4. Additionally, the logic for resetting the column value to 0 when encountering new lines should be reviewed and corrected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0  # Reset column value to 0 for new line
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the issues related to tab characters and new lines, allowing the function to properly consume the prefix based on the specified column.
