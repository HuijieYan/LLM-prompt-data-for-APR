After analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the potential error location seems to be in the logic related to handling the indentation levels when encountering spaces, tabs, and newlines. The bug is likely causing the incorrect output when consuming the prefix text based on column indentation.

The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) in the prefix. It fails to correctly handle the case where there is an unexpected newline. This leads to incorrect indentation tracking and causes the function to return an incorrect result.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to accurately handle cases where a newline character is encountered. We should reset the `current_line` and `current_column` values when a newline is found unexpectedly. Furthermore, we should properly handle the wait_for_nl flag to ensure correct checking of newlines for indentation levels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # reset values for unexpected newline
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # line break handling
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now correctly handle cases where unexpected newlines are encountered while consuming the prefix text based on column indentation levels. This should address the bug and ensure the function works as expected with the failing test provided.
