The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic error where it fails to correctly handle the indentation level calculation when encountering a newline character.

The issue arises when a newline character is encountered and the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True`, indicating that an indentation block has ended. However, the current implementation does not correctly reset the `current_column` counter back to 0 after encountering a newline character.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `current_column` is set to 0 when a newline character is encountered.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now be able to handle the indentation properly when encountering newline characters. This fix should address the failing test case related to comment indentation.
