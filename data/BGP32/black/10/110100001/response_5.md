The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a bug related to handling the indentation level before a comment. The function fails to correctly handle tabs and spaces when checking the column position before a comment. As a result, the test `test_comment_indentation` fails when comparing the formatted content.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to correctly calculate the column position considering both tabs and spaces.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment has been made to correctly handle the indentation level with both tabs and spaces when calculating the column position. Now, the function should correctly consume the prefix and return the expected result for the test `test_comment_indentation`.
