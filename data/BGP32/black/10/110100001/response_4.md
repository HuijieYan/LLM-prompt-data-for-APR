## Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on a specified column. It is used to handle prefixes containing indentation characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines. The function loops through the prefix character by character, updating the current line and column based on certain conditions, including spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

The test function `test_comment_indentation` is checking whether the function correctly handles the indentation in Python code. It provides two sets of input contents with different indentation styles (tabs and spaces) and expects the function to format them to a specific style.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when it encounters a newline character while in the mode of waiting for a newline (`wait_for_nl == True`). In this mode, the function is supposed to check if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column before adding the line to the result. However, the condition `current_line.strip()` is used incorrectly because it does not account for lines containing only whitespace characters.

If the current line only contains whitespace characters (e.g., spaces or tabs), `current_line.strip()` will return an empty string, causing the function to incorrectly add an empty line to the result. This behavior results in unexpected output where the indentation is not handled correctly.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for checking if the current line contains non-empty content. Instead of using `current_line.strip()`, we should use `current_line.strip() != ''` to correctly determine if the line contains non-whitespace characters.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() != '' and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation correctly and provide the expected output for the test function.
