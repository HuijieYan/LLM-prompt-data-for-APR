After analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it seems that the issue lies in the logic that handles the indentation level calculation. The function is designed to consume the prefix up to a certain column position, but it fails to handle tabs and spaces correctly, leading to incorrect indentation calculation.

The bug occurs when checking for tabs (`\t`) and spaces (`' '`) in the prefix. The function incorrectly increments the `current_column` without taking into account the actual tab width (should be 4 spaces). This causes incorrect calculation of the actual column position in the prefix.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling tabs (`\t`) to correctly calculate the column position based on the tab width of 4 spaces. We should also simplify the code to improve readability.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
            continue

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab calculation logic and simplifying the code, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test for the comment indentation.
