## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume part of a prefix string until a certain column is reached. However, there are a couple of issues in the implementation that are causing it to fail the test case. 
1. The function is not correctly handling the case where the comment line starts with whitespace before the '#' character.
2. The function is not correctly handling the case where the comment line does not end with a newline character.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function not properly recognizing the start of the comment line and not consuming the full comment line when there are leading spaces/tab characters.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to properly handle the start of the comment line and consume the full comment line, even if it doesn't end with a newline character.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # consume the rest of the line as a comment
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a condition to properly identify the start of a comment line and consume the rest of the line as a comment, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
