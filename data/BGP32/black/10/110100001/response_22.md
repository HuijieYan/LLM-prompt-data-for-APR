After analyzing the `partially_consume_prefix` function in the `Driver` class and the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the issue seems to be with how the function handles the indentation characters (tab and spaces) in the input string `prefix`.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a newline character `\n` while it is waiting for the next line to start. This causes it to incorrectly treat the next line as empty, resulting in incorrect indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `if char == '\n'` condition to properly handle cases where the current_line is not empty and update the current line accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The updated code now correctly handles newline characters, ensuring that the current line is not considered empty when encountering a newline while waiting for the next line. This should fix the indentation issue causing the failing test to pass.
