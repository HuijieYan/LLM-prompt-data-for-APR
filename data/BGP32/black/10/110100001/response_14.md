## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed part.
2. The potential error locations within the function include the handling of tabs and spaces for indentation tracking.
3. The bug is likely caused by incorrect tracking of column position when encountering tabs and spaces.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug would involve accurately updating the `current_column` based on the character encountered.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is 4 spaces
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                current_line = ""
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the `current_column` is updated correctly when encountering tabs and spaces, ensuring accurate tracking of the column position. This should address the bug and make the function work as intended.
