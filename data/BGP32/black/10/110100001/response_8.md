The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix of a given string up to a specific column index, taking into account spaces, tabs, and new lines. The bug occurs when encountering a new line character `'\n'` while `wait_for_nl` is not set, leading to the unexpected behavior of resetting the `current_column` to 0.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a new line character is encountered, the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly set to handle the indentation logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = True  # Initialize wait_for_nl to True
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True  # Set wait_for_nl to True when encountering new line character
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False  # Set wait_for_nl to False when encountering other characters
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `wait_for_nl` flag is appropriately handled, ensuring that the function iterates through the prefix of the string while correctly maintaining the indentation logic.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
