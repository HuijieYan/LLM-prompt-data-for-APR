The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how the `current_line` is handled and updated. It appears that after processing each character, the `current_line` is not being properly cleared/reset, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that `current_line` is reset correctly after each line is processed. One way to do this is to clear `current_line` whenever a new line character `\n` is encountered, indicating the end of the current line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    continue
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
                continue
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting `current_line` when encountering a newline character, we ensure that each line in the prefix is processed correctly. This correction should fix the bug and make the `_partially_consume_prefix` function work as intended.
