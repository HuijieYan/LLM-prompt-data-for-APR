## Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column index while handling indentation levels and newlines.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles newlines and indentation levels.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the formatting of code with tabs and spaces to check if the function formats them correctly.

## Bug:
- The bug is likely related to how the function handles indentation levels and newlines, causing incorrect formatting of the code.

## Strategy:
- Adjust the handling of newlines and indentation levels in the function to ensure proper formatting.
- Make sure that the function correctly consumes characters up to the specified column index.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Driver(object):

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):] 
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust column for tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle newline correctly
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting how tabs are handled and ensuring correct newline handling, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test `test_comment_indentation`.
