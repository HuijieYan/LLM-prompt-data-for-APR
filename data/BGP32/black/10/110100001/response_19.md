## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle the indentation of text based on a given prefix and column.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function identifies and handles newline characters.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the function correctly formats the indentation of code with comments in different scenarios.
4. The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line and fails to correctly handle the indentation.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the logic related to handling newline characters in the function.

## Correction:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # check if current_line is empty before resetting current_column
                if not current_line.strip():
                    current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a condition to check if the current line is empty before resetting the `current_column` when encountering a newline character, we address the bug related to unexpected empty lines. This correction ensures that the function handles the indentation as intended.
