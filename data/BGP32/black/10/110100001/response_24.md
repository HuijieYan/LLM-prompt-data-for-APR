### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix based on indentation.
2. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line based on certain conditions.
3. The bug in this function might be related to the way it handles new lines and indentation levels, resulting in incorrect consumption of the prefix.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly consumes the prefix based on indentation levels and new lines.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when it encounters a new line character (`'\n'`) while waiting for a new line. This leads to an unexpected empty line being created without resetting the `current_column` count. As a result, the function fails to accurately consume the prefix based on the specified column position.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to make sure that when a new line character is encountered while waiting for a new line, the `current_column` count is reset to 0. This will ensure that the function correctly handles new lines and indentation levels while consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # reset the current column count to 0 if a new line character is encountered
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` count to 0 whenever a new line character is encountered while waiting for a new line, the corrected version of the function should now accurately consume the prefix based on the specified column position and pass the failing test.
