The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a specific column value and returning the consumed portion along with the remaining portion. The issue seems to be with handling indentation and line breaks correctly.

The bug occurs when encountering a character that is not a space, tab, or newline while waiting for a newline. This results in the function returning prematurely without properly consuming the entire prefix according to the specified column value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all characters in the prefix string correctly, keeping track of line breaks and column positions accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if the line is not empty
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line = ""  # Reset current line for empty lines
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes a check to reset the current line when encountering an empty line (newline without any content). This change ensures that the function consumes the prefix string according to the specified column value.

After applying this correction, the updated function should pass the failing test provided.
