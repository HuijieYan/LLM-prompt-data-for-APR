### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that is buggy.
2. The `test_comment_indentation` test function checks the behavior of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function when dealing with different indentation styles.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the logic of handling indentation levels in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. It fails to correctly track and adjust the column position when encountering different types of characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). This leads to incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly update the column position and handle different types of whitespace characters causing the incorrect indentation processing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation levels by correctly updating the column position based on different characters encountered. It should also check for the actual indentation level instead of simply incrementing the column position for each whitespace character.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_column += len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version, the function now correctly handles different types of whitespace characters and adjusts the column position accordingly. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
