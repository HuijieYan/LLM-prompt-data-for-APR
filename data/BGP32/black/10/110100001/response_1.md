### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column.
2. The function seems to have issues with correctly handling indentation and newline characters.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the output of the function for different indentation styles and comment placements.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is due to incorrect logic in handling indentation levels and newline characters. This causes incorrect consumption of the prefix string, leading to failing tests when checking for correct formatting.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles indentation levels and consumes the prefix string up to the specified column.
2. Adjust the logic for handling different whitespace characters (' ', '\t') and newline characters ('\n').
3. Modify the function to accurately parse and consume the prefix string while respecting the column parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl and char != '\n':
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
            
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    remaining_prefix = prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                    return ''.join(lines), remaining_prefix
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
