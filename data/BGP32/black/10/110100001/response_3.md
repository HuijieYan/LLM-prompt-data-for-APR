**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a given prefix string up to a certain column limit. It appends character by character to `current_line` and checks for different conditions like spaces, tabs, and newlines to determine when to stop.
   
2. Potential error locations:
   - The condition `if char == '\n':` sets `current_column = 0` without considering the scenario where the newline character is not at the end of the line.
   - The logic for updating `current_column` based on spaces and tabs might be incorrect.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug causes incorrect calculation of the consumed prefix, resulting in incorrect output.
   - It specifically fails to handle cases where the newline character is not at the end of the line properly.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the logic to correctly handle newline characters and update the `current_column` based on the actual tab width.
   - Ensure that the consumed prefix is correctly tracked and returned.
   
5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        tab_width = 4  # Assuming tab width as 4 spaces

        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version attempts to address the issues mentioned above, specifically handling newline characters and updating the `current_column` correctly based on spaces and tabs.
