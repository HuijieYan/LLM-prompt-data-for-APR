The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on a specific column. The bug in the function causes it to overlook the identification of the current column position and incorrectly return the consumed prefix. This results in failing the test that checks the comment indentation.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect updating of the `current_column` variable within the `elif char == '\n':` block. When encountering a new line character, the function fails to reset the column count to 0, which leads to incorrect column counting.

To fix this bug, the `current_column` variable should be updated correctly whenever encountering a new line character. By setting `current_column = 0` in the corresponding block, the function will reset the column count for each new line.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column count for new line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After implementing this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the column count and consume the prefix based on the specified column, passing the failing test related to comment indentation.
