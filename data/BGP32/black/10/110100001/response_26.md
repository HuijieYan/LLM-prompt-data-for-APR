The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has an issue where it does not correctly handle the case when the current column is less than the specified column while waiting for a new line character. This causes incorrect behavior when calculating the consumed prefix.

The bug occurs because the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` is checking if the current line is not empty AND the current column is less than the specified column. This should actually be checking if the current column is greater than or equal to the specified column.

To fix this bug, you need to update the condition to `if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:` so that it properly handles the case when the current column is equal to or greater than the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this correction, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column, passing the failing test.
