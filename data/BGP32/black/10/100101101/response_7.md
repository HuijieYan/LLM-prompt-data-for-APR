### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the case where the indentation level exceeds the specified column value. This leads to incorrect behavior when a comment is encountered with a higher indentation level than the specified column.

### Bug Location:
The main cause of the bug lies in the condition where the function checks if the current column is less than the specified column. This condition should consider the total indentation level, including both spaces and tabs, rather than just the number of characters.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly calculate the total indentation level by considering both spaces and tabs. We should adjust the calculation of the indentation level when encountering spaces and tabs in the input string to accurately track the current column position.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            if wait_for_nl:
                current_column += 4
            else:
                current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly updating the current_column based on the indentation level, the function should now be able to accurately handle cases where the indentation exceeds the specified column value.
