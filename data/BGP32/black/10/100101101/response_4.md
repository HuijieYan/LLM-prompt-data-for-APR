### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the logic to handle newline characters is incorrect. When encountering a newline character, the function should check if the current line has any content before moving to the next line. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect line breaks and incorrect column counts.

In Case 1, the function incorrectly interprets the newline character, leading to premature line breaks. It should wait for a newline character only if the current line has content to be included in the final result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the logic related to handling newline characters. Ensure that the function correctly determines when a line break should occur based on the presence of content in the current line. Additionally, update the column count calculations to accurately reflect the indentations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # check if line has content before considering a line break
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle newline characters and maintain the indentation when generating the partial prefix.
