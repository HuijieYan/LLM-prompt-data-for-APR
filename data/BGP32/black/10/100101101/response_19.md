### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in how it handles checking indentation levels using tabs (`\t`) and spaces. The function incorrectly calculates the `current_column` when encountering tabs, leading to incorrect indentation level comparisons.

In case 1, the function fails to correctly identify the indentation level due to the incorrect handling of tabs. The function mistakenly calculates the `current_column` as 4 when encountering a tab instead of incrementing it by 4. This discrepancy leads to the function returning an incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles tabs and correctly calculates the `current_column` based on the number of spaces each tab represents (usually 4 spaces).

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for 4 spaces per tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By explicitly increasing `current_column` by 4 when encountering a tab, the corrected function will now handle tabs correctly and calculate the indentation levels accurately. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
