### Explanation of the Bug
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to the condition where `wait_for_nl` is set to `True` when a character other than newline (`'\n'`) is encountered. This causes premature marking of the end of the indent, resulting in incorrect behavior when processing comments and their indentation.

In the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments, leading to output discrepancies between the `contents_tab` and `contents_spc` strings. This failure arises from the incorrect handling of newline characters and the tracking of column positions during indentation processing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation calculation and newline character tracking. Specifically, we should adjust the logic for updating `wait_for_nl`, line concatenation, and column tracking to accurately reflect the intended behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the function appropriately handles the indentation tracking and newline character detection, ensuring that comments and associated indentation are processed correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.
