The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the indentation levels when consuming the prefix text. The function fails to correctly handle spaces and tabs when calculating the column position. This leads to incorrect indentations being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to tracking the current column position based on spaces and tabs.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version now correctly adjust the column position when encountering tabs to match the expected indentation level. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected for the given test cases.
