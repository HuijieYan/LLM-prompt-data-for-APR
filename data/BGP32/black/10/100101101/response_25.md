The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to how it handles whitespace characters and newlines when trying to partially consume a prefix string based on a specific column value.

1. Analysis:
   - The function iterates over the characters in the prefix string.
   - It maintains a current line, current column, a list of lines, and a flag `wait_for_nl` to track the state.
   - It aims to consume the prefix until the specified column value is reached, but it fails in some cases related to handling whitespace and newlines.

2. Potential error location:
   - The logic around detecting the end of indentation and consuming the prefix up to the specified column seems flawed.
   - Handling of different whitespace characters and newlines might be incorrect.

3. Bug Explanation:
   - The bug occurs because the function incorrectly detects when to consume the prefix based on indentation and newlines. This causes issues with correctly consuming the prefix up to the specified column value.

4. Fix Strategy:
   - Update the logic for handling newlines and whitespace characters to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column value.
   - Adjust the conditions for identifying the end of indentation and when to consume the prefix.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:  # Include equal sign for correct comparison
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjusting tab handling to increment by multiples of 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments mentioned in the corrected version of the function, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the prefix string consumption, and the failing test case related to comment indentation should pass successfully.
