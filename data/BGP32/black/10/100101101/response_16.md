### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing because it fails to correctly handle the case where the indentation level of the comment exceeds the given column parameter. This results in incorrect splitting of the prefix string, leading to the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the comment indentation level exceeds the specified column parameter. This can be achieved by modifying the logic to account for the indentation level of the comment when determining whether to split the prefix string.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By updating the logic to consider empty lines as well as ensuring the correct handling of various indentation levels, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
