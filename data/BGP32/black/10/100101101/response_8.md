### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from not correctly handling the indentation level between spaces and tabs. When encountering a new line character (`char == '\n'`), the function should reset the `current_column` to 0, which marks the start of a new line. However, the calculation of the column is not properly adjusted based on the indentation type (space or tab).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to ensure that the `current_column` is correctly calculated according to the indentation level of spaces and tabs. Adjust the logic to properly handle the indentation differences between tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust the tab size to 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column at new line
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By adjusting the column calculation for tabs to `current_column += 4`, we ensure that the logic incorporates both spaces and tabs correctly, aligning with the indentation level. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests given.
