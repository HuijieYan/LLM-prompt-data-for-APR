### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the input `prefix` contains a comment line that starts with space characters or tabs. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level of the comment line compared to the specified `column` argument.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` when checking for the necessary indentation level of the comment line. This condition does not correctly determine whether the comment is properly indented or not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to maintain the proper indentation level of the comment lines by comparing the required column to the actual indentation level of the comment line.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By comparing the length of the expanded tabs in the current line to the specified `column`, the function now correctly handles the comment line's indentation level. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
