### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters a newline character and attempts to handle indentation based on the current column. When a newline character is encountered, the function resets the current column to 0, which causes incorrect handling of indentation when resuming after the newline.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic handling the newline character correctly so that the current column is updated based on the indentation level of the previous line.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_indent = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                prev_indent = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Adjust current_column based on previous indent level
            current_column += prev_indent
            prev_indent = current_column
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function above, the bug in handling indentation after encountering a newline character should be fixed, and the function should now correctly handle the indentation level when resuming after a newline.
