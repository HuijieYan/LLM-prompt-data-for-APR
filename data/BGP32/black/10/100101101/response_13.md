The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic related to handling the indentation level. The function fails to correctly identify and remove the excess indentation before a comment on the same indentation level. 

The cause of the bug can be traced back to the 'elif char == '\n':' condition. This condition resets the current_column to 0 without properly accounting for the case where a comment follows, leading to incorrect behavior.

To address this issue, we need to adjust the logic within the function to properly handle comments on the same indentation level. We can achieve this by keeping track of the previous character processed and adjusting the behavior accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    prev_char = ''
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif prev_char == ' ' or prev_char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        prev_char = char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases by correctly handling comments and their indentation level.
