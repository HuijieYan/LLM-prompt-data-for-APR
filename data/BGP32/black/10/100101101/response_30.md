### Analysis
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle indentation in a text file by consuming leading whitespaces and tabs up to a certain column value. However, the implementation is incorrect due to failing to append the `current_line` to `lines` when encountering a newline character. This causes the function to not return the correct result.

### Potential Error Location
The bug is identified in the section where the function checks for a newline character but fails to append the `current_line` to `lines`.

### Bug Explanation
In Case 1, the input prefix should be partially consumed up to the specified column value of 8. However, the current implementation fails to properly process newlines and does not handle appending `current_line` to `lines` correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, the `current_line` is appended to `lines` before resetting the counters and variables. This adjustment will enable the correct handling of newlines and indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment to correctly handle the newline character, the function should now properly consume the prefix up to the specified column value. This correction aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases.
