### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the case where a newline character (`\n`) is encountered while waiting for a newline. This bug leads to incorrect indentations and behavior when consuming characters in the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle the situation when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline. We should reset the `current_column` to 0 and continue processing the prefix string following the newline character.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0  # Reset current_column if not a newline
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the fix, the corrected function should now handle the newline characters correctly and pass the failing test cases.
