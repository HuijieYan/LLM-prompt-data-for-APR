### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) in the prefix string. The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when it should only do so if the line is empty. This incorrect behavior leads to incorrect handling of the indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to handling newline characters in the prefix string. Specifically, we should only reset the `current_column` to 0 if the current line is empty after removing leading and trailing whitespaces. This adjustment will ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation and avoids incorrectly resetting the `current_column`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' and current_line.strip():  # Check if line is not empty
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # Check if line is not empty
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustments as described in the corrected function, the bug related to incorrect handling of newline characters in the prefix string should be resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
