### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrectly handling the condition when the function encounters a new line character, '\n'. In the current implementation, when a new line character is encountered, the function is not correctly resetting the current column count and processing the lines. This leads to incorrect prefix consumption and incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a new line character, the function resets the current column count and processes the lines correctly. This involves updating the logic around handling new line characters and properly updating the state variables like `current_column` and `lines`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function above addresses the issues with handling new line characters and properly updating the state variables. This version should pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
