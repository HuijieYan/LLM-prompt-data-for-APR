The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of column counting when encountering tab characters. The function fails to properly adjust the `current_column` variable based on the tab character's position.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the function to correctly calculate the column position when encountering tab characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function adjusts the `current_column` value properly when encountering tab characters, ensuring that the column position is calculated accurately.

Executing the failing test with this corrected function should now pass successfully.
