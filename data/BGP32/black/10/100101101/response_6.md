The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of newline characters and indentation levels. In the failing test cases provided, the function fails to correctly consume and format the input prefix according to the specified column value, resulting in incorrect outputs.

The main issue lies in the logic for tracking column positions and handling newline characters. The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character without checking the indentation level. This leads to incorrect calculations and output in cases where there are multiple levels of indentation.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly track the column position based on indentation. Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the column position is correctly updated based on spaces and tabs, and handles newline characters considering the indentation level before resetting the column position.

By applying this fix, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected outputs.
