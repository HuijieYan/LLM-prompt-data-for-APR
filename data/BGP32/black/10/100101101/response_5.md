### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition that checks for an empty line (`'\n'`). When an empty line is encountered, the current column count is reset to 0, which is incorrect. This behavior causes the function to miscount the indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition handling the '\n' character to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag instead of resetting the `current_column` count to 0. This change will ensure that the indentation level is correctly maintained.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and pass the failing test cases.
