### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when there is a comment following an indent that does not align with the expected column value. The function incorrectly handles this scenario and fails to properly return the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises from the logic where the function sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` when an indent is finished. However, in the case of a comment following the indent that does not align with the expected column value, the function incorrectly waits for a newline character before checking if the current indentation is correct, leading to an incorrect extraction of consumed prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the loop to properly handle the case of a comment following an indent that does not align with the expected column value. We need to check the column alignment immediately after encountering a non-whitespace character and handle the extraction of consumed prefix accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_line += char
    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

By making the adjustments as shown in the corrected version of the function, the issue related to comments following indents with incorrect column alignment should be resolved.
