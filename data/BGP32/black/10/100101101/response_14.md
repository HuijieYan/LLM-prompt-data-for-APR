### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` has a logic issue in handling the indentation levels when consuming the prefix string. It fails to account for the correct indentation level when encountering whitespace characters like spaces and tabs. This results in incorrect prefix consumption, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of how indentation levels are tracked and consumed. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value accurately reflects the effective column position, considering both spaces and tabs properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width is 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This correction ensures that the current line's indentation level is properly tracked and consumed, allowing the function to correctly process the prefix string based on the given column parameter.

By using this corrected function, the failing test cases should now pass as the function accurately consumes the prefix string according to the specified indentation levels.
