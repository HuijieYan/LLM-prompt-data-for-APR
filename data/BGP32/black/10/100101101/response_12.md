### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrectly handling the indentation levels when consuming the prefix. The function fails to correctly calculate the column value when encountering tabs, leading to misalignment of the comments in the output.

In the failing test scenario where a comment is prefixed by tabs, the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` value when encountering a tab character. This incorrect update causes the function to misalign the comment leading to test failures.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function calculates the `current_column` value when encountering tab characters. Since tabs represent four spaces, we should increment the `current_column` by 4 when a tab is encountered.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab character
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and comments, passing the failing tests and returning the expected output values.
