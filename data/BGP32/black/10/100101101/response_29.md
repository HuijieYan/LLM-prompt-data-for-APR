### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the case correctly where there is a comment after an indented block. The function is not resetting the `current_column` counter correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when encountering newlines. This causes an issue when trying to consume the correct prefix based on the column value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling newlines to properly reset the `current_column` counter when encountering them. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct prefix is consumed based on the given `column` value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    if current_line.strip():
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    else:
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making these adjustments to handle the newline characters and the column values correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
