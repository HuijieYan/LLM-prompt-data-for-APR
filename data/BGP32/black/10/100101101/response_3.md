### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is that when encountering a newline character `\n`, the current_column is not being reset to 0. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation level when the function encounters a new line.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that whenever a newline character is encountered, the `current_column` is reset to 0. This will allow the function to correctly track the column position and handle the indentation level properly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                continue
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```  

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is reset to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered, fixing the bug in handling indentation levels.
