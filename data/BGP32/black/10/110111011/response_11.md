### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the incorrect handling of indentation levels for comments in the given code snippet. The function fails to preserve the correct indentation of comments after a dedent operation, leading to discrepancies in the formatted output. 

The main issue arises when the code encounters a comment line after reducing the indentation level. The function mistakenly sets `wait_for_nl` to `True` signaling the need to wait for a new line to begin a new indentation level, which isn't the intended behavior. Consequently, this leads to incorrect indentation for comments after dedenting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, the function must correctly identify when to determine the next indentation level instead of forcing a new line. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic to handle comments more effectively when encountering a different indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Reset current column
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # No need to wait for new line if encountering other characters
                wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the function to reset the `wait_for_nl` flag appropriately and making sure comments are handled correctly after a dedent operation, the corrected version of the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases.
