### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relation:**
   - The `partially_consume_prefix` function from the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on indentation rules.
   - The buggy behavior seems to affect the correct handling of indentation levels when encountering comments.

2. **Error Location:**
   - The bug is likely related to how the function handles the wait_for_nl flag and the indentation level (current_column).

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The failing tests highlight discrepancies in comment indentation compared to the expected result.
   - The bug arises when the function encounters comments after dedent operations, resulting in incorrect handling of comment indentation levels.
   - The bug is evident from the difference in comment indentation presented in the failing tests and the expected output.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - To address the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the indentation levels of comments after a dedent operation.
   - Ensure that comments are indented according to the surrounding code's level based on the established indentation rules.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip().startswith("#"):  # Adjust comment indentation
                    lines.append(current_line)  # Preserve comment indentation
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the fixed version:
- Added a check when encountering a newline character to adjust comment indentation by preserving the comment's current line.
- This adjustment ensures that comments after dedents are correctly indented based on the surrounding code and follows established rules for comment alignment.
