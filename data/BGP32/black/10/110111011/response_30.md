### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not handle tab characters correctly when calculating the column positions in the input prefix. When encountering a tab character (`\t`), the function incorrectly adds 4 to the `current_column`, but in reality, a tab character should advance the column position to the next multiple of 4. This discrepancy leads to incorrect column calculations especially when dealing with mixed indentation styles (spaces and tabs).

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the handling of tab characters (`\t`) so that the column position is updated correctly. Instead of adding a fixed value of 4, calculate the additional amount needed to reach the next multiple of 4 columns and update `current_column` accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Calculate the additional number of spaces needed to reach the next multiple of 4 columns
            spaces_to_next_tab = 4 - (current_column % 4)
            current_column += spaces_to_next_tab
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correct handling of tab characters as described above, the corrected function should now produce the expected column positions even with mixed indentation styles, resolving the issue observed in the failing test case and the reported GitHub issue.
