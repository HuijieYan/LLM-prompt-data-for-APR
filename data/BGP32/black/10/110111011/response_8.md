### Explanation of the Bug

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function where the indentations for comments are not handled correctly. This causes incorrect behavior when dealing with comments after dedents in the code.

1. In Case 1, the function fails to correctly handle the indentation for the comment line, resulting in an incorrect output.
2. In Case 3, the function fails to correctly adjust the current column when encountering a `'#'` character for a comment line.
3. These issues lead to incorrect handling of comments after dedents, as observed from the failing test in the test file.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of handling comments and their indentation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the comment lines are correctly aligned based on the existing indentations when encountering them.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                # Correcting indentation for comments
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    current_line = ' ' * current_column + current_line.lstrip()
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Result

With the corrected version of the function, the code should now correctly handle the indentation for comments after dedents, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
