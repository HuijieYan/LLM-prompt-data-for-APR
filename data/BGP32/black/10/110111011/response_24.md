### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation. It seems to incorrectly handle waiting for a newline after tab characters or spaces.
2. The function attempts to split lines based on indentation but fails to properly handle indentation levels and newline characters.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks whether comments maintain their indentation after dedents, but due to incorrect handling of newline characters, it fails in cases where tabs are involved.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify indentation levels based on tabs, spaces, and newline characters while maintaining the comment positions.
5. Let's correct the function to address the issues identified.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4  # Adjust for multiple tabs
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle indentation levels with spaces, tabs, and newline characters. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test `test_comment_indentation` to pass.
