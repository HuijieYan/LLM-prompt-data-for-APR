### Error Analysis:
The issue seems to arise when handling comments that come after an indentation change in the input code. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` attempts to manage indentation levels but fails in scenarios involving comments.

The main causes of the bug seem to be:
1. Incorrect handling of lines when encountering a comment after an indentation change.
2. The logic for tracking the current column and lines being accumulated is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, the function needs to accurately handle the indentation level adjustments caused by comments. We should ensure that comments are aligned correctly with the existing code structure, especially after indentations changes.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
                    current_line += char
        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            lines.append(current_line)
        final_lines = ''.join(lines)
        return final_lines, prefix[len(final_lines):]
```

By modifying the logic to correctly handle comments after indent changes, the corrected function should be able to pass the failing test provided.
