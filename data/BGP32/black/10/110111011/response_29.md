### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to handle the consumption of the prefix string until a certain column depth is reached. The issue arises when dealing with different types of indentation characters like spaces and tabs. The function fails to maintain consistent indentation for comments after a dedent operation due to incorrect handling of newline characters and column tracking.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of newline characters when checking for indentation levels and resetting the column count.
2. Inadequate tracking of the current column depth, especially with tab characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the transition between different types of indentation characters (spaces and tabs) when process prefixes containing comments. This results in incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation, as observed in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Maintain consistent handling of newline characters to reset the column count appropriately.
2. Adjust the column count tracking to factor in the correct spacing corresponding to each indentation character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjusted for tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line += char  # Append newline to current_line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating how newline characters are handled and adjusting the column advances based on tab spacing, the corrected version of the function should successfully address the indentation inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub bug.
