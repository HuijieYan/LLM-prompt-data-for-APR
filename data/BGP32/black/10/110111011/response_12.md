### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to handle the partial consumption of a prefix string based on indentation level, so comments do not get improperly indented.
2. The function fails to correctly handle indentation levels when encountering comments after a dedent, leading to incorrect output.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` demonstrates how the function incorrectly modifies comment indentation.
4. The error occurs due to the logic in the function not properly tracking and handling indentation levels with comments.
5. To fix the bug, the function logic needs adjustment to correctly manage indentation levels and handle comments after a dedent.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly track and apply the correct indentation levels when processing comments following a dedent. As a result, the comment indentation is incorrectly altered, leading to failed tests and inconsistency in code formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle indentation for comments, especially after a dedent.
2. Implement a mechanism to maintain the correct indentation level for comments based on the code structure.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # Check if the line contains a comment
            if '#' in current_line:
                # Find the index of the comment
                comment_idx = current_line.index('#')
                # Adjust the column based on the comment position
                current_column = max(current_column, comment_idx)
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to adjust the `current_column` based on the comment position within a line, the corrected version should now maintain the correct indentation levels for comments, effectively resolving the issue.
