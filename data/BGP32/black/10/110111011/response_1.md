### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to process a given prefix based on a specific column value. The bug seems to occur in the logic related to indentations and handling of newline characters.

1. In cases where there are tab characters, the current column calculation might be incorrect due to the expected behavior of tab characters increasing the column by 4.
2. Incorrect handling of when to reset `current_line` and `current_column`.
3. The condition for checking if `char` is a space or tab could lead to incorrect column increments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of tab characters, the conditions for resetting line and column values, and the logic for updating the current line text.

In some cases, the incorrect increment of the current column based on tab characters leads to offset indentations, causing the assertion failures in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic to correctly handle tab characters for column increments, ensuring the correct indentation levels.
2. Revise the conditions for resetting `current_line` and `current_column` to match the intended behavior.
3. Ensure that the `current_line` is properly updated considering all scenarios of character processing.
4. Validate the condition checks for space and tab characters to avoid unexpected column increments.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After correcting the logic as mentioned above, the function should handle the indentations correctly for different scenarios, resolving the issue raised in the failing test cases and GitHub.
