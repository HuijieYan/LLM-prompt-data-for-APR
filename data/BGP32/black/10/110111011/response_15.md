### Bug Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle the indentation levels of code snippets. The bug stems from the way it handles waiting for a new line after encountering indentation. The implementation fails to correctly determine the start of a new line when encountering an indentation level greater than the current one.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function fails to account for the fact that when encountering `'\n'`, the column should reset to 0 and a new line should start. However, the code does not reset `current_line` and `current_column` properly, causing incorrect behavior.

2. In Case 2, when the prefix is empty, the function fails to differentiate between the start of a new line with the correct indentation and the end of the input.

3. In Case 3, the implementation incorrectly appends `'\t'` to the `current_line` even though it should start a new line due to the presence of `'\n'`.

4. In Case 4, the function does not handle restarting a new line properly with the correct column value.

5. In Case 5, the function fails to handle the correct indentation when traversing through spaces.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to correctly handle starting a new line when necessary and to update the column and line appropriately for each character encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        for char in prefix:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                # Start a new line with appropriate indentation
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # Add character to the current line
                current_line += char
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic to handle a new line correctly when encountering `'\n'`, this corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the indentation in the provided test cases and resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
