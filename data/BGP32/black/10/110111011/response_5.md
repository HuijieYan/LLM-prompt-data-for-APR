### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the case where there are spaces or tabs after a multi-line comment. The issue arises when the comment is not aligned with the same level of indentation as the code. The function fails to correctly adjust the indentation level of the comment after a dedent, leading to incorrect formatting.

The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline in the middle of a line, instead of preserving the current indentation level. This causes a misalignment between the code and the comment indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent. The `current_column` should keep track of the correct indentation level, and the function should ensure that the comment aligns with the code at the right depth.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip():
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                
                # Reset current_line and wait_for_nl for processing next line
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
    
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent should be resolved.

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing test case to verify that the bug has been fixed.
