### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix based on indentation rules. The function attempts to handle various cases including handling tabs, spaces, newlines, and indentation levels.

### Error Location:
The issue lies within how the function handles the wait_for_nl condition, which should be set to True when encountering indentation until reaching a newline character.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the indentation after a dedent operation, leading to misplaced comments in the re-formatted output. This deviation from expected behavior results in failing tests due to incorrect handling of indentation levels.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation levels and newline characters needs to be adjusted to correctly preserve the relative positioning of comments. By ensuring that the wait_for_nl flag is set/reset appropriately and updating the handling of characters like tabs and spaces, we can address the incorrect behavior exhibited by the function.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # assuming tab width is 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():  # skip unexpected empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle newline characters correctly and reset indentation levels when encountering them, we can ensure that the function preserves the relative positioning of comments after dedent operations. This corrected version should address the bug and allow the failing tests to pass successfully.
