### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming a prefix text until a certain column value.
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters a '\n' character and tries to handle the indentation correctly but fails to maintain the correct column value for subsequent lines.
3. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` checks for the correct indentation of comments after dedenting, which fails due to incorrect handling of column values in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the column value is correctly updated when encountering newline characters or when waiting for a new line.
5. By correcting the column tracking logic, we can resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after dedenting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the column value correctly when encountering newline characters or waiting for a new line.
2. Ensure that the column value reflects the correct indentation level based on spaces and tabs.
3. Adjust the condition checks to handle indentation changes effectively.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the above corrections in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the bug related to incorrect indentation after dedenting should be fixed. This correction aligns with the expected behavior of maintaining proper column values and handling newline characters effectively.
