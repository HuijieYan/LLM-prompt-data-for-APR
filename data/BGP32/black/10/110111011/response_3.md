### Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to handle indentation levels up to the specified `column` limitation.
- The bug seems to occur when handling the scenario where a comment follows an indented block.
- The issue on GitHub also confirms that the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent is changing incorrectly.
- The failing test aims to ensure that comments after a dedent have consistent indentation with the subsequent code lines.
- Cases like Case 1 and Case 3 showcase the problem where comments are not aligned correctly after an indented block.
- The logic to handle post-dedent comment indentation seems to be failing in the current implementation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from the logic designed to handle the case where comments are positioned after an indented block. The function is not correctly aligning these comments with the subsequent code lines.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle the scenario where comments are located after an indented block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # handling empty lines
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # handling comments after dedent
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes additional handling for empty lines and adjusts the condition to properly handle comments after a dedent. This update should resolve the incorrect alignment of comments post-dedent, addressing the bug reported on GitHub.
