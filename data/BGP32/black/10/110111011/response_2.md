### Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process the prefix string character by character considering indentation levels. The issue arises when a comment line is encountered after dedentation where the comment needs to match the indent level of the next line of code. However, due to how the function is implemented, the comment indentation is not adjusted correctly.

The bug occurs because the function sets `wait_for_nl` to True when it detects a non-space/tab character, indicating the current line's indent is finished and it should wait for the next newline character. Then, after waiting for the newline character, the function incorrectly checks if the indent level is less than the desired column level before adjusting the comment's indent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the comment's indentation after dedentation needs to be modified. Instead of waiting for the newline character, the function should properly adjust the comment's indent based on the expected column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the placement of the comment indentation adjustment logic, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation of comments after dedentation.
