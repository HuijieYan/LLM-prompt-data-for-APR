### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of the prefix string until a certain column is reached, while respecting indentation levels for spaces and tabs.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks whether comments within the given code snippets maintain the expected indentation after reformatting.
- The error occurs when the indentation level of comments changes incorrectly after a dedent operation.
- The error message indicates a mismatch due to incorrect comment indentation: the result does not match the expected format.
- The runtime analysis displays discrepancies in the output values when the function returns after processing the input parameters.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the logic around handling indentation in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, the issue is related to the way it handles waiting for a new line after encountering non-space/tab characters.

When waiting for a new line after encountering any non-space/tab character, the function should accumulate spaces and tabs until a newline is reached, preventing this accumulated indentation from being consumed too early.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to handling the waiting for a new line process. By correctly accumulating the indentation levels before reaching a newline, we can ensure that the comments maintain their correct indentation level after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_count = 0

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char == '\n':
            indent_count = current_column  # Store the total indentation
            current_line += char
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            continue
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if indent_count < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_line += ' ' * indent_count  # Add correct prior indentation
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by ensuring that the correct indentation level is maintained for comments after dedent operations.
