### Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume characters from the `prefix` string until a certain column position is reached or certain conditions are met. It seems like the function is not correctly handling the indentation and newline characters when consuming the prefix.
2. The error occurs when dealing with the newline character during indentation checking causing the actual output to differ from the expected output in the failing test.
3. In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the input contains specific indentation and comment structures that trigger the bug in `_partially_consume_prefix`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure accurate handling of the newline character within the function to correctly maintain the indentation levels for comments.
5. The corrected version of the function should handle indentation and newline characters properly to align comments correctly.


### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    continue
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the logic responsible for how the function handles newline, tab, and space characters, the function now correctly consumes the prefix according to the specified column constraint. This corrected version should now align the comments appropriately and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
