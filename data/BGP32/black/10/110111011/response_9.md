### Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function
1. The condition `current_column < column` is not being correctly evaluated to maintain the correct indentation level.
2. The logic related to handling tabs and spaces for calculating the column might be incorrect.
3. The handling of waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) might not be functioning as intended.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes incorrect handling of indentation for comments after dedents, especially when the input contains a mix of tabs and spaces. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly handle the indentation level for comments, leading to incorrect output. This results in the failing test case for comment indentation.

The failing test demonstrates that the comment's indentation is inconsistent compared to the expected output. This discrepancy occurs due to the flawed logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in determining the indentation level while processing different types of characters.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the logic related to updating the `current_column` and `current_line` variables to accurately track the indentation level.
2. Ensure proper handling for tabs, spaces, and new lines to maintain correct behavior while processing the input prefix.
3. Verify the conditions for updating `current_line` and `lines` to store the correct information for indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Adjust based on desired tab size
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version of the function includes adjustments to handle the different types of characters in the prefix correctly. By accurately updating the `current_column` and `current_line` based on tabs, spaces, and new lines, the function should now process the prefix as intended and resolve the indentation issue.
