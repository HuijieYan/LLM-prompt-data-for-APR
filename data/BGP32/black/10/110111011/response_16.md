### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to handle indentation and line formatting in code. The main issue arises when dealing with comments and their indentation levels. The function currently fails to correctly adjust the indentation level for comments when there are tabs involved.

In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, we can see that the expected output is not matching the actual output due to incorrect indentation of comments. This leads to an `AssertionError` showing the mismatch between the two.

The test provides cases with varying inputs, both with spaces and tabs, to demonstrate the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of tab characters in adjusting column positions and waiting for new lines while processing the input prefix. This leads to incorrect identification of indentation levels, especially when dealing with comments after dedents.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function tracks the column positions corresponding to tab characters and update the logic for waiting for new lines when handling various types of characters (space, tab, newline). Additionally, we need to ensure that the comments are correctly indented based on the column positions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                indent_level = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            indent_level += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            indent_level += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            indent_level = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_column += indent_level

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, we have added an `indent_level` variable to correctly track the tab indentation. We update the `current_column` based on the `indent_level` for tabs and handle newline characters and the end of indentation blocks more effectively. This should address the bug and ensure correct handling of comment indentation after dedents.
