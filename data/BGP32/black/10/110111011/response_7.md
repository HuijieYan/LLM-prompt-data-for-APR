## Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix string until a certain column limit is reached based on spaces and tabs. If the indentation level changes, it should handle them as well.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation levels and newlines when encountering comments.
3. The failing test case is failing due to incorrect handling of comments in the presence of indentation changes.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are indented correctly based on the actual indentation level of the code.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to align them properly with the code's current indentation level. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                    # Handle comments by aligning them with the actual code indentation
                    lines.append(current_line.lstrip())
                    current_line = ""
                    wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this modification, comments will now be correctly aligned based on the actual code indentation without disrupting the formatting.

This should resolve the bug and make the failing test case pass.
