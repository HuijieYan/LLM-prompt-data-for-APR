### Analysis:
- The `Driver` class has a function `_partially_consume_prefix` that is designed to partially consume the given prefix text based on indentation.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is comparing the formatting of code with spaces and tabs, highlighting an issue with comment indentation specifically.
- The error message points out a mismatch in the formatting of comments between the expected and actual outputs.
- Based on the provided runtime values, the function is not handling newline characters and indentation correctly.
- The GitHub issue mentions a specific scenario where comment indentation is incorrect after a dedent, which aligns with the observed issue in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from incorrect handling of newline characters and indentation levels. When encountering a newline character, the function fails to adjust the column properly, leading to incorrect comment indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly tracks the column position after encountering different types of characters.
2. Properly handle newline characters to reset the column count.
3. Adjust the logic related to waiting for a newline to ensure correct handling of subsequent lines.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected version, the function now properly handles newline characters, adjusts the column count, and ensures correct comment indentation after dedents. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
