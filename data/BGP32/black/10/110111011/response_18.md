### Analysis:
- The `Driver` class contains a function `_partially_consume_prefix` that is responsible for processing a prefix string based on certain rules.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` indicates an issue with the indentation of comments after dedent operations.
- The provided error message highlights a mismatch due to incorrect comment indentation.
- The bug in the function is related to processing whitespace characters and handling line breaks while consuming the prefix string.

### Bug Cause:
- The function fails to properly handle the indentation of comments after the dedent operation.
- When encountering a newline character `\n`, it resets the current column count to `0` but does not account for the correct indentation level of the current line.
- This results in incorrect handling of comment indentation after dedents, leading to mismatch errors during comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic when encountering `\n` to consider the overall indentation level of the previous line.
2. Adjust the column count calculation to accurately capture the indentation level after dedents.
3. Ensure correct handling of whitespace characters for consistent indentation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        prev_line_indent = 0  # Track the previous line's indentation level
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and prev_line_indent < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                    prev_line_indent = current_column  # Update the previous line's indent
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to consider the previous line's indentation level after a newline, the corrected function should now handle comment indentations correctly and pass the failing test.
