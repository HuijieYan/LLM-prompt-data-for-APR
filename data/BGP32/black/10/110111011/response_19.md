### Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is causing incorrect behavior when handling indentation levels, especially in scenarios involving tab characters. The issue arises when waiting for a new line (`wait_for_nl`) after encountering indentation characters (space or tab). If there is a comment line (`#`) following the indentation but before the newline, the function incorrectly considers it as part of the indentation, leading to incorrect output format.

The bug is triggered by test cases where comments are at specific indentation levels. The failing test, `test_comment_indentation`, highlights this issue by comparing the expected format with the actual format generated by the function. The error message shows discrepancies in comment indentation among other lines, pinpointing the incorrect behavior of the function.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to distinguish between actual code indentation and comments. Comment lines should not contribute to the calculation of current column position. Since comments are not code and should not affect indentation tracking, a modification in the way comments are handled is necessary.

One possible strategy to address this issue is to introduce a separate check specifically for comments. When encountering a comment (lines starting with `#`), the function should handle them differently, ensuring that they do not influence column tracking. By excluding comments from indentation calculations, the function can accurately preserve the original indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorporating the suggested fix:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            # Skip comments
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function adds a specific check for comment lines, ensuring they do not affect indentation tracking. By skipping comments in the column calculation, the function will accurately handle indentation levels, resolving the bug observed in the failing test.
