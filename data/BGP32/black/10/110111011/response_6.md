### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` processes the input `prefix` character by character until certain conditions are met.
- The function fails to correctly handle the scenario of processing comments after dedentations with tab characters.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` compares the expected and actual output of code formatting, revealing the bug.
- The error message indicates a mismatch in the comment indentation due to incorrect processing.
- The runtime values indicate discrepancies in processing `\t` characters leading to incorrect column tracking.
- The GitHub issue further highlights the specific scenario causing the bug related to tabulated comments after dedentations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because the function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments after a dedent when encountering tab characters (`\t`).
- The function fails to adjust the column tracking correctly, leading to incorrect output formatting.
- This causes the failing test to identify the inconsistency in comment indentation, as the comment is not aligned properly after dedentation with tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic inside the function to accurately track the column position after encountering tab characters (`\t`).
- Ensure that the correct conditions are used to handle the indentation for comments after dedentations with tabs.
- Adjust the processing to correctly handle tab characters and maintain proper indentation alignment.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By integrating this corrected version of the function, the issue with comment indentation after dedentation with tab characters should be resolved.
