### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**: The `_partially_consume_prefix` function inside the `Driver` class is designed to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value. The function logic seems faulty when it encounters newlines.
   
2. **Error Locations**:
   - The incorrect handling of newlines seems to be causing the issue. The indenting behavior is not consistent after encountering a newline.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The function fails to handle indentation correctly after encountering newlines. This inconsistency causes the differing outputs in the failing test cases provided. The variables storing the lines and columns are not updated correctly leading to incorrect behavior.
   - The failing test shows that expected and actual outputs are not matching due to the incorrect indentation of comments.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Adjust the logic after encountering newlines to ensure the correct handling of indentation.
   - Update the maintenance of line and column values correctly within the loop.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    while current_column < column:
                        current_line += ' '
                        current_column += 1

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                while current_column < column:
                    current_line += ' '
                    current_column += 1
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        while current_column < column:
            current_line += ' '
            current_column += 1
            
        lines.append(current_line)
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected function above, the logic has been adjusted to handle correct indentation after encountering newline characters. This should align with the expected behavior in the failing test cases.
