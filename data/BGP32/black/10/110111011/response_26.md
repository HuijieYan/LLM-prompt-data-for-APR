### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method where it incorrectly handles the indentation level for comments after dedents in prefix lines. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments as observed in the failing tests. The function fails to maintain the correct column position for comments after dedents when consuming the prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to accurately track the column position while consuming the prefix string and handle the correct indentation level for comments. By ensuring that the column position is correctly updated when encountering comments after dedents, we can rectify the indentation issue identified in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the calculation for the column position when encountering a tab (`\t`) to properly increment the column position based on the indentation level in the prefix.
2. Updated the calculation for the tabulation to ensure it aligns with the correct column position, especially after dedent operations.

By making these adjustments, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and column positions for comments, resolving the issue observed in the failing tests.
