### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to handle prefix indentation correctly. However, based on the failing test and runtime values, it fails to maintain the indentation level for comments. The function's logic for tracking the column is flawed and leads to incorrect behavior when encountering tabulation and comments.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect tracking of the `current_column` when processing different types of characters. In the cases provided, the function fails when encountering comments after dedentations with tabs. It does not handle the correct calculation of the column position in such scenarios, leading to the indentation issue highlighted in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly accounts for the indentation level when encountering different characters, especially comments after dedentations with tabs. Adjusting the column calculations to accurately reflect the tab ('\\t') increments and ensuring the correct handling of comments in the wait state will address the issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)  # Adjust for remaining calculated column
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the adjustment in the `elif char == '\t'` block and considering the remaining column after the tab calculation, this corrected version should handle the indentation correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue related to incorrect comment indentation.
