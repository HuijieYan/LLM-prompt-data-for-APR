### Analyzing the Bug
1. **Buggy Function & Class Relationship:**
   - The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class.
   - It aims to consume part of a prefix string based on a given column value.

2. **Error Location:**
   - The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation in the `prefix` string.

3. **Bug Cause:**
   - The function fails to properly handle indentation for comments after dedents, as reported in the GitHub issue.
   - It incorrectly consumes the prefix characters leading to the incorrect indentation of comments.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
   - Modify how the prefix characters are consumed and processed to ensure correct indentation for comments.
   - Adjust the logic related to tracking spaces and tabs to preserve the original structure.

### Corrected Version
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected function modifies the logic regarding character consumption and newline handling to address the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub bug report. This revised version should handle the indentation of comments properly after dedent operations.
