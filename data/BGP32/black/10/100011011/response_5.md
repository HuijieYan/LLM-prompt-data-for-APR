### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix string up to a certain column value. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indentations and newlines within the prefix. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically tests the behavior of comments and indentation, highlighting a discrepancy in the output compared to the expected value.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The logic related to handling comments and determining columns might be incorrect.
2. Conditions within for the loop handling different characters could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The logic around `wait_for_nl` might not be handled correctly.

### Cause of the bug
In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the input prefix starts with a comment line (`# comment`). The buggy function fails to handle this comment correctly when it is preceded by a dedent. It incorrectly consumes the prefix, leading to a comment indentation discrepancy in the output. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of tabs and spaces for the comments in the prefix.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Adjust the logic regarding columns and indents to properly handle comments.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies when to wait for newlines and when to process columns and indents.
3. Implement a clear distinction between tabs and spaces during indentation calculations.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```
