### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a prefix string by consuming characters up to a certain column. It keeps track of the current line, column, and whether it is waiting for a newline character. However, the function fails to correctly handle situations where there are spaces or tabs in the prefix string followed by a comment.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the logic for handling tabs or spaces in the prefix string followed by a comment. The function does not correctly adjust the indentation level for the comment which leads to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the indentation level for comments when encountering spaces or tabs in the prefix string before a comment. We should ensure that comments are properly aligned according to the specified column.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_line += char
            current_column = 0
        else:
            current_line += char            
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issue with comment indentation alignment in the prefix string. By adjusting the logic to properly handle comments following spaces or tabs, the function should now correctly process the prefix string and align comments according to the specified column.
