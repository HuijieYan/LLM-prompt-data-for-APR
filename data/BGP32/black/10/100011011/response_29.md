### Potential Error Locations
1. The logic related to `wait_for_nl` might be causing unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrect handling of tab characters might lead to incorrect column calculations.
3. The condition for updating the `lines` list might not be correct.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a given prefix string based on a specific column value. The function scans the prefix character by character, maintaining the current line, column, and a flag (`wait_for_nl`) to handle newline characters.

The failing test case is related to comment indentation. The issue arises when a comment line follows an indented block and should maintain the same indentation level. The error message indicates a discrepancy in the comment indentation compared to the expected output. The root cause of this bug might be related to the handling of indentation levels and newlines.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a comment line after an indented block, the comment line retains the same level of indentation as the subsequent non-comment line. This requires proper tracking of indentation levels and correctly identifying when a comment line should be added to the `lines` list.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            current_column += 4 if char == '\t' else 1
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column > 0:
                # Maintain comment indentation level
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary
In the corrected version of the function, the indentation logic has been updated to correctly handle maintaining the comment indentation level after dedent operations. By properly managing the current column and newline characters, the function now ensures that comments retain the intended indentation level. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected for the failing test cases.
