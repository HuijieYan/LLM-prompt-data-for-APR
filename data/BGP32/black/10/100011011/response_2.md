### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume part of the input prefix based on indentation logic.
2. The function processes each character of the prefix, adjusting the current column position and handling whitespace characters.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling when a comment line is encountered after an indent level. This leads to incorrect indentation for comments.
4. The issue reported on GitHub points out the incorrect indentation behavior for comments when tabs are used in the input file.
5. The function should correctly handle the indentation level for comments after dedent operations to align with the next line's indentation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the function sets `wait_for_nl = True` whenever non-space characters are encountered, assuming the indentation is finished. This approach is incorrect for handling comments that should maintain the same relative indentation compared to the following line.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to retain the correct indentation for comments. Instead of setting `wait_for_nl = True`, we should ensure that comment lines are correctly handled based on the current column position.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = False  # Reset flag for non-whitespace characters
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By setting `wait_for_nl = False` when encountering non-whitespace characters, we ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation in relation to the subsequent lines. This correction aligns with the expected behavior reported in the GitHub issue.
