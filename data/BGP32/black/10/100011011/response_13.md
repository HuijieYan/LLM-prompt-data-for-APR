### Analysis
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume part of the prefix string based on the indentation level up to a specific column value. The bug in this function is causing the indentation level for comments to be handled incorrectly, leading to the failing test cases related to comment indentation. Based on the provided runtime values and types, we can identify potential issues with how the function processes the input prefix string.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the indentation level when encountering comments in the input string. In the case of comments with spacing or tabs preceding them, the logic for updating the current column and determining the end of indentation is flawed. Specifically, the `''` marker for starting a new line after a comment is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately tracks the column position and handles comments properly when resolving the indentation levels. When encountering comments, the function should update the current_column based on the actual indentation of the comment and ensure that the lines are correctly concatenated. Additionally, the logic for identifying the end of indentation needs to be adjusted to consider comments and empty lines appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    in_comment = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                in_comment = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            if current_column >= column:
                in_comment = True
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            if current_column >= column:
                in_comment = True
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if in_comment:
                current_line += prefix[prefix.index(char):].lstrip()
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to handle comments properly and adjust the current_column, the corrected version of the function should address the issues related to comment indentation and pass the failing test cases mentioned.
