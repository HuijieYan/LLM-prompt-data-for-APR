### Analysis:
1. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix until a given column is reached.
2. The function iterates over the characters in the `prefix` string, updating `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables accordingly.
3. The function checks if `char` is a space, tab, newline, or any other character to determine the behavior during iteration.
4. The error message indicates a comparison failure in the indentation related to comments.
5. The failing test indicates that the comment indentation is not being handled correctly after certain dedent operations.

### Bug:
The bug emerges when the function encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) within the prefix while parsing for indentation levels. After consuming prefix until a certain column, the current logic is not correctly handling comments which might result in incorrect indentation.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle comment indentation after dedent operations.
2. Ensure that the indentation of comments aligns with the overall code structure.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the comment indentation aligns correctly with the code structure even after dedent operations.
