### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix given a certain column value. The issue arises when handling comments preceded by indentation, resulting in incorrect comment indentation after dedent operations. The failure in the test `test_comment_indentation` indicates that the function is not correctly handling the indentation of comments.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for comments when the line is dedented. This occurs due to the mishandling of spaces and tabs in tracking column positions. In cases where a mixed use of spaces and tabs is involved, the function does not differentiate between them properly, leading to incorrect comment alignment.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the different types of whitespace characters (tabs and spaces) when calculating column positions and updating the indentation level. By accurately tracking the position of each character and adjusting the indentation based on tab and space counts, we can fix the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Change this to match tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the code has been modified to correctly handle tab characters and spaces when calculating the column position. By adjusting the column calculation for tabs to match their width, we ensure that the function maintains the correct indentation level for comments regardless of the mix of tabs and spaces in the input prefix.
