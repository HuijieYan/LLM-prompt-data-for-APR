### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to process a given prefix text and consume a part of it based on column and newline characters. The issue arises when dealing with comments that should maintain their original indentation level. The function incorrectly consumes the comment's leading whitespaces causing the indentation issue as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In cases where the prefix contains a comment (lines starting with `#`), the function mistakenly processes the whitespaces before the comment instead of preserving the original indentation.
2. Due to the incorrect handling of whitespaces, the comment's indentation level is altered after dedentations, leading to formatting issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to handle comments correctly, preserving their original indentation level. Specifically, we should ensure that comments following a dedent maintain the same leading whitespace as the code around them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    ignore_indent = False
    for char in prefix:
        if ignore_indent and char in (' ', '\t'):
            current_line += char
            continue

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
                ignore_indent = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            current_line = ""
            ignore_indent = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
            if char == '#':
                ignore_indent = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the issue reported in the GitHub ticket should be resolved, and the failing test case should now pass successfully.
