### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix based on a specific column value. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of tab and newline characters, leading to a deviation in the expected output. The function is incorrectly skipping the proper indentation checks, especially for comments.

Issues:
1. Inconsistent handling of whitespace characters like tabs and spaces.
2. Incorrect adjustment of indentation level when encountering a comment.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the function `_partially_consume_prefix` misinterpreting the indentation levels and not correctly handling the comments, resulting in the mismatch between the actual output and the expected output in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent handling of whitespace characters, especially tabs and spaces.
2. Properly align comments to match the expected indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column >= column:
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version incorporates the logic to properly handle different types of whitespace characters and align comments based on the specified column value. It should address the issues identified and enable the function to pass the failing test cases, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
