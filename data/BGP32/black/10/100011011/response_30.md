### Steps to Fix the Bug:

1. Analyzing the code and error message:
   - The error message indicates a failure in the `assertFormatEqual` test where the expected and actual output do not match due to incorrect comment indentation.
   - The code is responsible for handling indentation and comments but is failing to handle tab indentation correctly.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The `elif char == '\n':` block and the `elif char == ' ':` block could be potential areas where the issue arises.

3. Explanation of the bug:
   - The function is incorrectly handling tab indentation and is not properly aligning the comments.
   - Indentation levels are not being calculated accurately for cases involving tab indentation, leading to incorrect handling of comment lines.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Adjust the logic for handling indentation so that tab indentation is correctly accounted for.
   - Ensure that the comment lines are aligned based on the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab indentation
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Check indentation level before appending to lines
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made:
- Updated the `elif char == '\t':` block to add 4 to `current_column` to correctly handle tab indentation levels.
- Modified the `elif char == '\n':` condition to check indentation level before appending to `lines`.
- Moved the `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` check inside the `elif char == '\n':` block for proper indentation validation.
