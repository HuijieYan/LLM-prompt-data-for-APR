### Bug Analysis:
The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is supposed to consume characters from the `prefix` string until a certain column position is reached. It keeps track of the current line content, column position, and whether it needs to wait for a newline character to finish indenting. However, the bug occurs when handling comments, specifically altering the intended indentation when encountering a comment.

1. When the function encounters a comment in the `prefix`, it doesn't correctly handle the indentation level when the comment spans multiple lines.
2. The function incorrectly adjusts the columns when encountering '\n' and doesn't account for preserving the indentation after comments correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct indentation level is maintained after encountering comments with multiple lines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):
                if not lines:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                else:
                    lines[-1] += current_line
                current_line = ""
                continue
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the handling of comments within the function, we ensure that the correct indentation is maintained when encountering comments spanning multiple lines, and the overall indentation of the code remains consistent. This corrected version should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test case provided.
