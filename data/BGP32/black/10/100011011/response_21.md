### Bug Analysis
The bug is related to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is responsible for partially consuming a prefix string according to certain rules based on indentation levels. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation level of comments when encountered after a dedent operation.

The function's logic seems to be incorrect when it encounters a newline character and needs to differentiate between a newline inside the current indentation and a newline indicating a new line. This causes the function to incorrectly process the remaining prefix after encountering the comment.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the function fails to identify the actual end of the line due to incorrect handling of the newline character when it occurs within the indentation space of the comment. This results in adding `# comment\n` to `lines` which is incorrect.
2. In Case 2, the function incorrectly assumes `wait_for_nl` to be `False` and does not correctly handle the case when encountering a newline during indentation traversal.
3. In Case 3, the function improperly appends `# comment` to `lines` list, leading to incorrect processing of the prefix when a tab is encountered.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Adjust how the function handles the identification of the end of the line when encountering a comment after dedent.
2. Correctly handle the scenarios when a newline character is encountered during the consumption of the prefix.
3. Ensure that the function properly maintains the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char

        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

With these adjustments, the function should be able to correctly consume the prefix string, handling comments after a dedent operation as expected. This corrected version aims to pass the failing test case and resolve the indentation issue reported on GitHub.
