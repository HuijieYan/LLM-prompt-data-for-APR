### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, specifically in handling the indentation of comments. When reaching an indentation level less than the specified `column`, the function incorrectly consumes the prefix for the comment. This behavior results in a misalignment of comments when the input has a combination of tabs and spaces for indentation.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that comments are correctly aligned based on the provided column value. Adjustments are required to properly handle different scenarios like spaces, tabs, and mixed indentations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming each tab is considered as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected function accounts for handle varying indentation levels properly to preserve the alignment of comments at the specified column value. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub and should resolve the failing test case.
