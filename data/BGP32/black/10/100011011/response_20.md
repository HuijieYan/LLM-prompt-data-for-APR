### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume the prefix string based on indentation levels. The issue arises with the handling of indentation within comments, leading to incorrect output after a dedent in case of tabs.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to misinterpreting the indentation level within comments, resulting in incorrect handling after dedent operations, especially with tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of handling indentation levels within comments. Specifically, the function needs to ensure that comments maintain the correct indentation level after dedent operations when using tabs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Adjust for tab spacing
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)  # Add empty lines without indent adjustment
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

By adjusting the tab spacing and correctly handling the indentation levels within comments, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub report.
