### Understanding the Bug
In the provided code snippet, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is meant to partially consume a prefix string based on a given column value. This function encounters an issue when dealing with indentation for comments in specific scenarios as described in the GitHub issue. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent when tabs are used in the input prefix.

### Bug Analysis
The issue arises when the function encounters a tab character (`\t`) within the input prefix. The incorrect indentation occurs when the tab character is not properly accounted for in updating the `current_column` value. This causes the function to misinterpret the correct column position, leading to incorrect output where comments are not aligned with the expected indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tab characters. Tabs should be considered as advancing the column by a fixed number of spaces (e.g., 4). By properly handling tabs during column calculation, the function should be able to correctly determine the indentation level of comments after dedent operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        else:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version now correctly handles tab characters to adjust the current column position accordingly. By considering tabs as advancing the column by multiples of 4 spaces, the function should now be able to properly process input prefixes containing tabs and align comments after dedent operations as expected.
