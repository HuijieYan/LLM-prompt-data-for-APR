### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix text according to specified column index by considering indentation levels. The function appears to have a logic issue related to handling the indentation levels of comments. The error message and failing tests indicate that comments might not maintain correct alignment after dedents, especially for tabs. The function logic is not tracking the correct columnar positions for comment lines after dedents.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it is evident that the current implementation fails to handle the correct column positions and indentation levels of comments properly, especially after dedents. This issue is likely the cause of failing test cases where comments are not aligned as expected after dedents.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and resolve the failing tests, the function's logic related to calculating column positions and handling comment indentation after dedents needs to be revised. Specifically, the function should accurately track the column positions to ensure that comments maintain their alignment based on the provided column index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
After analyzing the bug and considering the runtime values and failing test cases, here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Adjust the logic to handle comment indentation
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Considering tabs as 4 spaces
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column on new line
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the logic related to comment indentation and ensures that comments maintain alignment after dedents according to the specified column index.

By updating the function as described above, the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation after dedents, especially with tabs, should be resolved.
