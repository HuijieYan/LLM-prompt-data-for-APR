### Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation level and column position. The bug causes incorrect handling of lines with comments when the indent is changed. This issue is related to the GitHub issue mentioned, where the incorrect treatment of tabulated comments after dedent is highlighted.

1. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual strings, specifically related to comment indentation.
2. The bug arises in the logic that handles indentation tracking and comment processing within the function.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic when processing comments within different levels of indentation, impacting the final output.
4. To fix the bug, the logic for handling indentation level and comment alignment needs to be adjusted.
5. We will correct the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to ensure proper handling of comments and indentation.

### Correction of the Bug

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent or content line
            if char == '#' and not current_line.strip():
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic to consider comments and ensuring correct handling of indentation levels, the corrected function should now properly consume the prefix according to the intended behavior.

This correction aligns with the reported issue on GitHub related to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent, improving the formatting support, especially for codebases using tabs.
