### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function because the logic for handling comments is incorrect. Specifically, when the function encounters a newline character ('\n'), it does not correctly adjust the indentation level for comments. This leads to incorrect alignment of comments in the returned prefix string.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the indentation level for comments when a newline character is encountered. This involves adjusting the logic to correctly determine the required indentation level for comments based on the current column value.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly handling the indentation for comments after encountering newline characters, the corrected function should now align comments properly, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
