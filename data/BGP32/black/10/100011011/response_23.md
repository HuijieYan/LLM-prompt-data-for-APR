### Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a partial prefix based on a given column value. However, the issue arises when there is an unexpected empty line causing the function to incorrectly split the prefix. This results in incorrect output indentation.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line (`char == '\n'`) and fails to handle it correctly. As a result, the comment indentation after a dedent is affected.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add a condition to check for unexpected empty lines and ensure correct handling.
2. Adjust the logic when encountering newline characters to maintain consistent indentations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic as shown above, the function should now handle unexpected empty lines correctly and preserve the expected comment indentation. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
