### Bug Explanation:

The bug is caused by the function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handling the indentation levels for comments. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to maintain the correct indentation level for the comment, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered after a dedent in the input prefix, the function properly maintains the desired indentation level by aligning it with the correct column.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            if current_column < column:
                current_column = column
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to correctly handle comments after dedents, the corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
