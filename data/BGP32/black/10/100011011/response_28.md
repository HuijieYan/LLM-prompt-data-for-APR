### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string character by character until it reaches a certain column index while respecting indentation levels. The issue seems to arise from how it handles waiting for a new line after encountering a non-space character.

1. The function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. The `wait_for_nl` logic seems to be misplaced, causing unexpected behavior when moving to the next line.

### Bug Cause:
The `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True` when a non-space character is encountered, indicating that the function is expecting a newline character to start a new line. However, when the function encounters a newline character, it sets `current_column` back to 0 but does not handle the logic to append the current line to the lines list correctly.

### Bug Fix:
1. Update the logic after encountering a newline character to properly append the current line before resetting the variables.
2. Adjust the `wait_for_nl` logic to handle transitioning to a new line correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the logic to properly handle resetting variables and transitioning to new lines, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the failing test and on GitHub.
