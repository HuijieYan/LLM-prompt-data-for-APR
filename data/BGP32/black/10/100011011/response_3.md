### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a given string based on a specified column value. The bug occurs when the function encounters a '\n' character, it resets the `current_column` to 0 which results in incorrect calculation of indentation when comparing it against the specified `column` value.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the code block handling '\n' character, specifically where `current_column` is reset to 0.

### Bug Cause:
When processing the input string and encountering a newline character, the `current_column` is reset to 0 unconditionally. This reset affects the comparison logic later on which checks if the indentation level is less than the specified `column`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `current_column` should only be reset to 0 when specifically waiting for a newline character and the condition `current_column < column` should be adjusted to account for the indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs())-1 < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Only reset when waiting for newline
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the specified adjustments, the corrected function should now properly handle the indentation levels and comparison against the specified column value.
