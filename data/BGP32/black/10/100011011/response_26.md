### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for consuming a prefix string up to a given column number while handling indentation, including tab characters. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with indentation for comments after dedent when using tabs. Based on the failing test and runtime values, it is evident that the function is not correctly handling the expected indentation for comments.

### Bug Cause:
- The function incorrectly handles the indentation level after a dedent operation.
- In the case of tab characters, the function does not correctly determine the required indentation level for comments, leading to incorrect formatting.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that when a newline character is encountered, the function correctly determines the indentation level for the subsequent line, especially when dealing with tabs.
2. Adjust the logic to handle tab characters accurately to maintain consistent indentation levels.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust tab column width to 8
        elif char == '\n':
            # Check and adjust column level for tabs before newline
            current_column = 0
            for c in current_line:
                if c == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif c == '\t':
                    current_column += 8 - (current_column % 8)  # Adjust tab column width to 8
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Applying this corrected version should address the issue of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation when using tabs in the input.
