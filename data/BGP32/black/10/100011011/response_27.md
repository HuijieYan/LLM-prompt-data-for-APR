### Bug Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix from the input string until reaching a specific column value while preserving the indentation structure. The bug seems to occur when encountering comments that might not align correctly with the code due to incorrect handling of whitespaces and newlines.

Based on the runtime values and types, it is evident that the function is not correctly preserving the indentation of comments. The issue arises when the indentation is followed by a comment, causing the comment's alignment to deviate from the actual code after parsing. This is validated by the failing test scenario where the comment is not indented correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the condition where the function needs to preserve the indentation of comments accurately to maintain the original code structure.

### Bug Cause:
- The function incorrectly handles the indentation of comments, especially after dedenting, causing improper alignment of comments relative to the code.
- When encountering a comment after dedenting, the function fails to align it correctly, leading to a discrepancy between the original and formatted code.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles comments after dedenting to ensure they maintain the correct alignment relative to the code. Specifically, the function should handle whitespace characters before comments accurately to preserve the original structure.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True  # Consider comments as part of the current line
            elif char.strip():  # Handle non-empty characters other than comments
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of comments and indentations after dedenting, this corrected function should now correctly preserve the original code structure, ensuring the comments are aligned properly. This updated logic should address the error reported in the failing test scenario and the GitHub issue related to misaligned comments after dedenting.
