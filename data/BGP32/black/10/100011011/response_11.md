### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the indentation level for comments after a dedent when the input file uses tabs. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function fails to correctly preserve the relative indentation of comments. This results in the indentation level of comments being changed incorrectly after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function maintains the correct indentation level for comments after a dedent operation. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic within the function to correctly handle the indentation levels based on tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                for line in lines[::-1]:
                    if line.lstrip().startswith("#"):
                        leading_spaces = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())
                        if leading_spaces < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                wait_for_nl = False
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By checking the indentation level of comments correctly after a dedent operation, the corrected version of the function should now preserve the relative indentation of comments, thereby resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
