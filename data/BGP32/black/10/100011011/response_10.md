### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a certain part of a string based on a given column value. However, the issue arises specifically when dealing with comments and indentation levels, especially with tabs. The function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.

### Potential Error Location
The issue is likely happening when the function encounters a newline character after parsing a comment or indentation. The logic related to updating `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` seems to be the source of the problem.

### Cause of the Bug
The `wait_for_nl` check is set to `True` once the function encounters a character that is not a tab, space, or newline. Subsequently, when a newline character is encountered, the function should handle updating the `lines` list and resetting the line counters. However, due to the faulty logic, the comment indentation is not properly preserved after a dedent operation, leading to incorrect formatting. This issue is further exacerbated when tabs are involved, as their handling is inconsistent.

### Fixing the Bug
To resolve this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the function to handle comment indentation correctly, especially after a dedent operation. We should ensure that the comment indentation matches the surrounding code indentation consistently. This could involve revising how the `lines` list is updated and managing the transition between different levels of indentation properly.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = column
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version aims to address the issues related to comment indentation preservation, especially after dedent operations. It ensures that the comment lines maintain consistent indentation levels with the surrounding code. After applying this fix, the function should handle the input cases correctly and pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
