### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the condition where the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to True when encountering an indentation character (space or tab) after a non-empty line. This flag should only be set to True after encountering a non-indentation character.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to set the `wait_for_nl` flag to True only after encountering a non-indentation character. This ensures that the function correctly handles the indentation and newline characters while consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic in the `else` block to set the `wait_for_nl` flag based on indentation characters, ensuring that it aligns with the correct behavior expected when dealing with prefixes containing comments and code indentation.
