### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume part of a given prefix based on a specified column. However, the bug lies in the handling of cases where the indentation level is not correct. The function fails to correctly handle the scenario where there is an unexpected empty line, causing the consumed prefix to be incorrect.

### Bug Location
The bug occurs in the section of the code where the function encounters a '\n' character and there is an unexpected empty line. The current implementation resets the `current_column` to 0, but it should also clear the `current_line` and set `wait_for_nl` to False to handle this scenario correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling the unexpected empty line when encountering a '\n' character. We should clear the `current_line`, reset `current_column` to 0, and set `wait_for_nl` to False in that case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Handle unexpected empty line
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By incorporating the correct handling of unexpected empty lines in the function, it should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected output.
