### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a certain column and return the consumed portion along with the remaining part of the prefix. The bug arises when there is a comment in the prefix with a different indentation level from the target column. The function fails to handle this situation correctly, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

In the failing test case, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to the desired column when there is a comment with different indentation. This results in the function returning an incorrect prefix, causing the assertion error in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the indentation of comments properly and ensure that the prefix is consumed correctly up to the target column. One potential strategy is to detect the presence of a comment in the prefix and adjust the logic to handle such cases correctly. By considering the different indentation levels of comments, the function can successfully consume the prefix up to the desired column.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Detect comment and adjust indentation
            if not current_line.strip():  # Ignore comments at the beginning
                continue
            current_column = max(current_column, column)  # Adjust column to handle comments
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the logic to handle comments in the prefix with different indentations correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
