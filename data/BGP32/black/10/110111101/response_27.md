### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to correctly consume the prefix string based on the specified column value. This results in incorrect output in cases where there are comments in the code that need to be correctly indented.

The main issue lies in how the function handles the case where a comment is encountered. Instead of correctly aligning the comment based on the column value provided, the function fails to adjust the comment position, leading to incorrect output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly accounts for comments when determining the appropriate indentation level based on the specified column value. Specifically, the function should update the current column position when encountering comments and adjust the indentation level accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function to handle comments appropriately when determining the indentation level, the corrected version should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
