### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from the incorrect handling of whitespace (spaces and tabs). In certain cases, the function fails to correctly identify the column position of the text when dealing with tabs and spaces, leading to incorrect indentation calculations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately calculates the column position by correctly accounting for the spaces and tabs in the prefix string.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column//4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Changes Made
- Fixed the calculation for tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` using a formula to account for each tab increment.
- Adjusted the tab calculation to ensure the correct column position tracking.
