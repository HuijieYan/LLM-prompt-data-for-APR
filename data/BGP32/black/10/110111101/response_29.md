### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling the indentation correctly, causing the test to fail. The issue arises when the function encounters a comment line after passing the indentation check, leading to incorrect output.

The function incorrectly checks for the comment position only after the indentation is finished, which leads to the wrong behavior. It should verify the comment position within the indentation process to ensure correct handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the function to check for comments within the indentation process, rather than only after finishing the indentation check. By incorporating the comment position validation in the indentation process, we can ensure that the correct output is generated.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            current_column += 1
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function includes the additional condition to handle comment position validation during the indentation process, ensuring that the function correctly consumes the prefix while handling comments within the expected column boundary.
