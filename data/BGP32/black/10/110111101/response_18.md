The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles the indentation levels and waits for a new line character. When encountering a new line character, the function should check if the current indentation level is less than the specified column value before accepting the new line as part of the result.

The bug occurs when the function incorrectly updates the `current_column` value when encountering a new line character, instead of checking the indentation level. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation level and causes the function to return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to correctly handle the indentation levels and ensure that the new line character is considered only if the current indentation level is less than the specified column value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:  # Check the indentation level before accepting the new line
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the indentation levels and return the expected results for the test cases.
