### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments in the input prefix. This causes the function to return incorrect results when trying to adjust the indentation level of comments in the input prefix.

In the failing test, when the input prefix contains a comment with leading spaces or tabs, the function fails to properly handle the comment's indentation level. This results in the function returning an incorrectly adjusted prefix, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Location:
The bug is mainly located in the logic that handles the indentation levels while processing characters in the input prefix. Specifically, the handling of spaces, tabs, and newline characters needs to be adjusted to correctly maintain the correct column position and indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the indentation levels of comments. This includes properly tracking the column position, indenting the comments as needed, and adjusting the overall formatting of the prefix.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle the indentation levels of comments in the input prefix, leading to a successful execution of the failing test.
