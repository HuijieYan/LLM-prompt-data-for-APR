### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the newline character '\n' in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering '\n' in the input prefix string, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` to 0, assuming it should start a new line, even though it should maintain the current indentation level. This leads to misalignments in the output.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling '\n' in the prefix string. Instead of resetting the `current_column` to 0, we should maintain the existing indentation level when encountering a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    indent = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
                    if current_line.strip() and indent < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = indent
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By maintaining the correct indentation level when handling '\n' characters, this corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
