### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition for appending the `current_line` to `lines`. The condition `if char == '\n':` is causing an issue as it resets the `current_column` to 0 even if it's not the end of the line. This incorrect reset leads to incorrect comparisons and mismatched outputs.

To fix this bug, we should only reset `current_column` to 0 when it's actually the end of the line, designated by an empty `current_line` at `current_column < column`. We will adjust the logic to correctly handle line endings and line continuation.

### Corrected Version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
      
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

By making this change, the function will correctly handle line endings and line continuations, ensuring that the correct prefix is consumed based on the given column value.
