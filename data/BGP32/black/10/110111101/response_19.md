### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from incorrectly handling cases where there are spaces or tabs before a comment in the given `prefix` string. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` value when encountering spaces or tabs, leading to incorrect line formations and failing the test cases involving comments with different indentations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `current_column` is updated properly when encountering spaces or tabs in the `prefix` string. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where comments have varying levels of indentation relative to the line they are in.

### Correction:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Line break encountered
            if current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # Start of content
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle varying levels of indentation correctly, ensuring that comments are consumed based on the provided `column` value. This correction should pass the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
