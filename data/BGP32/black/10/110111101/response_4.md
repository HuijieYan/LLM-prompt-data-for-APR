### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs because the `wait_for_nl` flag is not properly reset after handling a newline character. This leads to incorrect handling of indentation levels and the detection of empty lines. As a result, the function fails to correctly consume the prefix up to a specified column and return the remaining prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is properly reset when encountering a newline character. This will allow the function to correctly handle the indentation levels and empty lines within the prefix.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset wait_for_nl flag
            wait_for_nl = False
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag when encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now be able to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column and return the remaining prefix.
