### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic flow related to handling indentation and waiting for new lines. The function is not correctly updating the `current_column` count and checking the indentation level. It fails to correctly detect when to wait for a new line and breaks the content of the prefix wrongly.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic surrounding the indentation and new line handling. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `current_column` count is updated accurately based on tabs and spaces, and that the function correctly waits for a new line when a new indentation level is expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here, I present the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

This corrected version adjusts the logic for updating the `current_column` count and properly handling the wait for a new line based on the indentation level. It should now correctly consume the prefix as intended and pass the failing test cases.
