### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` fails to properly handle the indentation level of comments in the prefix input. When a comment is encountered, the function incorrectly resets the `current_column` without considering the existing indentation level. This leads to incorrect output when comparing the formatted strings in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to store the existing indentation level before encountering a comment and resume from that level after processing the comment. This will ensure that the indentation is preserved correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    indent_level = 0
    
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = indent_level
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            indent_level = 0
        else:
            indent_level = current_column
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

The provided corrected version stores and restores the `indent_level` when encountering comments, ensuring that the indentation is maintained correctly. This version should pass the failing test cases.
