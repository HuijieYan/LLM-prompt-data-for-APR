## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the handling of indentation levels and new lines. The function is intended to partially consume a prefix string until a certain column position is reached. However, the logic for tracking the current column position and when to wait for a new line is not correctly implemented. This leads to incorrect handling of the indentation and new line characters, resulting in unexpected output.

In the failing test case for `test_comment_indentation`, the function is expected to correctly consume the prefix string until it reaches a specific column position based on indentation levels. However, due to the bug, the function fails to handle the correct indentation and new line characters, causing the actual output to deviate from the expected output.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the handling of new lines (`'\n'`) and the decision-making process for updating the current column position and waiting for a new line. The logic for managing these aspects is not correctly implemented, causing the function to misbehave when processing the prefix string.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the logic for tracking the current column position and managing new lines needs to be revised. Specifically, the function should correctly update the current column position when encountering spaces, tabs, and new lines. Additionally, the function should accurately determine when to wait for a new line based on the indentation levels.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # check for column condition before newline
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By fixing the logic related to handling new lines and updating the column position, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and produce the expected output.
