### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the case where a newline character is encountered while waiting for a new line. When the function encounters a newline character, it resets the `current_column` to 0, which should not happen according to the logic of the function. This leads to incorrect formatting of the lines, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is only reset to 0 when a newline character is encountered after reaching the specified `column` value. This adjustment will maintain the correct column count during the indentation process.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the indentation and formatting of the input prefixes, resulting in a passing test.
