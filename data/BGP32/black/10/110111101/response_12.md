The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the handling of indentation when encountering a comment line. The current implementation fails to maintain the correct indent level in certain cases, leading to the issues observed in the failing test.

### Analysis:
1. The function is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column index while preserving line breaks and indentation levels.
2. The bug likely occurs when processing comment lines, causing incorrect indentation levels compared to the expected output.
3. Based on the failing test, the function fails to handle comment lines with correct indentation, resulting in differences between the actual and expected output.
4. The `wait_for_nl` flag is crucial for detecting the end of an indented block, but it might not be set/reset at the correct points within the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is set/reset appropriately when encountering different characters to correctly track indentation levels.
2. Check the logic related to handling comment lines to maintain indentation consistency.
3. Update the function to handle indentations caused by various characters consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl and char != ' ' and char != '\t':
            wait_for_nl = False

        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of the `wait_for_nl` flag and indentation logic, the corrected function should now correctly consume the prefix string up to the specified column while maintaining the correct indentation levels. This version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
