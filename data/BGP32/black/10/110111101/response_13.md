The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition for handling the case when encountering a newline character. The current implementation is not correctly resetting the `current_line` and `current_column` variables when reaching a new line. This causes issues with the expected indentation levels and breaks the functioning of the function.

To fix this bug, we should reset `current_line` and `current_column` whenever a newline character is encountered, regardless of the `wait_for_nl` condition. This ensures that the function correctly handles newline characters and maintains the indentation level properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the condition for handling newline characters and resetting the necessary variables, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
