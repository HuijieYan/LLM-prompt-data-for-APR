### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of lines and character columns. The function is supposed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, it fails to correctly handle cases where the indentation uses a mix of spaces and tabs.

The function fails when encountering a mix of tabs and spaces for indentation and a newline character in the input prefix string. It incorrectly considers a newline character as an indicator of an empty line, which leads to incorrect behavior in determining the consumed part.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, we need to adjust the logic related to handling different types of indentation (spaces and tabs) and properly account for newline characters in the prefix. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly tracks the column position regardless of the type of indentation used.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class Driver(object):
    
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False

        for char in prefix:
            # Update current_line and current_column based on different characters
            current_line += char
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Account for newline characters
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif wait_for_nl:
                wait_for_nl = False

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it should now properly handle cases of mixed indentation styles and newline characters in the prefix string, addressing the bug and allowing it to pass the failing test cases.
