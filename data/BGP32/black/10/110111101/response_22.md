### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the incorrect handling of the indentation levels when encountering comments within the prefix. The function fails to adjust the current column correctly after processing the comment lines, leading to misalignment between the actual and expected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the current column is updated correctly when encountering comment lines or the end of the prefix. Additionally, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle different types of indentation characters (spaces, tabs) to maintain accurate column tracking.

### Corrected Version

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if not current_line.startswith('#'):
                    # Increment column upon encountering a non-comment line break
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    # Reset the column counter for comments
                    current_column = len(current_line.lstrip())
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle comment lines and adjust column tracking accordingly to pass the failing test.
