### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` tries to handle indentation in a given prefix text by checking for spaces, tabs, and newlines.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function manages newlines and indentation levels, resulting in incorrect output for certain cases.
- In the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the function fails to correctly handle comments when the indentation levels vary.
- The error message shows that the function does not produce the expected output due to misalignment of comments after fixing the indentation.

### Bug Cause
- The function fails to properly reset `current_line` and `current_column` values when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect tracking of the current indentation level.
- When a newline is encountered, it should reset `current_line` and `current_column` to correctly handle the next line's indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the function to properly reset `current_line` and `current_column` when encountering a newline character.
- Ensure that the function correctly updates the variables for tracking indentation levels.
- Update the function logic to handle comments and indentation consistently. 

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line = ''
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By ensuring that `current_line` and `current_column` are correctly updated when encountering a newline character, this corrected version of the function should now handle indentation and comments properly, passing the failing test cases.
