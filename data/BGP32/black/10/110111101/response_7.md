### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is caused by incorrect handling of indentation and newlines. The function fails to properly consume the prefix up to the specified column while preserving the original formatting correctly.

The issue arises when the function encounters a newline character (`\n`) and the `wait_for_nl` flag is set to `True`, indicating that an indent has finished. In this scenario, instead of starting a new line to continue the indentation process, the function incorrectly puts the current character as the first character of the new line. This leads to a misalignment of the indentation levels, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when we encounter a newline character and `wait_for_nl` is `True`, a new line should be started properly for the next indentation level. Additionally, we need to ensure that the current column count is correctly updated based on spaces and tabs encountered.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:
                # start a new line and reset the current_line
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these corrections, the function should now properly handle the indentation levels, preserve the formatting, and pass the failing test cases.
