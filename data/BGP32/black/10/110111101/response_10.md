### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function stems from how the function handles the occurrence of a newline character (`\n`) in the input `prefix`. When encountering a `\n`, the function resets `current_column` to 0, which can lead to incorrect handling of the remaining characters in `prefix`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly maintains the correct indentation level when encountering newline characters. We should update the logic to properly track the column position across newlines.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py

class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_column = len(current_line) - len(current_line.lstrip())
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to track the actual column position after encountering a newline character, the corrected function should now handle the indentation correctly and pass the failing test cases.
