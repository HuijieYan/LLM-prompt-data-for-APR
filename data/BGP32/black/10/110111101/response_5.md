### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_partially_consume_prefix` incorrectly handles the indentation variations in the input text, leading to incorrect output compared to the expected values. It fails to correctly skip over comments when calculating the indentation level while consuming the prefix.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation levels and skips over comments to accurately determine the prefix that needs to be consumed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            elif char == '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections, the function should now handle comments and indentation levels correctly, ensuring it returns the expected prefix that needs to be consumed based on the specified column value.
