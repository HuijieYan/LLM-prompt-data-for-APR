### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for consuming whitespace characters up to a specified column in a given string. The function fails to correctly handle the case where a comment is encountered within the prefix string. This leads to incorrect output in the failing test case related to comment indentation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of comments within the prefix string.
2. Logic for processing newline characters.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that when a comment character ('#') is encountered within the prefix string, the function does not properly handle it and fails to update the column count.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to update the logic in the function to handle comments correctly by resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag and column count appropriately.
- We should also ensure that newline characters are handled correctly to maintain the correct column count.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        elif char == '#':  # Handle comments
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above to properly handle comments and newline characters, the corrected version should pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
