### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix up to a certain column while handling tab and space characters as indentation. The function seems to have issues regarding the handling of newlines and preserving indentation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `if char == '\n':` block, the current_column is not being reset to 0, which might cause issues with calculating the indentation correctly.
2. The logic for handling `wait_for_nl` and building `lines` seems to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of newlines and when to reset the indentation calculated in `current_column`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.
2. Revisit the logic for `wait_for_nl` and handling `lines`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections to the function, the test `test_comment_indentation` should pass without any errors.
