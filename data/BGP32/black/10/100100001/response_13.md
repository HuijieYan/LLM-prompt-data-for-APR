## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is used to remove a prefix from a string while keeping track of the column position. The bug seems to be related to handling newline characters and keeping track of the indentation level correctly.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when encountering a newline character. The function should reset the current_column to 0, but it mistakenly does this outside the `if char == '\n':` block. This causes incorrect column tracking and results in the failing test for comment indentation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when encountering a newline character, the current_column is reset to 0 without affecting the other conditions related to column tracking and indentation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # reset column tracking on newline
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correctly resetting the `current_column` value only when encountering a newline character, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test for comment indentation.
