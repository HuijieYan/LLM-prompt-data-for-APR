### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix text up to a specific column. However, there are issues related to handling tabs and newlines which are causing it to not work correctly.

### Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of tabs in calculating the current column position.
2. Incorrect logic for identifying when to wait for a new line `wait_for_nl`.
3. Problematic management of lines list.
4. Incorrect indentation checks causing unexpected behavior.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tabs causing the current column position to be miscalculated. This leads to incorrect decisions about starting a new line or continuing on the same line, resulting in an unexpected behavior where the prefix is not consumed accurately up to the specified column.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for handling tabs and calculating the current column.
2. Correctly manage checking when to wait for a new line.
3. Fix the handling of the lines list to capture the correct prefix text up to the specified column.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # adjust for tab position
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the tab handling, new line logic, and the lines list management, the corrected version of the function should now properly consume the prefix up to the specified column, fixing the bug related to incorrect prefix consumption.
