The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function occurs when the newline character is encountered within the loop. At that point, the `current_column` is reset to 0, which causes incorrect indentation calculation.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is only reset to 0 when the newline character is not preceded by any whitespace characters. This can be achieved by moving the `current_column = 0` line inside the `if char == '\n':` block.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():  # Check if current line is empty
                current_line = ""  # Clear the empty line
            else:
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
