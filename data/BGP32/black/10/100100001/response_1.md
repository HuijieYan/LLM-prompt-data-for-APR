The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is related to how it handles the waiting for a newline character (`wait_for_nl`). When it encounters a newline character, it does not reset `current_line` to empty, leading to incorrect line processing.

To fix this bug, we should reset `current_line` to an empty string when encountering a newline character regardless of the condition. This will ensure that each line is processed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""  # Reset current_line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""  # Reset current_line unconditionally
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle newline characters correctly and pass the failing test case.
