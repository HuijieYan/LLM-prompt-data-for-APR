### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to partially consume a prefix string based on a specified column. The function fails to correctly handle the situation where there is an unexpected blank line ('\n') in the prefix string. This results in incorrect output and a failing test case `test_comment_indentation` in the test file.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of unexpected blank lines ('\n').
2. Incorrectly updating the current column count.
3. Incorrectly appending lines to the result.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line ('\n') in the prefix string. The function does not reset the current column count to 0 when encountering a newline character, leading to incorrect calculation of the column. This causes the function to incorrectly handle subsequent characters and append lines, resulting in a mismatch with the expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling newline characters in the prefix string. Specifically, when encountering a newline character, we should reset the current column count to 0 and skip any whitespace characters until the next non-whitespace character is encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                # Reset current column count to 0 for new line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                # Indent finished
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                # Handle unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                continue  # Skip processing newline character
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if not wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic for handling newline characters, resetting the current column count, and correctly determining when the indent is finished, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
