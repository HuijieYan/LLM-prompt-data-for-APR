The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition `if char == '\n':`. When encountering a newline character (`\n`), the function resets the `current_column` to 0, which causes incorrect handling of indentation levels in the input code leading to failing the test case `test_comment_indentation`.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the code to correctly handle indentation levels and newline characters. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    # Append the remaining characters to the current line
    lines.append(current_line)

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This corrected version handles newline characters correctly and maintains the correct indentation levels while consuming the prefix characters. It should now be able to pass the failing test case `test_comment_indentation`.
