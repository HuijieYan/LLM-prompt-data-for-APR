## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume a prefix of whitespace from a given input string until a certain column is reached. The bug appears to be related to how the function processes newline characters.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line while processing the input prefix. This leads to incorrect behavior in handling the whitespace and column tracking, resulting in the function failing to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic related to handling newline characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that empty lines are handled correctly without affecting the column tracking and whitespace consumption.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip(): 
                lines.append(current_line)  # Add the current line if not empty
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now handle empty lines correctly and consume the prefix up to the specified column without issues. The corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
