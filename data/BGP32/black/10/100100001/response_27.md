## Analysis:
1. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function in the `driver.py` file is designed to consume a prefix string until reaching a specific column limit.
2. The function seems to be incorrectly handling the case when encountering a new line character (`\n`).
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks for correct indentation handling in the presence of comments.
4. The bug likely occurs when a comment is encountered on a new line and the function incorrectly handles the column count.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the `_partially_consume_prefix` function encounters a new line character in the prefix string.
- In this case, it resets the `current_column` to 0 unconditionally, which is incorrect behavior, leading to incorrect column counting and output.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition for resetting the `current_column` when encountering a new line character to only do so if whitespace characters follow the new line.
- Adjust the handling of the `current_column` based on the encountered characters in the prefix.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip():
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By implementing the corrections explained above, the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle new line characters correctly, ensuring the appropriate column count and output.
