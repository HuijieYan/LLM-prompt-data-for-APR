## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix based on indentation in the given code snippet. The function seems to be incorrectly identifying when to stop consuming the prefix and return the consumed portion along with the remaining part.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if the current character is ' ' or '\t' may not accurately track the column position.
2. The logic for handling '\n' might not be correctly resetting the `current_column` counter.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the column count and the conditions for consuming the prefix. This leads to an incorrect determination of when to stop consuming the prefix.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for tracking the column position accurately and ensure that the function correctly identifies the end of the indent to stop consuming the prefix.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0  # Reset column count correctly
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` correctly when encountering '\n' and ensuring the conditions for indentation are appropriately handled, the corrected version of the function should be able to consume the prefix accurately.
