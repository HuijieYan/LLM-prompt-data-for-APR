The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the condition where it checks if `char == '\n'` to reset the `current_column` to 0. This causes the function to incorrectly reset the column count even when the newline character is within the indentation level.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for resetting the `current_column` only when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline. This will ensure that the column count is reset correctly at the end of an indentation level.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version ensures that the `current_column` is only reset to 0 when encountering a newline character while waiting for a newline, fixing the bug and allowing the provided test cases to pass successfully.
