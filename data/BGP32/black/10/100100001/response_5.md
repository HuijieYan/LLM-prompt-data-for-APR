## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation levels. The function keeps track of the current line, column, and whether to wait for a new line or not. However, the logic for handling indentation levels and new lines seems to be incorrect, leading to failing test cases related to comment indentation.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the logic for handling indentation levels and processing new lines. It fails to correctly handle indentation levels and does not properly consume the prefix string according to the specified column.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling indentation levels and new lines. We should ensure that the function accurately tracks the current column and processes each character of the prefix string correctly.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # handle new line correctly
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is not finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Updating the function to correctly handle new lines and indentation levels should resolve the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
