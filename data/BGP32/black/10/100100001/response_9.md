## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on a given column and return the consumed prefix along with the remaining prefix. However, there are errors in the function that cause it to not work correctly, resulting in failing tests related to comment indentation.

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` seems incorrect as it checks if the current line is non-empty and the current column is less than the specified column. This logic may not correctly handle the desired behavior.

2. The handling of indentation with spaces and tabs might be causing issues based on the given test cases.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect logic in the condition for consuming the prefix based on the column. The way indentation with spaces and tabs is handled might also lead to incorrect results for comment indentation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition for consuming the prefix based on the desired column to ensure it accurately captures the intended behavior.
2. Review and adjust the logic related to handling indentation with spaces and tabs to align with the test cases.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for i, char in enumerate(prefix):
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the above corrections in place, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle consuming the prefix based on the specified column and align with the expected behavior in the failing test cases related to comment indentation.
