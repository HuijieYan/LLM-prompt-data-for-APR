## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is supposed to partially consume a prefix by checking indentation levels. However, the bug seems to be related to the calculation of the column number when encountering tabs and spaces.

### Bug Identification:
The bug seems to occur when calculating the current column based on tabs and spaces. The function should correctly track the number of spaces added by tabs (\t) and spaces, which seems to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistencies in tracking the correct column number when encountering tabs, spaces, and newlines. This leads to incorrect indentation detection.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. Ensure that the function correctly calculates the column number by properly handling tabs, spaces, and newlines.
2. Focus on accurately counting the column offset based on tabs and spaces to determine the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust column count based on how many spaces a tab represents
            current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Outcome:
The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle tabs, spaces, and newlines to accurately calculate the indentation level, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.
