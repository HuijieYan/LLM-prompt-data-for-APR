## Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume a prefix of characters until a certain column limit is reached. However, there are errors in the logic of the function that cause it to fail when handling indentation with spaces or tabs.

## Bugs in the buggy function:
1. When encountering a tab character ('\t'), the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4 instead of 1.
2. The logic for handling indentation level and waiting for a newline character ('\\n') is flawed, leading to incorrect prefix consumption.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle tab characters correctly and does not properly track the current column and wait for newline logic.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for handling tab characters to increment `current_column` by 1.
2. Adjust the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for newline characters to accurately consume the prefix up to the specified column limit.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying these corrections, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column limit, passing the failing test case provided.
