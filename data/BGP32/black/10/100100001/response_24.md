The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not correctly handling the indentation level when consuming the prefix input. This causes the function to incorrectly determine the indentation level of the lines.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a tab character '\t' while consuming the prefix. The function is using `current_column += 4` to calculate the column number, assuming each tab character advances the column by 4 spaces. However, this assumption is incorrect as the indentation level should be calculated based on the current position relative to the previous tab stop.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the calculation of the column when encountering a tab character. We should determine the correct column position based on the current column position and the actual tab width.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    tab_width = 4  # set the tab width to 4 as an example, adjust as needed

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column + tab_width - 1) // tab_width) * tab_width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By using the corrected tab width calculation, the function should now correctly consume the prefix and handle the indentation levels properly. This should address the bug and ensure that the function works as intended with the provided test cases.
