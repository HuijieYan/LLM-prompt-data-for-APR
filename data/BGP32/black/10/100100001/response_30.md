### Analysis:
The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is intended to consume characters in a prefix string until a certain column is reached. It then returns the consumed characters and the remaining characters. The bug may be related to the handling of tabs and spaces, causing incorrect indentation in the output.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The issue may arise from the way tab characters are handled in the calculation of the current column.

### Cause of the Bug:
The incorrect handling of tab characters leads to an incorrect calculation of the current column, causing the function to misinterpret the indentation level.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle tab characters and adjust the calculation of the current column based on tabs and spaces.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Adjust for tab stop
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the calculation of the current column based on the tab stops, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle tab characters and maintain the correct indentation level.
