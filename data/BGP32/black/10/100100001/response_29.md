### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix until a certain column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. The function appears to be incorrectly handling the indentation levels.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Calculation of the `current_column` based on spaces and tabs.
2. Handling of newline characters and resetting `current_column`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect calculation of the `current_column` when encountering spaces or tabs, leading to the incorrect identification of the indentation level.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Correctly update the `current_column` based on spaces and tabs.
- Reset `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The corrected version includes adjustments to correctly update the `current_column` when encountering spaces and tabs, ensuring the correct identification of the indentation level. Additionally, it resets `current_column` to 0 when encountering a newline character to handle the indentation correctly.
