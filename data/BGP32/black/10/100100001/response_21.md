After analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, the issue seems to be with the logic that handles indentation levels and newlines. The function is supposed to consume part of a prefix until a certain column is reached, but there are errors in handling whitespace characters and newlines.

One potential cause of the bug could be that the function is not correctly counting the column position when encountering tabs or spaces.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for updating the `current_column` variable based on the encountered characters, and correctly handle the newline characters to determine when to stop consuming the prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                current_line += char
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the indentation levels and newlines correctly, ensuring that the prefix is consumed until the specified column is reached.
