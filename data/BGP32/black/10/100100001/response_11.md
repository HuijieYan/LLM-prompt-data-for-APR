The bug in the _partially_consume_prefix function is related to the handling of the wait_for_nl flag when encountering a newline character. Instead of resetting the current_line and current_column values when wait_for_nl is True, it appends the current_line to the lines list. This causes incorrect behavior when processing the indentation of the code.

To fix this issue, we need to reset the current_line and current_column values when wait_for_nl is True, instead of appending the current_line to the lines list. This will ensure that the correct prefix is extracted based on the specified column.

Here is the corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying this correction, the _partially_consume_prefix function should work correctly and pass the failing test provided.
