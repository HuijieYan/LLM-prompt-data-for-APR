After analyzing the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix`, it seems that the issue lies in the logic of handling the current column when encountering a tab character (`\t`). The current implementation increments `current_column` by 4 for each tab character, which is incorrect as tab characters should be treated as advancing to the next multiple of 8 columns.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling tab characters should be adjusted to increment `current_column` to the next multiple of 8 columns. Also, the condition for checking if the line is empty in the buggy code is not correct, and it should be fixed.

Below is the corrected version of the function `_partially_consume_prefix`:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 8 + 1) * 8  # move to next multiple of 8 columns
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these corrections to handle tab characters correctly and fixing the check for empty lines, the function should now properly consume the given prefix and return the expected result when used in the test case provided.
