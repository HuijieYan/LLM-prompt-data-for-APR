## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume a prefix of text up to a specific column in the given input. The bug seems to be related to handling newline characters and determining when to stop consuming characters.

## Bug:
The issue lies in the condition that checks if `wait_for_nl` is True when encountering a newline character. The code resets the `current_column` count to 0 whenever a newline character is encountered, which does not align with the intention of maintaining the column count. This behavior causes the function to incorrectly consume characters after a newline.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of newline characters and maintain the column count correctly without resetting it. We should only reset the `current_column` count when reaching the specified column for the prefix.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Only reset the wait_for_nl flag if not empty line
            if current_line.strip():
                wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making the proposed corrections, the function should now correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column without resetting the column count when encountering newline characters. This corrected version should fix the bug encountered in the failing test mentioned earlier.
