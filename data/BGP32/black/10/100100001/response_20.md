## Analysis:
- The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is designed to consume whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines) up to a certain column position.
- It accumulates lines till a newline character is encountered and then checks if the accumulated line contains text and if it is up to the specified column position.
- If the conditions are met, it returns the consumed prefix and the remaining prefix.
- The bug is likely related to how the function handles the newline character and the condition to check the column position.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters an unexpected empty line (newline character) while consuming the prefix. It does not reset the `current_column` counter to zero in this case which leads to incorrect column counting.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to reset the `current_column` counter to zero whenever a newline character is encountered, irrespective of whether the line is empty or not.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Reset column count for newline
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the function should now handle the unexpected empty lines properly and fix the bug identified in the failing test case.
