The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is intended to consume the prefix consisting of whitespace characters until reaching a certain column value. However, there is a bug in the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` which checks if the current line is not empty before comparing the column value. This bug causes the function to skip processing the last line when it ends with a newline character ("\n").

The strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the condition to check if the stripped current_line is not empty or if the loop has reached the end of the prefix. Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() or current_column >= column or len(prefix) == len(current_line):
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With this correction, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the prefix correctly and pass the failing test for comment indentation.
