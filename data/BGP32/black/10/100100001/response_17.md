There are a couple of potential locations where the bug could be causing the failing test:
1. The `if wait_for_nl` condition might not be properly resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a newline character.
2. The condition for checking the column value `current_column < column` seems to be incorrect and may not be handling the indentation properly.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Reset the `wait_for_nl` flag after encountering a newline character by setting `wait_for_nl = False`.
2. Update the condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column` to properly handle the indentation detection.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version should properly handle the indentation and newline characters, allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
