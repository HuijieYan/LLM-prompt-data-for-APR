### Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix of characters until a certain column limit is reached. The function seems to have an issue with handling new lines and column counts correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of new lines (`\n`) and indentation levels seems to be causing the issue.
2. There might be an issue with resetting the `current_column` value when encountering a new line.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect calculation of the `current_column` value when processing new lines and detecting indentation levels, leading to incorrect behavior when consuming the prefix.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` value is updated correctly when encountering different characters, especially new lines (`\n`) and various types of indentation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

By updating the logic for handling new lines and correctly managing the `current_column` value, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
