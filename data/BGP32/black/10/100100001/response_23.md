The issue in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function arises from the logic related to handling tab characters. When encountering a tab character, the function incorrectly increments `current_column` by 4, instead of calculating the actual increase in column position caused by the tab character.

To address this bug, we need to update the logic for handling tab characters to correctly calculate the column position. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Correct tab increment logic
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version fixes the issue with tab character handling, ensuring that the column position is calculated correctly. Now, when the `test_comment_indentation` test function is run, it should pass successfully with this corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
