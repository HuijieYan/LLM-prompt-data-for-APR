### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file.
2. The test function `test_comment_indentation` in the `tests/test_black.py` file is used to check the formatting of code with comments and tabs.
3. The GitHub issue highlights that the indentation of comments after a dedent is being changed incorrectly when tabs are used instead of spaces.
4. The issue seems to be related to how tabs are counted for indentation levels in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be related to the calculation of the `current_column` when encountering tabs.
When a tab character is encountered, the current column should be increased by 4, but the existing implementation increments it only by 1 for each tab character.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of tab characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, leading to incorrect calculation of indentation levels for comments.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `current_column` is incremented by 4 when encountering a tab character, instead of incrementing it by 1 as done in the buggy function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            # Increment current column by 4 for each tab character
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the `current_column` is correctly incremented by 4 when encountering a tab character, fixing the bug related to indentation calculations.
