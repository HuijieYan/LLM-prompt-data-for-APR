### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the partially consumed prefix in the source code.
- The test `test_comment_indentation` checks the behavior of the function with respect to comment indentation.
- The GitHub issue highlights a problem with incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation when using tabs in the input file.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling indentations is flawed, especially when encountering a tab character.
2. There is a need to properly track the column position and handle the indentation levels accurately.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of tab characters in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. When encountering tabs, the function incorrectly increments the current column position, leading to incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the handling of tab characters to correctly track the column position.
2. Adjust the logic for maintaining proper indentation levels when consuming the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                # Adjust the tab handling to increment current_column correctly
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
            else:
                # indent is finished
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the tab handling logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the corrected version should now properly handle tab characters and maintain the correct column position for indentations, resolving the issue of incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation.
