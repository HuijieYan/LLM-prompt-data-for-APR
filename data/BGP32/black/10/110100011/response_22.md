### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation within the input of the `test_comment_indentation` test function.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights that the indentation for comments after dedent is changing incorrectly when using tabs in the input.
- The buggy function does not handle the indentation of comments properly which leads to incorrect formatting.

### Identified Bug Location:
- The bug is likely in the section where the function is checking for indentation levels.
- Incorrect handling of characters (\t, \n) and not adjusting the indentation level properly for comments after dedent.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function does not properly calculate the correct indentation level when encountering comments after dedent in the input.
- This leads to incorrect formatting when tabs are used in the input, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` to handle comments properly after dedent.
- Adjust the current column and indentation levels correctly when encountering comments in the input.
- Ensure that comments maintain the same level of indentation as the following lines.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Updated corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            if char != '#':
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix`, we can ensure that comments after dedent maintain the correct level of indentation as per the input. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the corrected version to pass the failing test.
