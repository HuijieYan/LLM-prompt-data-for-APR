### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a prefix and handling indentation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking if the Black formatter correctly handles comment indentation after a dedent.
3. The GitHub issue highlights incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
4. The bug seems to be related to handling tabulation and newline characters within the prefix.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not properly handle tabulation characters when determining indentation levels. As a result, incorrect indentation is applied to comments after a dedent operation, especially when the input contains tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle tabulation characters to calculate the correct indentation levels. We should ensure that the function identifies the correct column position based on spaces and tabs encountered during prefix consumption.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += 4 - (current_column % 4)
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            else:
                current_line += char
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            res = ''.join(lines)
                            return res, prefix[len(res):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the handling of tabulation characters and correcting the column increment logic, the corrected version of `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now properly handle indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
