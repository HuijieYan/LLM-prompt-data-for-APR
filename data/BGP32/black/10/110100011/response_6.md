### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for incorrectly indenting comments after a dedent.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the test file `test_black.py` showcases the issue where comments are not indented correctly after a dedent.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where the indentation for comments is changing incorrectly after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.
4. The bug occurs due to the logic in `_partially_consume_prefix` not handling the scenario where a comment follows a dedent properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not resetting the `current_column` value after encountering a newline character. This causes the comment to be improperly indented.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the scenario where a comment follows a dedent. This can be done by resetting the `current_column` to the expected column value after encountering a newline character.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Reset column value
                    current_column = column
                else:
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By resetting the `current_column` value appropriately after encountering a newline character, the corrected function should handle the indentation of comments after a dedent correctly.
