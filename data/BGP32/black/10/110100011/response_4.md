### Analysis:
1. The `Driver` class contains the `_partially_consume_prefix` function which is responsible for handling indentation changes in the input code.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the indentation for comments is correctly formatted.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that the indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly when tabs are used in the input file, which aligns with the reported bug in the function.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of tabs and newlines when determining the indentation level.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_partially_consume_prefix` function not correctly counting the column indentation when processing the input code. This leads to incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the function to accurately calculate the column indentation based on spaces and tabs.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the indentation for comments after a dedent.
3. Consider the tab width (usually 4 spaces) in calculations to maintain the correct indentation level.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Imported modules
import re

# Corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
            tab_width = 4  # assuming tab width is 4 spaces
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += tab_width - (current_column % tab_width)
            else:
                current_column += 1
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Correction Summary:
1. Updated the logic to handle both spaces and tabs for calculating the column indentation.
2. Added a condition to correctly calculate the tab width (assumed as 4 spaces).
3. Ensured that the function accurately maintains the indentation level, especially for comments after a dedent.

By implementing these changes, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation and resolve the reported issue.
