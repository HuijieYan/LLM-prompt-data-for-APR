### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is used to partially consume a prefix string based on indentation level.
2. The function contains logic to handle spaces, tabs, newlines, and indentation levels.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of indentation for comments after a dedent, particularly when using tabs.
4. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks the formatting of code with tabs and spaces, focusing on comments and indentation.
5. The GitHub issue reports that Black (a code formatter) incorrectly changes the indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
1. The buggy function does not handle the case of a comment following a dedent correctly when processing the prefix.
2. When encountering a comment after a dedent in the input code with tabs, the function fails to adjust the comment's indentation.
3. This results in incorrect formatting of comments after a dedent, as observed in the failing test and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs.
2. Ensure that the function maintains consistent indentation levels for comments after dedents.
3. Update the function to correctly process the input prefix string regarding comments and indentation levels.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line after dedent
            if current_column < column:
                # Adjust indentation for comments after dedent
                current_line = '\t' * (column // 4) + current_line[current_column:]
                current_column = column
            else:
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Summary:
1. The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function includes extra logic to correctly handle comments following a dedent when using tab indentation.
2. By adjusting the comment's indentation after a dedent, the function ensures consistent formatting for such scenarios.
3. The corrected function should pass the failing test related to comment indentation and address the GitHub issue regarding incorrect changes in indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.
