### Analysis:
1. In the `Driver` class, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on the input columns.
2. The function processes each character in the prefix string and determines the current line, column, and whether to wait for a newline character.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the indentation when a newline character is encountered.
4. Based on the failing test `test_comment_indentation`, the bug affects the indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input.
5. The GitHub issue describes the incorrect behavior when the input file uses tabs, and the comment indentation is altered after a dedent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function due to incorrect handling of the conditions related to newline characters and indentation levels. When encountering a newline character, the function should adjust the indentation for the next line properly, which is not happening. This results in incorrect comment indentation after a dedent operation, especially when using tabs in the input.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles newline characters, adjusts the current column as needed, and maintains the proper indentation when processing the prefix string.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = True
        else:
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After applying the corrections to the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, the function should now handle newline characters, indentation levels, and comment alignment correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test related to comment indentation issues described in the GitHub issue.
