### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` within the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming the prefix in a given text based on the provided column value. This function is used in the context of formatting code.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is testing the behavior of the function when dealing with indentation and comments.
- The GitHub issue provides details about how the indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent in the code when using the Black formatter.
- The root cause of the bug seems to be related to the condition checks and handling of different characters within the `prefix` string leading to incorrect behavior during indentation processing.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of '\n' characters
2. Incorrect calculation of the current column
3. Logic for managing indentation levels and comments

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect logic implemented within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Specifically, when encountering a new line character ('\n'), the function does not correctly handle the indentation level for comments as shown in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Review and update the condition checks for '\n' characters to ensure proper handling of indentation levels before and after comments.
- Adjust the logic related to tracking the current column to accurately reflect the indentation in the text.
- Implement a better approach to manage the indentation and comments based on the provided column value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            elif wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':  # Handle new line character within indentation
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                else:
                    current_line += char
            else:
                if char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
                else:
                    if current_column < column:  # Adjust current column based on the indentation level
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    current_line += char
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

### Explanation of Correction:
- The corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the issues by properly handling the new line character, updating the current column value after tabs and spaces, and adjusting the logic to handle indentation levels and comments accurately.
- The fixes aim to ensure the function behaves correctly when processing indentation and comments, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to incorrect changes in indentation for tabulated comments with the Black formatter.
