### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py` file.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in `tests/test_black.py` is designed to check for correct comment indentation after dedent within a code snippet.
3. The GitHub issue describes the problem of incorrect comment indentation when using tabs in the code.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles whitespace and newlines while parsing the input prefix.

### Error Location:
The bug may be in the logic related to handling the `wait_for_nl` flag and determining when to append `current_line` to `lines`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic to track whether to wait for a newline (`wait_for_nl`) is not reset properly after encountering a newline character. This causes issues with correctly indenting comments after a dedent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `wait_for_nl` flag is correctly reset when encountering a newline character.
2. Check the condition for determining when to append `current_line` to `lines` after dedent.
3. Make sure that the function correctly calculates the indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 1
                elif char == '\t':
                    current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = True
            else:
                wait_for_nl = False
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by resetting the `wait_for_nl` flag correctly after encountering a newline character. It also ensures that the logic for tracking the current column and waiting for a newline character works as expected. With these changes, the function should now handle comment indentation correctly after dedent, as indicated in the failing test case and the GitHub issue description.
