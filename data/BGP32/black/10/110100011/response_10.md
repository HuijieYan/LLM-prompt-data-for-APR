### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling partial consumption of a prefix line with specified column indentation.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights a problem with incorrect indentation of comments after a dedent when using tabs in the input file.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if Black is able to correctly handle comment indentation after a dedent in both space and tab indentation scenarios.

### Identified Error:
- The buggy function seems to have issues with correctly identifying the indentation level and handling comments after dedent operations.
- The logic within the function does not appropriately handle cases where the comment indentation needs to be preserved after a dedent.
- This results in the incorrect reformatting of comments after a dedent operation when using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
- The code fails to correctly track the indentation level after dedent operations due to incorrect handling of comments within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
- This leads to the incorrect reformatting of comments following a dedent, especially when tabs are used, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The function needs to be modified to accurately track the column indentation level and preserve the correct indentation of comments after a dedent operation.
- Adjust the logic to handle tab indentation correctly and ensure that comments are appropriately aligned with the rest of the code.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                actual_column = len(current_line.expandtabs())
                if current_line.strip() and actual_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces equivalent to tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should now correctly handle tab indentation and preserve the correct indentation of comments after dedent operations, ensuring that the failing test `test_comment_indentation` passes and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding incorrect comment indentation.
