## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for handling partial consumption of a prefix based on indentation.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` tests the behavior of the function when dealing with tabulation and comments.
3. The GitHub issue reports that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, specifically when using tabs.
4. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a comment after a dedent, leading to incorrect indentation for the comment.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition where a comment is encountered after a dedent (`current_column < column`). The function fails to adjust the indentation correctly for the comment in such cases, resulting in the incorrect output.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a comment is encountered after a dedent, its indentation is adjusted to match the previous line's indentation correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                
                if not current_line.lstrip().startswith("#"):  # Check if line is not a comment
                    lines.append(current_line)
                
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding a check to ensure that comment lines are not added to the lines list when encountered after a dedent, we can address the bug and correct the indentation behavior for comments after a dedent in the given test scenario.
