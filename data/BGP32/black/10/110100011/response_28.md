### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
- The function is responsible for consuming a prefix of characters until a certain column is reached while keeping track of the current line and column position.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition `current_column < column` seems incorrect as it should be `current_column <= column`.
2. In the case of '\n', the reset of `current_line` and `current_column` should be inside the `if char == '\n':` block, not outside it.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the current line and column positions. When encountering a newline character, the reset of `current_line` and `current_column` happens outside the necessary block, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Move the reset of `current_line` and `current_column` inside the `if char == '\n':` block.
- Update the condition to check `current_column <= column`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
            # reset line and column for a newline character
            current_line = ""
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the prefix consumption correctly based on the specified column position. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
