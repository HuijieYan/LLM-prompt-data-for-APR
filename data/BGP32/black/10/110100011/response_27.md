## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class in the file `driver.py`.
2. The test scenario `test_comment_indentation` in the file `test_black.py` is failing because of incorrect handling of indentation in the buggy function.
3. The GitHub issue describes a specific problem related to changing the indentation for comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs in the input file.
4. The cause of the bug is the logic within `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is not correctly handling the indentation levels for comments after dedent.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of tab characters (`\t`) when calculating the current column for indentation. Due to the inconsistent treatment of tabs in the original implementation, the function fails to maintain correct indentation levels for comments after a dedent when using tabs.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the way tab characters are counted when calculating the current column. Consistent handling of tab characters is essential to ensure correct indentation levels are maintained. Additionally, the logic for handling comments after dedent needs to be improved for accurate results.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            else:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
                if wait_for_nl:
                    if char == '\n':
                        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                            return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                        lines.append(current_line)
                        current_line = ""
                        current_column = 0
                        wait_for_nl = False
                elif char == ' ':
                    current_column += 3  # Assuming each space counts as 1 column
                elif char == '\n':
                    current_column = 0
                else:
                    wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By making these changes, we ensure that both tabs and spaces are handled correctly when calculating the current column for indentation. This corrected version should pass the failing test scenario related to comment indentation issues after a dedent.
