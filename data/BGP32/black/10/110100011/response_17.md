### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the class `Driver` in the file `blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the behavior of the code formatter with respect to comments and indentation.
3. The GitHub issue reports the problem with incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles tabs, spaces, and newlines when processing the input prefix.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the function not correctly handling the indentation level of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used in the input. The logic to check and update the `current_column` is not functioning as expected for tabulated comments.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function processes tab characters and correctly maintains the indentation level, especially for comments. By properly tracking the column position with tab characters, we can ensure that the comments are correctly aligned after a dedent.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            if char == '\t':
                current_column += (4 - (current_column % 4))  # Align to next tab stop
            else:
                current_column += 1
            current_line += char
            
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ' or char == '\t':
                pass
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to correctly handle tab characters, update the `current_column` based on tab stops, and ensure proper alignment of comments after a dedent. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
