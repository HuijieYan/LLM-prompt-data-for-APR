### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for partially consuming a prefix based on certain conditions like spaces, tabs, and new lines while maintaining the correct column position.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` is checking the indentation of comments after dedenting within the `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`.
3. The GitHub issue reported a problem where the indentation of comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent, especially when using tabs instead of spaces.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function seems to be related to the way it handles the indentation calculation for comments. Specifically, the logic to check if an indent is finished (`wait_for_nl = True`) seems to be triggered incorrectly, causing the comments to be incorrectly indented after a dedent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic to handle the end of an indent (`wait_for_nl = True`) is triggered correctly and that it correctly considers the column position for comments within the prefix.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                while current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the logic inside the `if wait_for_nl` block and ensuring that comments are correctly handled in terms of column position, this corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
