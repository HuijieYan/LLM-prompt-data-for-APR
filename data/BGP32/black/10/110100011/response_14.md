### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` in the `Driver` class is responsible for partially consuming a prefix while maintaining the column position in the source code.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` in the test file reveals that the function is incorrectly handling the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent in the presence of tabs in the input file.

### Identified Bug Locations:
1. The logic for handling the `wait_for_nl` flag and determining the correct column position seems to be flawed.
2. The handling of tabs and spaces for column calculation appears to be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function leads to incorrect handling of tabulated comments after a dedent in the source code. It fails to properly maintain the expected indentation when tabs are used, resulting in incorrectly formatted code.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic related to `wait_for_nl` flag to correctly identify the end of an indent block.
2. Adjust the logic for handling tabs and spaces in calculating the column position accurately.
3. Ensure that the function correctly maintains the expected comment indentation after a dedent, considering the input source code with tabs or spaces.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char

            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4  # Update tab column increment to match coding convention
            elif char == '\n':
                # unexpected empty line
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False  # Reset wait_for_nl when encountering a newline
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True  # Set wait_for_nl when indent is finished
        
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrections implemented in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function as shown above, it should now handle the indentation of comments correctly after a dedent and pass the failing test related to tabulated comments in the presence of tabs as noted in the GitHub issue.
