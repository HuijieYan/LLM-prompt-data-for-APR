### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is part of the `Driver` class.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks for incorrect behavior related to comment indentation.
3. The GitHub issue describes a specific problem where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent when using tabs.
4. The buggy function fails to handle the scenario where a comment is encountered after a dedent.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` does not correctly handle the case where a comment should be indented to match the next line after a dedent.
2. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function does not adjust the column appropriately, leading to incorrect indentation.
3. This issue aligns with the problem described in the GitHub issue where comments are incorrectly indented after a dedent, especially when using tabs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation logic when encountering a comment after a dedent.
2. When a comment is encountered, ensure that its column is adjusted to match the next line's indentation level.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip().startswith('#'):  # Adjust column for comment
                    current_column = column
                else:
                    current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adding the condition to adjust the column for comments in the '\n' case, the corrected function should now handle the correct indentation for comments after a dedent, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
