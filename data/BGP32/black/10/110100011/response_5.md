### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling the indentation of comments in the input code.
2. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if the comments are correctly indented after dedent operations.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent operation when using tabs.
4. The bug occurs when encountering a comment after dedent.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when encountering a comment after dedent. If the comment is preceded by spaces or tabs, the comment's indentation is not handled correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling comments after dedent to ensure that the correct indentation is maintained.
2. Consider the existing logic for handling indentation.
3. Adjust the logic to correctly handle comments after dedent with spaces or tabs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class Driver(object):
    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
                if current_line.lstrip().startswith('#'):
                    current_column = column
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

After making the above changes, the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now correctly handle the indentation of comments after dedent operations.
