### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to handle indentation in a code snippet.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` specifically tests the behavior of the function for tab and space indentation.
- The GitHub issue highlights that the function fails to properly format comments after a dedent, especially when tabs are used for indentation.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling comments after a dedent in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
2. The calculation of the indentation level based on spaces and tabs.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_partially_consume_prefix` function does not handle indentation correctly, specifically with tabulated comments after a dedent. This leads to incorrect reformatting of comments in the test cases provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle comments after a dedent.
2. Ensure that the function properly tracks the indentation level using spaces and tabs to preserve the correct formatting.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the _partially_consume_prefix function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for idx, char in enumerate(prefix):
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # not space, tab or newline
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            elif wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    # indentation is finished
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                if char != ' ' and char != '\t':
                    current_line += char
        
        if wait_for_nl and current_column >= column:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            wait_for_nl = False
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By modifying the handling of characters and indentation levels in the function, the corrected version should now properly preserve the formatting of comments after a dedent when spaces or tabs are used.
