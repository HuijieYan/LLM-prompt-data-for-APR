### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to handle indentation of comments after a dedent in a specific way, but due to some logic issues, it fails to do so.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` checks if comments are correctly formatted after dedents, and it fails because the buggy function is not working as intended.
- The GitHub issue reports a similar problem where indentation for comments after a dedent is changed incorrectly when using tabs in the input file.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:` seems incorrect as it should base the substring only on the current line and column relationship.
2. The logic around `wait_for_nl` and newline characters may not be handling the expected behavior correctly.
3. Incorrect handling of spaces and tabs for calculating the current column.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the partial consumption of the prefix string in `_partially_consume_prefix`. This function is responsible for processing the input prefix string and ensuring correct indentation for subsequent lines, including comments. The issue stems from a combination of incorrect conditions and logic within the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly processes the input prefix string based on the expected column indentation. Specifically, we need to focus on correctly identifying the end of the line and ensuring that comments are aligned correctly after a dedent. Adjusting the logic surrounding newline characters, spaces, tabs, and column tracking will likely resolve the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if not wait_for_nl and current_line.strip() and len(current_line.expandtabs()) < column:
                lines.append(current_line)
                
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By adjusting the conditions and logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, the corrected version should now correctly handle the partial consumption of the prefix while maintaining the correct column alignment for comments after a dedent. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
