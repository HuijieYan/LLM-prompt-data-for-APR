Based on the buggy function and the failing test provided, the issue arises from the `_partially_consume_prefix` function incorrectly handling the indentation level for comments after a dedent. When encountering a comment after a dedent, the function fails to preserve the previous indentation level for the comment.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation level for comments after a dedent.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
class Driver(object):

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:  # Check the last line after the loop
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

        return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should now handle the indentation for comments after a dedent correctly, ensuring that the output matches the expected formatting and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
