## Analysis:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is incorrectly handling the indentation level of comments when tabs are used in the input. This bug is causing incorrect behavior in the formatting of code when there are comments past depth 0.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect logic for handling tabs and spaces in the input.
2. Incorrect identification of the start of a new line for comments.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the logic inside the `_partially_consume_prefix` function's handling of tabs and spaces. When encountering tabs, the function incorrectly calculates the column position, leading to incorrect indentation of comments.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the calculations for the column position when encountering tabs.
2. Ensure that the start of a new line is correctly identified for comments.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
    
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == '\t':
            # Adjust column position for tabs
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char in (' ', '\n'):
            # Reset column position for spaces and new lines
            current_column += 1
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle tabs, spaces, and the start of new lines, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
