### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class.
2. The function is responsible for consuming a prefix up to a specific column number, handling indentation, tabs, and new lines.
3. The failing test `test_comment_indentation` focuses on testing the behavior of the function in relation to comment indentation.
4. The GitHub issue highlights incorrect behavior in the indentation of comments following dedents with tab usage.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling indentation and newline characters within the function is flawed.
2. The condition checking for `wait_for_nl` might not be triggering correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when handling comments.
3. The check for `current_column` against the specified `column` might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the mishandling of newline characters and indentation tracking within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. This causes incorrect handling of comments following dedents when tabs are used, as observed in the failing test case. Specifically, the logic for waiting for a newline after dedents is flawed, leading to incorrect comment indentation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate tracking of columns and newline characters.
2. Adjust the logic for waiting for a newline to correctly handle comment indentation.
3. Verify that comments are correctly aligned based on column positions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column <= column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By correcting the logic within the function to accurately handle newline characters and column positions, the corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test case related to comment indentation.
