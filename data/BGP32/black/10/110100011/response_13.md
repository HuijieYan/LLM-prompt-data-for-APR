### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is a method of the `Driver` class.
2. The function is responsible for partially consuming the prefix of a given string based on certain conditions related to indentation and new line characters.
3. The issue reported on GitHub relates to incorrect behavior when dealing with tabulated comments after a dedent operation.
4. The failing test case `test_comment_indentation` focuses on comparing the reformatting of code using both tabs and spaces and checking if the indentation for comments is preserved correctly.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The function does not handle the indentation of comments properly, especially when using tabs, leading to incorrect formatting.
2. The logic within the function does not appropriately consider the special cases where a comment follows a dedent operation using tabs.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not account for the specific scenario mentioned in the GitHub issue where a comment should maintain the same level of indentation as the line following it after a dedent operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent operation.
2. Check for cases where a comment follows a dedent operation and ensure that the comment retains the same indentation level as the next line.
3. Maintain consistency in handling both spaces and tabs to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_column > 0 and prefix[prefix.index(char) + 1] == '\t':
                current_column = 4  # Adjust column for tab indentation
            else:
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

By updating the logic within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function to handle the special case of comments following a dedent operation, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
