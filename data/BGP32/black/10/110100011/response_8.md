### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is responsible for handling indentation in the code.
- The failing test `test_comment_indentation` tests the behavior of the indentation for comments in the code.
- The GitHub issue highlights a problem where the indentation for comments is incorrectly changed after a dedent when using tabs.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of indentation levels.
2. Incorrect updating of the `current_column`.
3. Incorrect handling of the wait condition for new lines.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function `_partially_consume_prefix` handles the indentation levels with tabs. It fails to correctly track the column position and handle the wait condition for new lines, leading to incorrect indentation for comments after a dedent operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the calculation of `current_column` based on the type of character.
- Update the logic for handling new lines and wait conditions for maintaining correct indentation levels.
- Ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario where tabs are used.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = ((current_column // 4) + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            current_column = 0
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
``` 

### Changes Made:
- Updated the logic for calculating `current_column` when encountering tabs to align it with the next multiple of 4 spaces.
- Added conditions to handle new lines correctly and ensure correct indentation levels after dedent operations.

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test related to comment indentation.
